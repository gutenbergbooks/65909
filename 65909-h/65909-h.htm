<div class="transnote">
<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Footnote anchors are denoted by <span class="fnanchor">[number]</span>,
and the footnotes have been placed at the end of the relevant entry. Footnotes for Tables I-XVI
have been kept at the bottom of each relevant Table.</p>

<p>Basic fractions are displayed as ½ ⅓ ¼ etc; other fractions are mostly
shown in the form <sup>a</sup>/<sub>b</sub>, for example <sup>4</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.
The book also has some fractions in the form a-b, for example 1-40th or 7-100ths.</p>

<p>Each entry in the dictionary is a Latin name and uses vowel breves
and macrons to indicate pronunciation. Greek words in the text use
polytonic Greek. Some other less common characters are found in this
book and these will display on this device as:<br />
<span class="pad2">⛛ &nbsp; &nbsp; (0x26DB inverted Greek Δ)</span><br />
<span class="pad2">M̄ &nbsp; &nbsp; (M with 0x0304 combining macron)</span><br />
<span class="pad2">C̄ &nbsp; &nbsp; (C with 0x0304 combining macron)</span><br />
<span class="pad2">⬤ &nbsp; &nbsp; (0x2B24 black circle)</span><br />
</p>

<p>Several of the <a href="#TABLES">Tables</a> at the back of the book are
very dense and wider than can be displayed on some devices. Use of a
small-size font may help.</p>

<p>The original text was printed in two-column format; the indexes at
the back of the book reference the page and the column, a (left) or
b (right). This etext uses the normal single column format so that the
column reference does not apply; only the page reference is relevant.</p>

<p class="customcover">The cover image was created by the transcriber
and is placed in the public domain.</p>

<p>Some minor changes to the text are noted at the <a href="#TN">end of the book.</a></p>

<p id="Abacus" class="p2 drop-capy">ĂBĂCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄβαξ</span>), denoted primarily a square
tablet of any description, and was hence
employed in the following significations:&mdash;(1)
A table, or side-board, chiefly used for
the display of gold and silver cups, and other
kinds of valuable and ornamental utensils.
The use of abaci was first introduced at Rome
from Asia Minor after the victories of Cn.
Manlius Vulso, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 187, and their introduction
was regarded as one of the marks
of the growing luxury of the age.&mdash;(2) A
draught-board or chess-board.&mdash;(3) A board
used by mathematicians for drawing diagrams,
and by arithmeticians for the purposes
of calculation.&mdash;(4) A painted panel,
coffer, or square compartment in the wall
or ceiling of a chamber.&mdash;(5) In architecture,
the flat square stone which constituted
the highest member of a column,
being placed immediately under the architrave.

<p id="Abolla">ABOLLA, a cloak chiefly worn by soldiers,
and thus opposed to the toga, the
garb of peace. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Toga">Toga</a>.</span>] The abolla was
used by the lower classes at Rome, and consequently
by the philosophers who affected
severity of manners and life. Hence the expression
of Juvenal, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facinus majoris abollae</i>,&mdash;“a
crime committed by a very deep philosopher.”</p>

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκενα</span>, in one place <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκαινον</span>), a measuring rod
of the length of ten Greek feet. It was used
in measuring land, and thus resembles the
Roman decempeda.</p>


<p id="Acatium">ĂCATĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκάτιον</span>, a diminutive of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκατος</span>),
a small vessel or boat used by the Greeks,
which appears to have been the same as the
Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scapha</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acatia</i> were also sails
adapted for fast sailing.</p>


<p id="Accensus">ACCENSUS. (1) A public officer, who
attended on several of the Roman magistrates.
The Accensi summoned the people to
the assemblies, and those who had law-suits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
to court; they preserved order in the courts,
and proclaimed the time of the day when it
was the third hour, the sixth hour, and the
ninth hour. An accensus anciently preceded
the consul who had not the fasces, which
custom, after being long disused, was restored
by Julius Cæsar in his first consulship.
Accensi also attended on the governors of
provinces.&mdash;(2) The accensi were also a class
of soldiers in the Roman army, who were
enlisted after the full number of the legion
had been completed, in order to supply any
vacancies that might occur in the legion.
They were taken, according to the census of
Servius Tullius, from the fifth class of citizens,
and were placed in battle in the rear of the
army, behind the triarii.</p>


<p id="Acclamatio">ACCLĀMĀTĬO, was the public expression
of approbation or disapprobation, pleasure or
displeasure, by loud acclamations. On many
occasions, there appear to have been certain
forms of acclamations always used by the Romans;
as, for instance, at marriages, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Io
Hymen</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hymenaee</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Talassio</i>; at triumphs,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Io Triumphe</i>; at the conclusion of plays, the
last actor called out <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plaudite</i> to the spectators;
orators were usually praised by such expressions
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bene et praeclare</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Belle et festive</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non potest melius</i>, &amp;c. Under the empire the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acclamationes</i> was given to the praises
and flatteries bestowed by the senate upon the
reigning emperor and his family.</p>


<p id="Accubatio">ACCŬBĀTĬO, the act of reclining at meals.
The Greeks and Romans were accustomed, in
later times, to recline at their meals; but
this practice could not have been of great antiquity
in Greece, since Homer always describes
persons as sitting at their meals; and
Isidore of Seville, an ancient grammarian,
also attributes the same custom to the ancient
Romans. Even in the time of the early
Roman emperors, children in families of the
highest rank used to sit together, while their
fathers and elders reclined on couches at the
upper part of the room. Roman ladies continued
the practice of sitting at table, even
after the recumbent position had become
common with the other sex. It appears to
have been considered more decent, and more
agreeable to the severity and purity of ancient
manners, for women to sit, more especially if
many persons were present. But, on the
other hand, we find cases of women reclining,
where there was conceived to be nothing bold
or indelicate in their posture. Such is the
case in the preceding woodcut, which seems
intended to represent a scene of matrimonial
felicity. For an account of the disposition of
the couches, and of the place which each
guest occupied in a Greek and Roman entertainment,

or censer used in sacrifices. The
acerra was also a small moveable altar placed
before the dead, on which perfumes were
burnt. The use of acerrae at funerals was
forbidden by a law of the Twelve Tables as
an unnecessary expense.</p>

also given to all cups resembling it in size and
form, to whatever use they might be applied.&mdash;(2)
A Roman measure of capacity, fluid
and dry. It was one-fourth of the hemian,
and therefore one-eighth of the sextarius.</p>

<p id="Achaicum">ĂCHĀĬCUM FOEDUS. The Achaean league
is divided into two periods. 1. <em>The earlier
period.</em>&mdash;When the Heracleidae took possession
of Peloponnesus, which had until then
been chiefly inhabited by Achaeans, a portion
of the latter, under Tisamenus, turned northwards
and occupied the north coast of Peloponnesus.
The country thus occupied derived
from them its name of Achaia, and
contained twelve confederate towns, which
were governed by the descendants of Tisamenus,
till at length they abolished the
kingly rule after the death of Ogyges, and
established a democracy. In the time of Herodotus
the twelve towns of which the league
consisted were: Pellene, Aegeira, Aegae,
Bura, Helice, Aegium, Rhypes (Rhypae), Patreis
(ae), Phareis (ae), Olenus, Dyme, and
Tritaeeis (Tritaea). After the time of Herodotus,
Rhypes and Aegae disappeared from
the number, and Ceryneia and Leontium
stepped into their place. The bond which
united the towns of the league was not so
much a political as a religious one, as is
shown by the common sacrifice offered at
Helice to Poseidon, and after the destruction
of that town, at Aegium to Zeus, surnamed
Homagyrius, and to Demeter Panachaea.
The confederation exercised no great influence
in the affairs of Greece down to the time
when it was broken up by the Macedonians.
2. <em>The later period.</em>&mdash;When Antigonus in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 281 made the unsuccessful attempt to
deprive Ptolemaeus Ceraunus of the Macedonian
throne, the Achaeans availed themselves
of the opportunity of shaking off the
Macedonian yoke, and renewing their ancient
confederation. The grand object however
now was no longer a common worship, but a
real political union among the confederates.
The fundamental laws were, that henceforth
the confederacy should form one inseparable
state, that each town, which should join it,
should have equal rights with the others, and
that all members, in regard to foreign countries,
should be considered as dependent, and
bound to obey in every respect the federal
government, and those officers who were entrusted
with the executive. Aegium was the
seat of the government, and it was there that
the citizens of the various towns met at regular
and stated times, to deliberate upon the
common affairs of the league, and if it was
thought necessary, upon those of separate
towns, and even of individuals, and to
elect the officers of the league. The league
acquired its great strength in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 251, when
Aratus united Sicyon, his native place, with
it, and some years later gained Corinth also
for it. Megara, Troezene, and Epidaurus
soon followed their example. Afterwards
Aratus persuaded all the more important
towns of Peloponnesus to join the confederacy,
and thus Megalopolis, Argos, Hermione,
Phlius, and others were added to it. In a
short period the league reached the height of
its power, for it embraced Athens, Megara,
Aegina, Salamis, and the whole of Peloponnesus,
with the exception of Sparta, Elis,
Tegea, Orchomenos, and Mantineia. The
common affairs of the confederate towns were
regulated at general meetings attended by the
citizens of all the towns, and held regularly
twice every year, in the spring and in the
autumn. These meetings, which lasted three
days, were held in a grove of Zeus Homagyrius
in the neighbourhood of Aegium, and near
a sanctuary of Demeter Panachaea. Every
citizen, both rich and poor, who had attained
the age of thirty, might attend the assemblies,
to which they were invited by a public herald,
and might speak and propose any measure.
The subjects which were to be brought before
the assembly were prepared by a council
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλή</span>), which seems to have been permanent.
The principal officers of the confederacy were:
1. At first two strategi (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατηγοί</span>), but
after the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 255 there was only one,
who in conjunction with an hipparchus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴππαρχος</span>)
or commander of the cavalry and an
under-strategus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποστρατηγός</span>) commanded
the army furnished by the confederacy, and
was entrusted with the whole conduct of war;
2. A public secretary (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραμματεύς</span>); and, 3.
Ten demiurgi (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημιουργοί</span>). All the officers of
the league were elected in the assembly held
in the spring, at the rising of the Pleiades,
and legally they were invested with their
several offices only for one year, though it
frequently happened that men of great merit
and distinction were re-elected for several
successive years. If one of the officers died
during the period of his office, his place was
filled by his predecessor, until the time for
the new elections arrived. The perpetual
discord of the members of the league, the
hostility of Sparta, the intrigues of the Romans,
and the folly and rashness of the later
strategi, brought about not only the destruction
and dissolution of the confederacy, but
of the freedom of all Greece, which after the
fall of Corinth, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 146, became a Roman
province under the name of Achaia.</p>

<p id="Acinaces">ĂCĪNĂCĒS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκινάκης</span>), a Persian sword,
whence Horace speaks of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medus acinaces</i>.
The acinaces was a short and straight weapon,
and thus differed from the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sica</i>,
which was curved. It was worn on the right
side of the body, whereas the Greeks and Romans
usually had their swords suspended on
the left side. The form of the acinaces, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the mode of wearing it, is illustrated by the
following Persepolitan figures.</p>

<p id="Acroama">ACROĀMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρόαμα</span>), which properly
means any thing heard, was the name given
to a concert of players on different musical
instruments, and also to an interlude performed
during the exhibition of the public
games. The word is also applied to the
actors and musicians who were employed to
amuse guests during an entertainment, and
is sometimes used to designate the anagnostae.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Anagnostes">Anagnostes</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Acrolithi">ACRŎLĬTHI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρόλιθοι</span>), statues, of which

gilt or covered with drapery.</p>


<p id="Acropolis">ACRŎPŎLIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρόπολις</span>). In almost all
Greek states, which were usually built upon
a hill, rock, or some natural elevation, there
was a castle or a citadel, erected upon the
highest part of the rock or hill, to which the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acropolis</i>, higher or upper city, was
given. Thus we read of an acropolis at
Athens, Corinth, Argos, Messene, and many
other places. The Capitolium at Rome answered
the same purpose as the Acropolis in
the Greek cities; and of the same kind were
the tower of Agathocles at Utica, and that of
Antonia at Jerusalem.</p>


<p id="Acrostolium">ACROSTŎLĬUM. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Navis">Navis</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Acroterium">ACRŎTĒRĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρωτήριον</span>), signifies the
extremity of any thing, and was applied by
the Greeks to the extremities of the prow of
a vessel (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκροστόλιον</span>), which were usually
taken from a conquered vessel as a mark of
victory: the act of doing so was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρωτηριάζειν</span>.
In architecture it signifies, 1.
The sloping roof of a building. 2. The pediment.
3. The pedestals for statues placed
on the summit of a pediment. In sculpture
it signifies the extremities of a statue, as
wings, feet, hands, &amp;c.</p>


<p id="Acta">ACTA. (1) The public acts and orders of
a Roman magistrate, which after the expiration
of his office were submitted to the senate
for approval or rejection. Under the empire,
all the magistrates when entering upon their
office on the 1st of January swore approval
of the acts of the reigning emperor.&mdash;(2)
<span class="smcap">Acta Forensia</span> were of two kinds: first,
those relating to the government, as leges,
plebiscita, edicta, the names of all the magistrates,
&amp;c., which formed part of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae
publicae</i>; and secondly, those connected with
the courts of law.&mdash;(3) <span class="smcap">Acta Militaria</span>,
contained an account of the duties, numbers,
and expenses of each legion, and were probably
preserved in the military treasury
founded by Augustus.&mdash;(4) <span class="smcap">Acta Senatus</span>,
called also <span class="smcap">Commentarii Senatus</span> and <span class="smcap">Acta
Patrum</span>, contained an account of the various
matters brought before the senate, the opinions
of the chief speakers, and the decision
of the house. By command of Julius Caesar
they were published regularly every day as
part of the government gazette. Augustus
forbade the publication of the proceedings of
the senate, but they still continued to be preserved,
and one of the most distinguished
senators was chosen by the emperor to compile
the account.&mdash;(5) <span class="smcap">Acta Diurna</span>, a gazette
published daily at Rome by the authority
of the government, during the later times
of the republic and under the empire, corresponding
in some measure to our newspapers.
They were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Publica</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Urbana</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta Rerum Urbanarum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta
Populi</i>, and sometimes simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acta</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diurna</i>.
They contained, 1. A list of births and
deaths in the city, an account of the money
paid into the treasury from the provinces,
and every thing relating to the supply of
corn. 2. Extracts from the Acta Forensia.
3. Extracts from the Acta Senatus. 4. A
court circular, containing an account of
the births, deaths, festivals, and movements
of the imperial family. 5. An account of
such public affairs and foreign wars as the
government thought proper to publish. 6.
Curious and interesting occurrences, such as
prodigies and miracles, the erection of new
edifices, the conflagration of buildings, funerals,
sacrifices, a list of the various games,
and especially curious tales and adventures,
with the names of the parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>


<p id="Actia">ACTĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκτια</span>), a festival celebrated every
four years at Actium in Epirus, with wrestling,
horse-racing, and sea-fights, in honour
of Apollo. There was a celebrated temple of
Apollo at Actium. After the defeat of Antony
off Actium, Augustus enlarged the
temple, and instituted games to be celebrated
every five years in commemoration of his
victory.</p>


<p id="Actio">ACTĬO, is defined by a Roman jurist to be
the right of pursuing by judicial means what
is a man’s due. The old actions of the Roman
law were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legis actiones</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legitimae</i>,
either because they were expressly
provided for by the laws of the Twelve Tables,
or because they were strictly adapted to
the words of the laws, and therefore could
not be varied. But these forms of action
gradually fell into disuse, in consequence of
the excessive nicety required, and the failure
consequent on the slightest error in the pleadings,
and they were eventually abolished by
the Lex Aebutia, and two Leges Juliae, except
in a few cases. In the old Roman constitution,
the knowledge of the law was most
closely connected with the institutes and
ceremonial of religion, and was accordingly
in the hands of the patricians alone, whose
aid their clients were obliged to ask in all
their legal disputes. App. Claudius Caecus,
perhaps one of the earliest writers on law,
drew up the various forms of actions, probably
for his own use and that of his friends:
the manuscript was stolen or copied by his
scribe Cn. Flavius, who made it public; and
thus, according to the story, the plebeians
became acquainted with those legal forms
which hitherto had been the exclusive property
of the patricians. After the abolition
of the old legal actions, a suit was prosecuted
in the following manner:&mdash;An action was
commenced by the plaintiff summoning the
defendant to appear before the praetor or
other magistrate who had <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jurisdictio</i>; this
process was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jus vocatio</i>; and, according
to the laws of the Twelve Tables, was
in effect a dragging of the defendant before
the praetor, if he refused to go quietly; and
although this rude proceeding was somewhat
modified in later times, we find in the time
of Horace that if the defendant would not go
quietly, the plaintiff called on any bystander
to witness, and dragged the defendant into
court. The parties might settle their dispute
on their way to the court, or the defendant
might be bailed by a vindex. The vindex
must not be confounded with the vades. This
settlement of disputes on the way was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transactio in via</i>, and serves to explain a
passage in St. Matthew, v. 25. When before
the praetor, the parties were said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure agere</i>.
The plaintiff then prayed for an action, and
if the praetor allowed it (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dabat actionem</i>), he
then declared what action he intended to
bring against the defendant, which he called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edere actionem</i>. This might be done in writing,
or orally, or by the plaintiff taking the
defendant to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">album</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Album">Album</a></span>], and showing
him which action he intended to rely on.
As the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">formulae</i> on the album comprehended,
or were supposed to comprehend, every possible
form of action that could be required by
a plaintiff, it was presumed that he could
find among all the formulae some one which
was adapted to his case; and he was, accordingly,
supposed to be without excuse if
he did not take pains to select the proper
formula. If he took the wrong one, or if
he claimed more than his due, he lost his
cause (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa cadebat</i>); but the praetor sometimes
gave him leave to amend his claim or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intentio</i>. It will be observed, that as the
formulae were so numerous and comprehensive,
the plaintiff had only to select the formula
which he supposed to be suitable to
his case, and it would require no further
variation than the insertion of the names of
the parties and of the thing claimed, or the
subject-matter of the suit, with the amount
of damages, &amp;c., as the case might be. When
the praetor had granted an action, the plaintiff
required the defendant to give security
for his appearance before the praetor (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
jure</i>) on a day named, commonly the day but
one after the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jus vocatio</i>, unless the matter
in dispute was settled at once. The defendant,
on finding a surety, was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vades dare</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vadimonium promittere</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facere</i>; the surety,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vas</i>, was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spondere</i>; the plaintiff, when
satisfied with the surety, was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vadari
reum</i>, to let him go on his sureties, or to
have sureties from him. When the defendant
promised to appear <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jure</i> on the day
named, without giving any surety, this was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vadimonium purum</i>. In some cases,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recuperatores</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Judex">Judex</a></span>] were named, who, in
case of the defendant making default, condemned
him in the sum of money named in
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vadimonium</i>. If the defendant appeared
on the day appointed, he was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vadimonium
sistere</i>; if he did not appear, he was
said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vadimonium deseruisse</i>; and the praetor
gave to the plaintiff the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonorum possessio</i>.
Both parties, on the day appointed, were
summoned by a crier (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praeco</i>), when the
plaintiff made his claim or demand, which
was very briefly expressed, and may be considered
as corresponding to our declaration
at law. The defendant might either deny
the plaintiff’s claim, or he might reply to it
by a plea, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exceptio</i>. If he simply denied the
plaintiff’s claim, the cause was at issue, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
a judex might be demanded. The forms of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exceptio</i>, also, were contained in the praetor’s
edict, or, upon hearing the facts, the
praetor adapted the plea to the case. The
plaintiff might reply to the defendant’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exceptio</i>.
The plaintiff’s answer was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">replicatio</i>. If the defendant answered the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">replicatio</i>, his answer was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duplicatio</i>;
and the parties might go on to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triplicatio</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadruplicatio</i>, and even further, if the
matters in question were such that they
could not otherwise be brought to an issue.
A person might maintain or defend an action
by his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognitor</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">procurator</i>, or, as we should
say, by his attorney. The plaintiff and defendant
used a certain form of words in appointing
a cognitor, and it would appear that
the appointment was made in the presence of
both parties. The cognitor needed not to be
present, and his appointment was complete
when by his acts he had signified his assent.
When the cause was brought to an issue, a
judex or judices might be demanded of the
praetor, who named or appointed a judex,
and delivered to him the formula, which contained
his instructions. The judices were
said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dari</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">addici</i>. So far the proceedings
were said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jure</i>: the prosecution of
the actio before the judex requires a separate
discussion. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Judex">Judex</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Actor">ACTOR, signified generally a plaintiff. In
a civil or private action, the plaintiff was
often called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitor</i>; in a public action (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa
publica</i>), he was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accusator</i>. The defendant
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reus</i>, both in private and
public causes: this term, however, according
to Cicero, might signify either party, as indeed
we might conclude from the word itself.
In a private action the defendant was often
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adversarius</i>, but either party might be
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adversarius</i> with respect to the other.
Wards brought their actions by their guardian
or tutor. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peregrini</i>, or aliens, originally
brought their action through their patronus;
but afterwards in their own name, by a fiction
of law, that they were Roman citizens.
A Roman citizen might also generally bring
his action by means of a cognitor or procurator.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Actio">Actio</a>.</span>] Actor has also the sense of
an agent or manager of another’s business
generally. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actor publicus</i> was an officer
who had the superintendence or care of
slaves and property belonging to the state.</p>


<p id="Actuariae">ACTŬĀRĬAE NĀVES, transport-vessels,
seem to have been built in a lighter style
than the ordinary ships of burden, from which
they also differed in being always furnished
with oars, whereas the others were chiefly
propelled by sails.</p>


<p id="Actuarii">ACTŬĀRĬI, short-hand writers, who took
down the speeches in the senate and the public
assemblies. In the debate in the Roman
senate upon the punishment of those who had
been concerned in the conspiracy of Catiline,
we find the first mention of short-hand
writers, who were employed by Cicero to
take down the speech of Cato.</p>


<p id="Actus">ACTUS, a Roman measure of length, also
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actus quadratus</i>, was equal to half a
jugerum, or 14,400 square Roman feet. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actus minimus</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">simplex</i>, was 120 feet long,
and four broad, and therefore equal to 480
square Roman feet. Actus was also used to
signify a bridle-way.</p>


<p id="Acus">ĂCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βελόνη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βελονίς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥαφίς</span>), a needle, a
pin. Pins were made not only of metal, but
also of wood, bone, and ivory. They were
used for the same purposes as with us, and
also in dressing the hair. The mode of platting
the hair, and then fastening it with a
pin or needle, is shown in the annexed figure
of a female head. This fashion has been
continued to our own times by the females of
Italy.</p>

They were usually freedmen.</p>


<p id="Adolescens">ĂDŎLESCENS, was applied in the Roman
law to a person from the end of his twelfth
or fourteenth to the end of his twenty-fifth
year, during which period a person was also
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adultus</i>. The word adolescens, however,
is frequently used in a less strict sense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
in the Latin writers in referring to a person
much older than the above-mentioned age.</p>


<p id="Adonia">ĂDŌNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδώνια</span>), a festival celebrated in
honour of Aphrodite and Adonis in most of
the Grecian cities. It lasted two days, and
was celebrated by women exclusively. On
the first day they brought into the streets
statues of Adonis, which were laid out as
corpses; and they observed all the rites customary
at funerals, beating themselves and
uttering lamentations. The second day was
spent in merriment and feasting; because
Adonis was allowed to return to life, and
spend half the year with Aphrodite.</p>


<p id="Adoptio">ĂDOPTĬO, adoption. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>&mdash;Adoption
was called by the Athenians <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσποίησις</span>,
or sometimes simply <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποίησις</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέσις</span>. The
adoptive father was said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποιεῖσθαι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσποιεῖσθαι</span>,
or sometimes <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποιεῖν</span>: and the father or
mother (for a mother after the death of her
husband could consent to her son being
adopted) was said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκποιεῖν</span>: the son was said
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκποιεῖσθαι</span> with reference to the family which
he left; and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσποιεῖσθαι</span> with reference to
the family into which he was received. The
son, when adopted, was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποιητός</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσποιητός</span>,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θετός</span>, in opposition to the legitimate
son born of the body of the father, who was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γνήσιος</span>. A man might adopt a son
either in his lifetime or by his testament,
provided he had no male offspring, and was
of sound mind. He might also, by testament,
name a person to take his property, in
case his son or sons should die under age.
Only Athenian citizens could be adopted;
but females could be adopted (by testament
at least) as well as males. The adopted child
was transferred from his own family and
demus into those of the adoptive father; he
inherited his property, and maintained the
sacra of his adoptive father. It was not necessary
for him to take his new father’s name,
but he was registered as his son in the register
of his phratria (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φρατρικὸν γραμματεῖον</span>).
Subsequently to this, it was necessary to enter
him in the register of the adoptive father’s
demus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ληξιαρχικὸν γραμματεῖον</span>), without
which registration it appears that he did not
possess the full rights of citizenship as a
member of his new demus.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span>&mdash;The
Roman relation of parent and child arose
either from a lawful marriage or from adoption.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adoptio</i> was the general name which
comprehended the two species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adoptio</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adrogatio</i>; and as the adopted person passed
from his own familia into that of the person
adopting, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adoptio</i> caused a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capitis diminutio</i>,
and the lowest of the three kinds. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Caput">Caput</a>.</span>]
Adoption, in its specific sense, was the ceremony
by which a person who was in the
power of his parent (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in potestate parentum</i>),
whether child or grandchild, male or female,
was transferred to the power of the person
adopting him. It was effected under the
authority of a magistrate (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magistratus</i>), the
praetor, for instance, at Rome, or a governor
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praeses</i>) in the provinces. The person to
be adopted was emancipated [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mancipatio">Mancipatio</a></span>]
by his natural father before the competent
authority, and surrendered to the adoptive
father by the legal form called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jure cessio</i>.
When a person was not in the power of his
parent (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</i>), the ceremony of adoption
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adrogatio</i>. Originally, it could
only be effected at Rome, and only by a vote
of the populus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">populi auctoritate</i>) in the
comitia curiata (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lege curiata</i>); the reason of
this being that the caput or status of a Roman
citizen could not, according to the laws
of the Twelve Tables, be effected except by a
vote of the populus in the comitia curiata.
Clodius, the enemy of Cicero, was adrogated
into a plebeian family, in order to qualify
himself to be elected a tribune of the plebs.
Females could not be adopted by adrogatio.
Under the emperors it became the practice to
effect the adrogatio by an imperial rescript.
The effect of adoption was to create the legal
relation of father and son, just as if the
adopted son were born of the blood of the
adoptive father in lawful marriage. The
adopted child was intitled to the name and
sacra privata of the adopting parent. A person,
on passing from one gens into another,
and taking the name of his new familia, generally
retained the name of his old gens also,
with the addition to it of the termination
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anus</i>. Thus Aemilius, the son of L. Aemilius
Paullus, upon being adopted by P. Cornelius
Scipio, assumed the name of P. Cornelius
Scipio Aemilianus, and C. Octavius, afterwards
the emperor Augustus, upon being
adopted by the testament of his great-uncle
the dictator, assumed the name of C. Julius
Caesar Octavianus.</p>


<p id="Adoratio">ĂDŌRĀTĬO (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσκύνησις</span>), adoration, was
paid to the gods in the following manner:&mdash;The
individual stretched out his right hand
to the statue of the god whom he wished to
honour, then kissed his hand, and waved it
to the statue. The adoratio differed from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oratio</i> or prayers, which were offered with
the hands folded together and stretched out to
the gods. The adoration paid to the Roman
emperors was borrowed from the Eastern mode,
and consisted in prostration on the ground,
and kissing the feet and knees of the emperor.</p>


<p id="Adrogatio">ADRŎGĀTĬO. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Adoptio">Adoptio</a></span>, (<span class="smcap">Roman</span>).]</p>


<p id="Adulterium">ĂDULTĔRĬUM, adultery. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>&mdash;Among
the Athenians, if a man caught another
man in the act of criminal intercourse
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοιχεία</span>) with his wife, he might kill him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
with impunity; and the law was also the
same with respect to a concubine (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλλακή</span>).
He might also inflict other punishment on
the offender. It appears that there was no
adultery, unless a married woman was concerned.
The husband might, if he pleased,
take a sum of money from the adulterer, by
way of compensation, and detain him till he
found sureties for the payment. The husband
might also prosecute the adulterer in the action
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοιχείας γραφή</span>. If the act of adultery
was proved, the husband could no longer
cohabit with his wife, under pain of losing
his privileges of a citizen (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</span>). The adulteress
was excluded even from those temples
which foreign women and slaves were allowed
to enter; and if she was seen there, any one
might treat her as he pleased, provided he did
not kill her or mutilate her.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span>&mdash;The
word adulterium properly signifies, in
the Roman law, the offence committed by a
man’s having sexual intercourse with another
man’s wife. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stuprum</i> (called by the Greeks
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φθορά</span>) signifies the like offence with a widow
or virgin. In the time of Augustus a law was
enacted (probably about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 17), entitled
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis</i>, which
seems to have contained special penal provisions
against adultery; and it is also not improbable
that, by the old law or custom, if
the adulterer was caught in the fact, he was
at the mercy of the injured husband, and that
the husband might punish with death his
adulterous wife. By the Julian law, a woman
convicted of adultery was mulcted in half of
her dowry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dos</i>) and the third part of her
property (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona</i>), and banished (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relegata</i>) to
some miserable island, such as Seriphos, for
instance. The adulterer was mulcted in half
his property, and banished in like manner.
This law did not inflict the punishment of
death on either party; and in those instances
under the emperors in which death was inflicted,
it must be considered as an extraordinary
punishment, and beyond the provisions
of the Julian law. The Julian law permitted
the father (both adoptive and natural) to kill
the adulterer and adulteress in certain cases,
as to which there were several nice distinctions
established by the law. If the wife was divorced
for adultery, the husband was entitled
to retain part of the dowry. By a constitution
of the Emperor Constantine, the offence
in the adulterer was made capital.</p>


<p id="Adversaria">ADVERSĀRĬA, a note-book, memorandum-book,
posting-book, in which the Romans entered
memoranda of any importance, especially
of money received and expended, which
were afterwards transcribed, usually every
month, into a kind of ledger. (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabulae justae,

<p id="Adunati">ĂDŬNĂTI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδύνατοι</span>), were persons supported
by the Athenian state, who, on account
of infirmity or bodily defects, were unable to
obtain a livelihood. The sum which they
received from the state appears to have varied
at different times. In the time of Lysias and
Aristotle, one obolus a day was given; but it
appears to have been afterwards increased
to two oboli. The bounty was restricted to
persons whose property was under three
minae; and the examination of those who
were entitled to it belonged to the senate of
the Five Hundred. Peisistratus is said to
have been the first to introduce a law for the
maintenance of those persons who had been
mutilated in war.</p>


<p id="Advocatus">ADVOCATUS, seems originally to have
signified any person who gave another his
aid in any affair or business, as a witness for
instance; or for the purpose of aiding and
protecting him in taking possession of a piece
of property. It was also used to express a
person who in any way gave his advice and
aid to another in the management of a cause;
but, in the time of Cicero, the word did not
signify the orator or patronus who made the
speech. Under the emperors it signified a
person who in any way assisted in the conduct
of a cause, and was sometimes equivalent
to orator. The advocate’s fee was then
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Honorarium</i>.</p>

<p id="Aedes">AEDES. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Domus">Domus</a>; Templum.</span>]</p>

<p id="Aediles">AEDĪLES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγορανόμοι</span>). The name of
these functionaries is said to be derived from
their having the care of the temple (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aedes</i>) of
Ceres. The aediles were originally two in
number: they were elected from the plebs,
and the institution of the office dates from
the same time as that of the tribunes of the
plebs, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 494. Their duties at first seem
to have been merely ministerial; they were
the assistants of the tribunes in such matters
as the tribunes entrusted to them, among
which are enumerated the hearing of causes
of smaller importance. At an early period
after their institution (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 446), we find
them appointed the keepers of the senatus-consulta,
which the consuls had hitherto
arbitrarily suppressed or altered. They were
also the keepers of the plebiscita. Other
functions were gradually entrusted to them,
and it is not always easy to distinguish their
duties from some of those which belong to
the censors. They had the general superintendence
of buildings, both sacred and private;
under this power they provided for
the support and repair of temples, curiae,
&amp;c., and took care that private buildings
which were in a ruinous state were repaired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
by the owners or pulled down. The care of
the supply and distribution of water, of the
streets and pavements, with the cleansing
and draining of the city, belonged to the
aediles; and, of course, the care of the cloacae.
They had the office of distributing
corn among the plebs, but this distribution
of corn at Rome must not be confounded with
the duty of purchasing or procuring it from
foreign parts, which was performed by the
consuls, quaestors, and praetors, and sometimes
by an extraordinary magistrate, as the
praefectus annonae. The aediles had to see
that the public lands were not improperly
used, and that the pasture grounds of the
state were not trespassed on; and they had
power to punish by fine any unlawful act in
this respect. They had a general superintendence
over buying and selling, and, as a
consequence, the supervision of the markets,
of things exposed to sale, such as slaves, and
of weights and measures; from this part of
their duty is derived the name under which
the aediles are mentioned by the Greek writers
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγορανόμοι</span>). It was their business to
see that no new deities or religious rites were
introduced into the city, to look after the
observance of religious ceremonies, and the
celebrations of the ancient feasts and festivals.
The general superintendence of police comprehended
the duty of preserving order,
regard to decency, and the inspection of the
baths and houses of entertainment. The
aediles had various officers under them, as
praecones, scribae, and viatores. The <span class="smcap">Aediles
Curules</span>, who were also two in number, were
originally chosen only from the patricians,
afterwards alternately from the patricians and
the plebs, and at last indifferently from both.
The office of curule aediles was instituted
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 365, and, according to Livy, on the
occasion of the plebeian aediles refusing to
consent to celebrate the Ludi Maximi for the
space of four days instead of three; upon
which a senatus-consultum was passed, by
which two aediles were to be chosen from the
patricians. From this time four aediles, two
plebeian and two curule, were annually elected.
The distinctive honours of the curule aediles
were, the sella curulis, from whence their
title is derived, the toga praetexta, precedence
in speaking in the senate, and the jus imaginum.
Only the curule aediles had the jus
edicendi, or the right of promulgating edicta;
but the rules comprised in their edicta served
for the guidance of all the aediles. The
edicta of the curule aediles were founded on
their authority as superintendents of the markets,
and of buying and selling in general.
Accordingly, their edicts had mainly, or perhaps
solely, reference to the rules as to buying
and selling, and contracts for bargain and
sale. The persons both of the plebeian and
curule aediles were sacrosancti. It seems
that after the appointment of the curule
aediles, the functions formerly exercised by
the plebeian aediles were exercised, with some
few exceptions, by all the aediles indifferently.
Within five days after being elected, or entering
on office, they were required to determine
by lot, or by agreement among themselves,
what parts of the city each should
take under his superintendence; and each
aedile alone had the care of looking after the
paving and cleansing of the streets, and other
matters, it may be presumed, of the same
local character within his district. The other
duties of the office seem to have been exercised
by them jointly. In the superintendence of
the public festivals or solemnities, there was
a further distinction between the two sets of
aediles. Many of these festivals, such as
those of Flora and Ceres, were superintended
by either set of aediles indifferently; but the
plebeian games were under the superintendence
of the plebeian aediles, who had an allowance
of money for that purpose; and the fines
levied on the pecuarii, and others, seem to
have been appropriated to these among other
public purposes. The celebration of the
Ludi Magni or Romani, of the Ludi Scenici,
or dramatic representations, and the Ludi
Megalesii, belonged specially to the curule
aediles, and it was on such occasions that
they often incurred a prodigious expense,
with a view of pleasing the people, and
securing their votes in future elections. This
extravagant expenditure of the aediles arose
after the close of the second Punic war, and
increased with the opportunities which individuals
had of enriching themselves after the
Roman arms were carried into Greece, Africa,
and Spain. Even the prodigality of the emperors
hardly surpassed that of individual
curule aediles under the republic; such as C.
Julius Caesar, the dictator, P. Cornelius Lentulus
Spinther, and, above all, M. Aemilius
Scaurus, whose expenditure was not limited
to bare show, but comprehended objects of
public utility, as the reparation of walls,
dock-yards, ports, and aquaeducts. In B.C.
45, Julius Caesar caused two curule aediles
and four plebeian aediles to be elected; and
thenceforward, at least so long as the office of
aedile was of any importance, six aediles were
annually elected. The two new plebeian
aediles were called Cereales, and their duty
was to look after the supply of corn. Though
their office may not have been of any great
importance after the institution of a praefectus
annonae by Augustus, there is no doubt that
it existed for several centuries, and at least as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
late as the time of the emperor Gordian. The
aediles belonged to the class of the minores
magistratus. The plebeian aediles were originally
chosen at the comitia centuriata, but
afterwards at the comitia tributa, in which
comitia the curule aediles also were chosen.
It appears that until the lex annalis was
passed (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 180) a Roman citizen might be
a candidate for any office after completing his
twenty-seventh year. This law fixed the age
at which each office might be enjoyed, and it
seems that the age fixed for the aedileship
was thirty-six. The aediles existed under
the emperors; but their powers were gradually
diminished, and their functions exercised
by new officers created by the emperors.
After the battle of Actium, Augustus appointed
a Praefectus urbi, who exercised the general
police, which had formerly been one of the
duties of the aediles. Augustus also took
from the aediles, or exercised himself, the
office of superintending the religious rites,
and the banishing from the city of all foreign
ceremonials; he also assumed the superintendence
of the temples, and thus may be
said to have destroyed the aedileship by depriving
it of its old and original function.
The last recorded instance of the splendours
of the aedileship is the administration of
Agrippa, who volunteered to take the office,
and repaired all the public buildings and all
the roads at his own expense, without drawing
anything from the treasury. The aedileship
had, however, lost its true character
before this time. Agrippa had already been
consul before he accepted the office of aedile,
and his munificent expenditure in this nominal
office was the close of the splendour of
the aedileship. Augustus appointed the
curule aediles specially to the office of putting
out fires, and placed a body of 600 slaves at
their command; but the praefecti vigilum
afterwards performed this duty. They retained,
under the early emperors, a kind of
police, for the purpose of repressing open
licentiousness and disorder. The coloniae,
and the municipia of the later period, had
also their aediles, whose numbers and functions
varied in different places. They seem,
however, as to their powers and duties, to
have resembled the aediles of Rome. They
were chosen annually.</p>

were persons who took care of the temples,

appear to have lived in the temples, or near
them, and to have acted as ciceroni to those
persons who wished to see them. Subsequently
among the Greeks, the menial services
connected with this office were left to
slaves, and the persons called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neocori</i> became
priestly officers of high rank, who had the
chief superintendence of temples, their treasures,
and the sacred rites observed in them.</p>

<p id="Aegis">AEGIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰγίς</span>) signifies, literally, a goat-skin.
According to ancient mythology, the
aegis worn by Zeus was the hide of the goat
Amaltheia, which had suckled him in his
infancy. Homer always represents it as part
of the armour of Zeus, whom on this account
he distinguishes by the epithet <em>aegis-bearing</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰγίοχος</span>). He, however, asserts, that it was
borrowed on different occasions both by
Apollo and Athena. The aegis was connected
with the shield of Zeus, either serving as a
covering over it, or as a belt by which it was
suspended from the right shoulder. Homer
accordingly uses the word to denote not only
the goat-skin, which it properly signified, but
also the shield to which it belonged. The
aegis was adorned in a style corresponding to
the might and majesty of the father of the
gods. In the middle of it was fixed the
appalling Gorgon’s head, and its border was
surrounded with golden tassels (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύσανοι</span>), each
of which was worth a hecatomb. The aegis
is usually seen on the statues of Athena, in
which it is a sort of scarf falling obliquely
over the right shoulder, so as to pass round
the body under the left arm. The serpents
of the Gorgon’s head are transferred to the
border of the skin. (See the left-hand figure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
in the cut.) The later poets and artists
represent the aegis as a breast-plate covered
with metal in the form of scales. (See the
right-hand figure.)</p>


<p id="Aeneatores">AENĔĀTŌRES, were those who blew upon
wind instruments in the Roman army; namely,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buccinatores</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornicines</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tubicines</i>.
They were also employed in the public games.</p>


<p id="Aenigma">AENIGMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴνιγμα</span>), a riddle. It was an
ancient custom among the Greeks to amuse
themselves by proposing riddles at their symposia,
or drinking parties. Those who were
successful in solving them, received a prize,
which usually consisted of wreaths, cakes,
&amp;c., while those who were unsuccessful were
condemned to drink in one breath a certain
quantity of wine, sometimes mixed with salt
water. Those riddles which have come down
to us are mostly in hexameter verse. The Romans
seem to have been too serious to find any
great amusement in riddles.</p>


<p id="Aenum">AENUM, or ĂHĒNUM (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vas</i>), a brazen
vessel, used for boiling. The word is also
frequently used in the sense of a dyer’s copper;
and, as purple was the most celebrated
dye of antiquity, we find the expressions
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sidonium aënum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrium aënum</i>, &amp;c.</p>


<p id="Aeora">AEŌRA, or ĔŌRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰώρα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐώρα</span>), a festival
at Athens, accompanied with sacrifices and
banquets, whence it is sometimes called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὔδειπνος</span>. It was probably instituted in
honour of Icarius and his daughter Erigone.</p>


<p id="Aera">AERA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Chronologia">Chronologia</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Aerarii">AERĀRĬI, a class of Roman citizens, who
were not included in the thirty tribes instituted
by Servius Tullius. Although citizens,
they did not possess the suffragium, or right
of voting in the comitia. They were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cives
sine suffragio</i>. They also paid the tribute in
a different manner from the other citizens.
The Aerarians were chiefly artisans and freedmen.
The Caerites, or inhabitants of the
Etruscan town of Caere, who obtained the
franchise in early times, but without the
suffragium, were probably the first body of
aerarians. Any Roman citizen guilty of a
crime punishable by the censors, might be
degraded to the rank of an aerarian; so that
his civic rights were suspended, at least for
the time that he was an aerarian. All citizens
so degraded were classed among the
Caerites; whence we find the expressions
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aerarium facere</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in tabulas Caeritum referre</i>
used as synonymous. Persons who were
made <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infames</i> likewise became aerarians, for
they lost the jus honorum and the suffragium.
The aerarians had to pay a tributum pro
capite which was considerably higher than
that paid by the other citizens. They were
not allowed to serve in the legions.</p>

<p id="Aerarium">AERĀRĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ δημόσιον</span>), the public treasury
at Rome, and hence the public money
itself. After the banishment of the kings the
temple of Saturn was employed as the place
for keeping the public money, and it continued
to be so used till the later times of the
empire. Besides the public money and the
accounts connected with it, various other
things were preserved in the treasury; of
these the most important were:&mdash;1. The
standards of the legions. 2. The various
laws passed from time to time, engraven on
brazen tables. 3. The decrees of the senate,
which were entered there in books kept
for the purpose, though the original documents
were preserved in the temple of Ceres
under the custody of the aediles. 4. Various
other public documents, the reports and
despatches of all generals and governors of
provinces, the names of all foreign ambassadors
that came to Rome, &amp;c. Under the
republic the aerarium was divided into two
parts: the <em>common</em> treasury, in which were
deposited the regular taxes, and from which
were taken the sums of money needed for the
ordinary expenditure of the state; and the
<em>sacred</em> treasury (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aerarium sanctum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctius</i>),
which was never touched except in
cases of extreme peril. Both of these treasuries
were in the temple of Saturn, but in
distinct parts of the temple. The produce of
a tax of five per cent. (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vicesima</i>) upon the
value of every manumitted slave, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum vicesimarium</i>, was paid into the sacred
treasury, as well as a portion of the immense
wealth obtained by the Romans in their conquests
in the East. Under Augustus the
provinces and the administration of the
government were divided between the senate,
as the representative of the old Roman people,
and the Caesar: all the property of the former
continued to be called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aerarium</i>, and that of
the latter received the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiscus</i>. Augustus
also established a third treasury, to
provide for the pay and support of the army,
and this received the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aerarium militare</i>.
He also imposed several new taxes to be paid
into this aerarium. In the time of the republic,
the entire management of the revenues of the
state belonged to the senate; and under the
superintendence and control of the senate the
quaestors had the charge of the aerarium. In
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 28, Augustus deprived the quaestors of
the charge of the treasury and gave it to two
praefects, whom he allowed the senate to
choose from among the praetors at the end of
their year of office. Various other changes
were made with respect to the charge of the
aerarium, but it was eventually entrusted, in
the reign of Trajan, to praefects, who appear
to have held their office for two years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>


<p id="Aes">AES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκός</span>), properly signifies a compound
of copper and tin, corresponding to what we
call <em>bronze</em>. It is incorrect to translate it
<em>brass</em>, which is a combination of copper and
zinc, since all the specimens of ancient objects,
formed of the material called aes, are found
upon analysis to contain no zinc. The employment
of aes was very general among the
ancients; money, vases, and utensils of all
sorts, being made of it. All the most ancient
coins in Rome and the old Italian states were
made of aes, and hence money in general was
called by this name. For the same reason
we have <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes alienum</i>, meaning debt, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aera</i>
in the plural, pay to the soldiers. The Romans
had no other coinage except bronze
or copper (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes</i>), till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 269, five years
before the first Punic war, when silver was
first coined; gold was not coined till sixty-two
years after silver. The first coinage of
aes is usually attributed to Servius Tullius,
who is said to have stamped the money with
the image of cattle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecus</i>), whence it is called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecunia</i>. According to some accounts, it was
coined from the commencement of the city,
and we know that the old Italian states possessed
a bronze or copper coinage from the
earliest times. The first coinage was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">as</i>
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#As_c">As</a></span>], which originally was a pound weight;
but as in course of time the weight of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">as</i>
was reduced not only in Rome, but in the
other Italian states, and this reduction in
weight was not uniform in the different
states, it became usual in all bargains to pay
the asses according to their weight, and not
according to their nominal value. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes
grave</i> was not the old heavy coins as distinguished
from the lighter modern; but it signified
any number of copper coins reckoned
according to the old style, by weight. There
was, therefore, no occasion for the state to
suppress the circulation of the old copper
coins, since in all bargains the asses were not
reckoned by tale, but by weight.&mdash;Bronze or
copper (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκός</span>) was very little used by the
Greeks for money in early times. Silver was
originally the universal currency, and copper
appears to have been seldom coined till after
the time of Alexander the Great. The copper
coin was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chalcous</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκούς</span>). The
smallest silver coin at Athens was the quarter-obol,
and the chalcous was the half of that,
or the eighth of an obol. In later times, the
obol was coined of copper as well as silver.</p>


<p id="Aes_c">AES CIRCUMFORĀNĔUM, money borrowed
from the Roman bankers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">argentarii</i>),
who had shops in porticoes round the forum.</p>


<p id="Aes_e">AES ĔQUESTRE, AES HORDĔĀRĬUM,
and AES MĪLĬTĀRE, were the ancient terms
for the pay of the Roman soldiers, before the
regular <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stipendium</i> was introduced. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes
equestre</i> was the sum of money given for the
purchase of the horse of an eques; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes
hordearium</i>, the sum paid yearly for its keep,
in other words the pay of an eques; and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes militare</i>, the pay of a foot soldier. None
of this money seems to have been taken from
the public treasury, but to have been paid by
certain private persons, to whom this duty
was assigned by the state. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes hordearium</i>,
which amounted to 2000 asses, had
to be paid by single women (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viduae</i>, i.e.
both maidens and widows) and orphans
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">orbi</i>), provided they possessed a certain
amount of property. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes equestre</i>, which
amounted to 10,000 asses, was probably also
paid by the same class of persons. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes
militare</i>, the amount of which is not expressly
mentioned, had to be paid by the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</i>, and if not paid, the foot soldiers
had a right of distress against them.
It is generally assumed that these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni
aerarii</i> were magistrates connected with the
treasury, and that they were the assistants
of the quaestors; but there are good reasons
for believing that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</i> were
private persons, who were liable to the payment
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes militare</i>, and upon whose
property a distress might be levied, if the
money were not paid. They were probably
persons whose property was rated at a certain
sum in the census, and we may conjecture
that they obtained the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</i>
because they levied the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tributum</i>, which was
imposed for the purpose of paying the army,
and then paid it to the soldiers. These <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni
aerarii</i> were no longer needed when the
state took into its own hands the payment of
the troops; but they were revived in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 70,
as a distinct class in the commonwealth, by
the Lex Aurelia, which gave the judicia to the
senators, equites and tribuni aerarii.</p>


<p id="Aes_u">AES UXŌRĬUM, was a tax paid by men
who reached old age without having married.
It was first imposed by the censors in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 403.

<p id="Aesymnetes">AESYMNĒTES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰσυμνήτης</span>), a person who
was sometimes invested with unlimited power
in the Greek states. His power partook in
some degree of the nature both of kingly and
tyrannical authority; since he was appointed
legally, and did not usurp the government,
but at the same time was not bound by any
laws in his public administration. The office
was not hereditary, nor was it held for life;
but it only continued for a limited time, or
till some object was accomplished. Thus we
read that the inhabitants of Mytilene appointed
Pittacus aesymnetes, in order to prevent
the return of Alcaeus and the other
exiles. Dionysius compares it with the dictatorship
of Rome. In some states, such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Cyme and Chalcedon, it was the title borne
by the regular magistrates.</p>

<p id="Aetolicum">AETŌLĬCUM FOEDUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινὸν τῶν Αἰτώλων</span>),
the Aetolian league, appears as a powerful
political body soon after the death of
Alexander the Great, viz. during the Lamian
war against Antipater. The characteristic
difference between the Aetolian and Achaean
leagues was that the former originally consisted
of a confederacy of nations or tribes,
while the latter was a confederacy of towns.
The sovereign power of the confederacy was
vested in the general assemblies of all the
confederates (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοινὸν τῶν Αἰτώλων</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">concilium
Aetolorum</i>), and this assembly had the right
to discuss all questions respecting peace and
war, and to elect the great civil or military
officers of the league. The ordinary place of
meeting was Thermon, but on extraordinary
occasions assemblies were also held in other
towns belonging to the league, though they
were not situated in the country of Aetolia
Proper. The questions which were to be
brought before the assembly were sometimes
discussed previously by a committee, selected
from the great mass, and called Apocleti
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπόκλητοι</span>). The general assembly usually
met in the autumn, when the officers of the
league were elected. The highest among
them, as among those of the Achaean league,
bore the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Strategus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατηγός</span>), whose
office lasted only for one year. The strategus
had the right to convoke the assembly;
he presided in it, introduced the subjects for
deliberation, and levied the troops. The
officers next in rank to the strategus were
the hipparchus and the public scribe. The
political existence of the league was destroyed
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 189 by the treaty with Rome, and the
treachery of the Roman party among the
Aetolians themselves caused in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 167 five
hundred and fifty of the leading patriots to
be put to death, and those who survived the
massacre were carried to Rome as prisoners.</p>

<p id="Ager">ĂGER PUBLĬCUS, the public land, was
the land belonging to the Roman state. It
was a recognised principle among the Italian
nations that the territory of a conquered
people belonged to the conquerors. Accordingly,
the Romans were constantly acquiring
fresh territory by the conquest of the surrounding
people. The land thus acquired
was usually disposed of in the following way.
1. The land which was under cultivation was
either distributed among colonists, who were
sent to occupy it, or it was sold, or it was let
out to farm. 2. The land which was then
out of cultivation, and which, owing to war,
was by far the greater part, might be occupied
by any of the Roman citizens on the
payment of a portion of the yearly produce;
a tenth of the produce of arable land, and a
fifth of the produce of the land planted with
the vine, the olive, and other valuable trees.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
3. The land which had previously served as
the common pasture land of the conquered
state, or was suitable for the purpose,
continued to be used as pasture land by
the Roman citizens, who had, however, to
pay a certain sum of money for the cattle
which they turned upon it. The occupation
of the public land spoken of above under the
second head was always expressed by the
words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">possessio</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">possidere</i>, and the occupier
of the land was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">possessor</i>. The
land continued to be the property of the
state; and accordingly we must distinguish
between the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">possessio</i>, which merely
indicated the use or enjoyment of the land,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominium</i>, which expressed ownership,
and was applied to private land, of which a
man had the absolute ownership. The right
of occupying the public land belonged only
to citizens, and consequently only to the patricians
originally, as they were the state.
The plebeians were only subjects, and consequently
had no right to the property of the
state; but it is probable that they were permitted
to feed their cattle on the public
pasture lands. Even when the plebeians
became a separate estate by the constitution
of Servius Tullius, they still obtained no
right to share in the possession of the public
land, which continued to be the exclusive
privilege of the patricians; but as a compensation,
each individual plebeian received an
assignment of a certain quantity of the public
land as his own property. Henceforth the
possession of the public land was the privilege
of the patricians, and an assignment of a
portion of it the privilege of the plebeians.
As the state acquired new lands by conquest,
the plebeians ought to have received assignments
of part of them, but since the patricians
were the governing body, they generally
refused to make any such assignment, and
continued to keep the whole as part of the
ager publicus, whereby the enjoyment of it
belonged to them alone. Hence, we constantly
read of the plebeians claiming, and
sometimes enforcing, a division of such land.
With the extension of the conquests of Rome,
the ager publicus constantly increased, and
thus a large portion of Italy fell into the
hands of the patricians, who frequently withheld
from the state the annual payments of a
tenth and a fifth, which they were bound to
pay for the possession of the land, and thus
deprived the state of a fund for the expenses
of the war. In addition to which they used
slaves as cultivators and shepherds, since
freemen were liable to be drawn off from
field-labour to military service, and slave-labour
was consequently far cheaper. In this
way the number of free labourers was diminished,
and that of slaves augmented. To
remedy this state of things several laws were
from time to time proposed and carried,
which were most violently opposed by the
patricians. All laws which related to the
<em>public</em> land are called by the general title of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Agrariae</i>, and accordingly all the early
laws relating to the possession of the public
land by the patricians, and to the assignment
of portions of it to the plebeians, were
strictly agrarian laws; but the first law to
which this name is usually applied was proposed
soon after the establishment of the
republic by the consul, Sp. Cassius, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
486. Its object was to set apart the portion
of the public land which the patricians were
to possess, to divide the rest among the plebeians,
to levy the payment due for the possession,
and to apply it to paying the army.
The first law, however, which really deprived
the patricians of the advantages they had
previously enjoyed in the occupation of the
public land was the agrarian law of C. Licinius
Stolo (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 366), which limited each
individual’s possession of public land to 500
jugera, and declared that no individual should
have above 100 large and 500 smaller cattle
on the public pastures: it further enacted
that the surplus land was to be divided
among the plebeians. As this law, however,
was soon disregarded, it was revived again
by Tib. Sempronius Gracchus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 133), with
some alterations and additions. The details
of the other agrarian laws mentioned in
Roman history are given under the name of
the lex by which they are called. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lex">Lex</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Agger">AGGER (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χῶμα</span>), from <em>ad</em> and <em>gero</em>, was
used in general for a heap or mound of any
kind. It was more particularly applied:&mdash;(1)
To a mound, usually composed of earth,
which was raised round a besieged town, and
which was gradually increased in breadth
and height, till it equalled or overtopped the
walls. The agger was sometimes made, not
only of earth, but of wood, hurdles, &amp;c.;
whence we read of the agger being set on
fire.&mdash;(2) To the earthen wall surrounding a
Roman encampment, composed of the earth
dug from the ditch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fossa</i>), which was usually
9 feet broad and 7 feet deep; but if any
attack was apprehended, the depth was increased
to 12 feet and the breadth to 13 feet.
Sharp stakes, &amp;c., were usually fixed upon
the agger, which was then called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallum</i>.
When both words are used, the agger means
the mound of earth, and the vallum the
stakes, &amp;c., which were fixed upon the agger.</p>

<p id="Agonalia">ĂGŌNĀLĬA or ĂGŌNĬA, one of the most
ancient festivals at Rome, its institution
being attributed to Numa Pompilius. It was
celebrated on the 9th of January, the 21st of
May, and the 11th of December; to which
we should probably add the 17th of March,
the day on which the Liberalia was celebrated,
since this festival is also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonia</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonium Martiale</i>. The object of this
festival was a disputed point among the ancients
themselves. The victim which was
offered was a ram; the person who offered it
was the rex sacrificulus; and the place where
it was offered was the regia. Now the ram
was the usual victim presented to the guardian
gods of the state, and the rex sacrificulus
and the regia could be employed only
for such ceremonies as were connected with
the highest gods and affected the weal of the
whole state. Regarding the sacrifice in this
light, we see a reason for its being offered
several times in the year. The etymology of
the name was also a subject of much dispute
among the ancients; and the various etymologies
that were proposed are given at
length by Ovid (<cite>Fast.</cite> i. 319-332). None of
these, however, are at all satisfactory; and we
would therefore suggest that it may have received
its name from the sacrifice having been
offered on the Quirinal hill, which was originally
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonus</i>.</p>


<p id="Agones">ĂGŌNES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγῶνες</span>), the general term among
the Greeks for the contests at their great
national games. The word also signified law-suits,
and was especially employed in the
phrase <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγῶνες τιμητοί</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτίμητοι</span>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Timema">Timema</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Agonothetae">ĂGONŎTHĔTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγωνοθέται</span>), persons in
the Grecian games who decided disputes, and
adjudged the prizes to the victors. Originally,
the person who instituted the contest
and offered the prize was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonothetes</i>,
and this continued to be the practice in those
games which were instituted by kings or
private persons. But in the great public
games, such as the Isthmian, Pythian, &amp;c.,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonothetae</i> were either the representatives
of different states, as the Amphictyons
at the Pythian games, or were chosen from
the people in whose country the games were
celebrated. During the flourishing times of
the Grecian republics the Eleans were the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonothetae</i> in the Olympic games, the Corinthians
in the Isthmian games, the Amphictyons
in the Pythian games, and the Corinthians,
Argives, and inhabitants of Cleonae
in the Nemaean games. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonothetae</i>
were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aesymnetae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰσυμνῆται</span>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonarchae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγωνάρχαι</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agonodicae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγωνοδίκαι</span>),

the staff which they carried as an emblem of
authority), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brabeis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βραβεῖς</span>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brabeutae</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βραβευταί</span>).</p>


<p id="Agora">ĂGŎRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγορά</span>) properly means an assembly
of any kind, and is usually employed
by Homer to designate the general assembly
of the people. The Agora seems to have been
considered an essential part of the constitution
of the early Grecian states. It was usually
convoked by the king, but occasionally by
some distinguished chieftain, as, for example,
by Achilles before Troy. The king occupied
the most important seat in these assemblies,
and near him sat the nobles, while the people
stood or sat in a circle around them. The
people appear to have had no right of speaking
or voting in these assemblies, but merely
to have been called together to hear what had
been already agreed upon in the council of
the nobles, and to express their feelings as a
body. The council of the nobles is called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Boulé</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλή</span>) and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thoöcus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θόωκος</span>), and sometimes
even <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agora</i>. Among the Athenians,
the proper name for the assembly of the
people was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecclesia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</span>), and among
the Dorians <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Halia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁλία</span>). The term Agora
was confined at Athens to the assemblies of
the phylae and demi. The name Agora was
early transferred from the assembly itself to
the place in which it was held; and thus it
came to be used for the market-place, where
goods of all descriptions were bought and
sold. Hence it answers to the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forum</i>.</p>


<p id="Agoranomi">ĂGŎRĀNŎMI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγορανόμοι</span>), public functionaries
in most of the Grecian states, whose
duties corresponded in many respects with
those of the Roman aediles. At Athens their
number was ten, five for the city, and five
for the Peiraeus, and they were chosen by
lot. The principal duty of the Agoranomi
was, as their name imports, to inspect the
market, and to see that all the laws respecting
its regulation were properly observed.
They had the inspection of all things that
were sold in the market, with the exception
of corn, which was subject to the jurisdiction
of special officers, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitophylaces</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτοφύλακες</span>).
They regulated the price and quantity
of articles exposed for sale, and punished
all persons convicted of cheating,
especially by means of false weights and
measures. They had the power of fining all
citizens who infringed upon the rules of the
market, and of whipping all slaves and
foreigners guilty of a like offence. They also
collected the market dues, and had the care
of all the temples and fountains in the
market place.</p>

<p id="Agraulia">AGRAULĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγραύλια</span>) was a festival celebrated
by the Athenians in honour of Agraulos,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the daughter of Cecrops. It was perhaps
connected with the solemn oath, which all
Athenians, when they arrived at manhood
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφηβοι</span>), were obliged to take in the temple
of Agraulos, that they would fight for their
country, and always observe its laws.</p>


<p id="Agrimensores">AGRĪMENSŌRES, or “land surveyors,”
a college established under the Roman emperors.
Like the jurisconsults, they had regular
schools, and were paid handsome salaries by
the state. Their business was to measure
unassigned lands for the state, and ordinary
lands for the proprietors, and to fix and
maintain boundaries. Their writings on the
subject of their art were very numerous;
and we have still scientific treatises on the
law of boundaries, such as those by Frontinus
and Hyginus.</p>


<p id="Agrionia">AGRIŌNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγριώνια</span>), a festival which
was celebrated at Orchomenus, in Boeotia, in
honour of Dionysus, surnamed Agrionius. A
human being used originally to be sacrificed
at this festival, but this sacrifice seems to have
been avoided in later times. One instance,
however, occurred in the days of Plutarch.</p>


<p id="Agronomi">AGRONŎMI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγρονόμοι</span>), the country-police,
probably in Attica, whose duties corresponded

astynomi in the city, and who appear to
have performed nearly the same duties as the
hylori (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑλωροί</span>).</p>


<p id="Agroteras">AGRŎTĔRAS THŬSIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγροτέρας θυσία</span>),
a festival celebrated every year at Athens in
honour of Artemis, surnamed Agrotera (from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγρα</span>, the chase). It was solemnized on the
sixth of the month of Boëdromion, and consisted
of a sacrifice of 500 goats, which continued
to be offered in the time of Xenophon.
Its origin is thus related:&mdash;When the Persians
invaded Attica, the Athenians made a
vow to sacrifice to Artemis Agrotera as many
goats as there should be enemies slain at
Marathon. But as the number of enemies
slain was so great that an equal number of
goats could not be found at once, the Athenians
decreed that 500 should be sacrificed every year.</p>


<p id="Agyrtae">AGYRTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγύρται</span>), mendicant priests,
who were accustomed to travel through the

images they carried, either on their shoulders
or on beasts of burthen. They were, generally
speaking, persons of the lowest and

brought at Athens, before the court of the

who had struck a citizen. Any citizen
who had been thus insulted might proceed

<p id="Aithousa">AITHOUSA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴθουσα</span>), a word only used

portico exposed to the sun. From the passages
in which it occurs, it seems to denote a

<p id="Ala_a">ĀLA, ĀLĀRES, ĀLĀRĬI. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ala</i>, which literally
means <em>a wing</em>, was from the earliest
epochs employed to denote the wing of an
army, but in process of time was frequently
used in a restricted sense.&mdash;(1) When a
Roman army was composed of Roman citizens
exclusively, the flanks of the infantry
when drawn up in battle array were covered
on the right and left by the cavalry; and
hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ala</i> denoted the body of horse which
was attached to and served along with the
foot-soldiers of the legion.&mdash;(2) When, at a
later date, the Roman armies were composed
partly of Roman citizens and partly of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socii</i>,
either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latini</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Italici</i>, it became the practice
to marshal the Roman troops in the
centre of the battle line and the Socii upon
the wings. Hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ala</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alarii</i> denoted
the contingent furnished by the allies, both
horse and foot, and the two divisions were
distinguished as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dextera ala</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sinistra ala</i>.&mdash;(3)
When the whole of the inhabitants
of Italy had been admitted to the privileges
of Roman citizens the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alarii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cohortes
alariae</i> were transferred to the <em>foreign</em> troops
serving along with the Roman armies.&mdash;(4)
Lastly, under the empire, the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ala</i>
was applied to regiments of horse, raised it
would seem with very few exceptions in the
provinces, serving apart from the legions and
the cavalry of the legions.</p>


<p id="Alabarches">ĂLĂBARCHĒS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλαβάρχης</span>), the chief magistrate

<p id="Alabaster">ĂLĂBASTER or ĂLĂBASTRUM, a vessel
or pot used for containing perfumes, or rather
ointments, made of that species of marble
which mineralogists call <em>gypsum</em>, and which
is usually designated by the name of <em>alabaster</em>.
When varieties of colour occur in the
same stone, and are disposed in bands or
horizontal strata, it is often called onyx alabaster;
and when dispersed irregularly, as if
in clouds, it is distinguished as agate alabaster.
The term seems to have been employed
to denote vessels appropriated to these uses,
even when they were not made of the material
from which it is supposed they originally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
received their name. Thus Theocritus
speaks of golden alabastra. These vessels
were of a tapering shape, and very often had
a long narrow neck, which was sealed; so
that when Mary, the sister of Lazarus, is
said by St. Mark to break the alabaster box
of ointment for the purpose of anointing our
Saviour, it appears probable that she only
broke the extremity of the neck, which was
thus closed.</p>

on a legion of picked men, which he raised at
his own expense among the inhabitants of
Transalpine Gaul, about the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 55,
which he equipped and disciplined after the
Roman fashion, and on which he at a subsequent
period bestowed the freedom of the

applied from a plume upon the helmet,
resembling the “apex” of the bird in question,
or from the general shape and appearance
of the head-piece.</p>

<p id="Album">ALBUM, a tablet of any material on which
the praetor’s edicts, and the rules relating to
actions and interdicts, were written. The
tablet was put up in a public place, in order
that all the world might have notice of its
contents. According to some authorities, the
album was so called because it was either a
white material or a material whitened, and
of course the writing would be of a different
colour. According to other authorities, it
was so called because the writing was in
white letters. Probably the word album
originally meant any tablet containing anything
of a public nature. We know that it
was, in course of time, used to signify a list
of any public body; thus we find <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">album judicum</i>,
or the body out of which judices were
to be chosen [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Judex">Judex</a></span>], and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">album senatorium</i>,
or list of senators.</p>


<p id="Alea">ĀLĔA, gaming, or playing at a game of

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tesserae</i>, was generally understood, because
this was by far the most common game of
chance among the Romans. Gaming was
forbidden by the Roman laws, both during
the times of the republic and under the emperors,
but was tolerated in the month of
December at the Saturnalia, which was a
period of general relaxation; and old men
were allowed to amuse themselves in this
manner at all times.</p>

In the Roman republic the poorer citizens
were assisted by public distributions of corn,

[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Congiarium">Congiarium</a>.</span>] The Emperor Nerva was the
first who extended them to children, and Trajan
appointed them to be made every month,
both to orphans and to the children of poor
parents. The children who received them were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pueri et puellae alimentarii</i>, and also

<p id="Aliptae">ĂLIPTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλείπται</span>), among the Greeks,
were persons who anointed the bodies of the
athletae preparatory to their entering the
palaestra. The chief object of this anointing
was to close the pores of the body, in order
to prevent much perspiration, and the weakness
consequent thereon. The athleta was
again anointed after the contest, in order to
restore the tone of the strained muscles. He
then bathed, and had the dust, sweat, and
oil scraped off his body, by means of an instrument
similar to the strigil of the Romans,
and called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stlengis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στλεγγίς</span>), and afterwards
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">xystra</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξύστρα</span>). The aliptae took advantage
of the knowledge they necessarily acquired
of the state of the muscles of the athletae,
and their general strength or weakness of
body, to advise them as to their exercises
and mode of life. They were thus a kind of
medical trainers. Among the Romans the
aliptae were slaves who scrubbed and anointed
their masters in the baths. They, too, like
the Greek aliptae, appear to have attended to
their masters’ constitution and mode of life.
They were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unctores</i>. They used
in their operations a kind of scraper called
strigil, towels (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lintea</i>), a cruise of oil (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">guttus</i>),
which was usually of horn, a bottle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i>),
and a small vessel called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lenticula</i>.</p>

<p id="Ambitus">AMBĬTUS, which literally signifies “a
going about,” cannot, perhaps, be more nearly
expressed than by our word <em>canvassing</em>. After
the plebs had formed a distinct class at Rome,
and when the whole body of the citizens had
become very greatly increased, we frequently
read, in the Roman writers, of the great
efforts which it was necessary for candidates
to make in order to secure the votes of the
citizens. At Rome, as in every community
into which the element of popular election
enters, solicitation of votes, and open or
secret influence and bribery, were among the
means by which a candidate secured his election
to the offices of state. The following
are the principal terms occurring in the
Roman writers in relation to the canvassing
for the public offices:&mdash;A candidate was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitor</i>; and his opponent with reference to
him <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">competitor</i>. A candidate (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">candidatus</i>)
was so called from his appearing in the
public places, such as the fora and Campus
Martius, before his fellow-citizens, in a
whitened toga. On such occasions the candidate
was attended by his friends (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deductores</i>),
or followed by the poorer citizens
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sectatores</i>), who could in no other manner
show their good will or give their assistance.
The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">assiduitas</i> expressed both the continual
presence of the candidate at Rome and
his continual solicitations. The candidate,
in going his rounds or taking his walk, was
accompanied by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomenclator</i>, who gave him
the names of such persons as he might meet;
the candidate was thus enabled to address
them by their name, an indirect compliment,
which could not fail to be generally gratifying
to the electors. The candidate accompanied
his address with a shake of the hand (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prensatio</i>).
The term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">benignitas</i> comprehended
generally any kind of treating, as shows,
feasts, &amp;c. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ambitus</i>, which was the
object of several penal enactments, taken as
a generic term, comprehended the two species&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ambitus</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">largitiones</i> (bribery). <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liberalitas</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">benignitas</i> are opposed by Cicero,
as things allowable, to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ambitus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">largitio</i>,
as things illegal. Money was paid for votes;
and, in order to insure secrecy and secure
the elector, persons called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interpretes</i> were
employed to make the bargain, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sequestres</i> to
hold the money till it was to be paid, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divisores</i> to distribute it. The offence of
ambitus was a matter which belonged to the
judicia publica, and the enactments against
it were numerous. One of the earliest,
though not the earliest of all, the Lex Cornelia
Baebia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 181) was specially directed
against <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">largitiones</i>. Those convicted under
it were incapacitated from being candidates
for ten years. The Lex Cornelia Fulvia
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 159) punished the offence with exile.
The Lex Acilia Calpurnia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 67) imposed
a fine on the offending party, with exclusion
from the senate and all public offices. The
Lex Tullia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63), passed in the consulship
of Cicero, in addition to the penalty of the
Acilian law, inflicted ten years’ exsilium on
the offender; and, among other things, forbade
a person to exhibit gladiatorial shows
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gladiatores dare</i>) within any two years in
which he was a candidate, unless he was required
to do so, on a fixed day, by a testator’s
will. Two years afterwards the Lex Aufidia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
was proposed, but not passed; by which,
among other things, it was provided that, if
a candidate promised (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pronuntiavit</i>) money
to a tribe, and did not pay it, he should be
unpunished; but, if he did pay the money, he
should further pay to each tribe (annually?)
3000 sesterces as long as he lived. This
absurd proposal occasioned the witticism of
Cicero, who said that Clodius observed the
law by anticipation; for he promised, but did
not pay. The Lex Licinia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 55) was specially
directed against the offence of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sodalitium</i>,
or the wholesale bribery of a tribe by
gifts and treating; and another lex, passed
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 52) when Pompey was sole consul, had
for its object the establishment of a speedier
course of proceeding on trials for ambitus.
All these enactments failed in completely accomplishing
their object. That which no
law could suppress, so long as the old popular
forms retained any of their pristine vigour,
was accomplished by the imperial usurpation.
Caesar, when dictator, nominated some of
the candidates for public offices: as to the
consulship, he managed the appointments to
that office just as he pleased. The popular
forms of election were observed during the
time of Augustus. Tiberius transferred the
elections from the comitia to the senate, by
which the offence of ambitus, in its proper
sense, entirely disappeared. The trials for
ambitus were numerous in the time of the
republic. The oration of Cicero in defence
of L. Murena, who was charged with ambitus,
and that in defence of Cn. Plancius,
who was charged with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sodalitium</i>, are both
extant.</p>

<p id="Amictus">ĂMICTUS. The verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amicire</i> is commonly

to the putting on of the outer garment, the
pallium, laena, or toga (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον, φᾶρος</span>); the
latter, to the putting on of the inner garment,
the tunic (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χιτών</span>). In consequence of this
distinction, the verbal nouns <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amictus</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">indutus</i>, even without any further denomination
of the dress being added, indicate respectively
the outer and inner clothing. In
Greek <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amicire</i> is expressed by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιέννυσθαι</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμπέχεσθαι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιβάλλεσθαι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιβάλλεσθαι</span>: and

<p id="Amphictyones">AMPHICTỸŎNES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφικτύονες</span>). Institutions
called amphictyonic appear to have
existed in Greece from time immemorial.
They seem to have been originally associations
of neighbouring tribes, formed for the regulation
of mutual intercourse and the protection
of a common temple or sanctuary, at
which the representatives of the different
members met, both to transact business and
to celebrate religious rites and games. One
of these associations was of much greater
importance than all the rest, and was called,
by way of eminence, the <em>Amphictyonic League</em>
or <em>Council</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφικτυονία</span>). It differed from
other similar associations in having two places
of meeting, the sanctuaries of two divinities;
which were the temple of Demeter, in the
village of Anthela, near Thermopylae, where
the deputies met in autumn; and that of
Apollo, at Delphi, where they assembled in
spring. Its connexion with the latter place
not only contributed to its dignity, but also to
its permanence. Its early history is involved
in obscurity. Most of the ancients suppose
it to have been founded by Amphictyon, the
son of Deucalion and Pyrrha, from whom
they imagined that it derived its name: but
this opinion is destitute of all foundation, and
arose from the ancients assigning the establishment
of their institutions to some mythical
hero. There can be little doubt as to
the true etymology of the word. It was originally
written <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφικτίονες</span>, and consequently
signified those that dwelt around some particular
locality. Its institution, however, is
clearly of remote antiquity. It was originally
composed of twelve <em>tribes</em> (not cities or states,
it must be observed), each of which tribes
contained various independent cities or states.
We learn from Aeschines, that in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 343,
eleven of these tribes were as follows:&mdash;The
Thessalians, Boeotians (not Thebans only),
Dorians, Ionians, Perrhaebians, Magnetes,
Locrians, Oetaeans or Oenianians, Phthiots
or Achaeans of Phthia, Malians, and Phocians;
other lists leave us in doubt whether the
remaining tribe were the Dolopes or Delphians;
but as the Delphians could hardly be
called a distinct tribe, their nobles appearing
to have been Dorians, it seems probable that
the Dolopes were originally members, and
afterwards supplanted by the Delphians. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
the states belonging to each of these tribes
were on a footing of perfect equality. Thus
Sparta enjoyed no advantages over Dorium
and Cytinium, two small towns in Doris: and
Athens, an Ionic city, was on a par with Eretria
in Euboea, and Priene in Asia Minor,
two other Ionic cities. The ordinary council
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pylaea</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυλαία</span>), from its meeting
in the neighbourhood of Pylae (Thermopylae),
but the name was given to the session at
Delphi as well as to that at Thermopylae.
The council was composed of two classes of
representatives, one called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pylagorae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πυλαγόραι</span>),
and the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hieromnemones</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἱερομνήμονες</span>).
Athens sent three Pylagorae and
one Hieromnemon; of whom the former were
elected apparently for each session, and the
latter by lot, probably for a longer period.
Respecting the relative duties of the Pylagorae
and Hieromnemones we have little
information: the name of the latter implies
that they had a more immediate connection
with the temple. We are equally in the
dark respecting the numbers who sat in the
council and its mode of proceeding. It would
seem that all the deputies had seats in the
council, and took part in its deliberations;
but if it be true, as appears from Aeschines,
that each of the tribes had only two votes, it
is clear that all the deputies could not have
voted. In addition to the ordinary council,
there was an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ecclesia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</span>), or general
assembly, including not only the classes
above mentioned, but also those who had
joined in the sacrifices, and were consulting
the god. It was convened on extraordinary
occasions by the chairman of the council. Of
the duties of the Amphictyons nothing will
give us a clearer view than the oath they
took, which was as follows:&mdash;“They would
destroy no city of the Amphictyons, nor cut
off their streams in war or peace; and if any
should do so, they would march against him,
and destroy his cities; and should any pillage
the property of the god, or be privy to or
plan anything against what was in his temple
(at Delphi), they would take vengeance on
him with hand and foot, and voice, and all
their might.” From this oath we see that
the main duty of the deputies was the preservation
of the rights and dignity of the temple
of Delphi. We know, too, that after it was
burnt down (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 548), they contracted with
the Alcmaeonidae for its rebuilding. History,
moreover, teaches that if the council produced
any palpable effects, it was from their interest
in Delphi; and though they kept up a standing
record of what ought to have been the international
law of Greece, they sometimes acquiesced
in, and at other times were parties to, the most
iniquitous acts. Of this the case of Crissa
is an instance. This town lay on the Gulf of
Corinth, near Delphi, and was much frequented
by pilgrims from the West. The Crissaeans
were charged by the Delphians with undue
exactions from these strangers. The council
declared war against them, as guilty of a
wrong against the god. The war lasted ten
years, till, at the suggestion of Solon, the
waters of the Pleistus were turned off, then
poisoned, and turned again into the city. The
besieged drank their fill, and Crissa was soon
razed to the ground; and thus, if it were an
Amphictyonic city, was a solemn oath doubly
violated. Its territory&mdash;the rich Cirrhaean
plain&mdash;was consecrated to the god, and curses
imprecated upon whomsoever should till or
dwell in it. Thus ended the First Sacred
War (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 585), in which the Athenians were
the instruments of Delphian vengeance. The
second or Phocian war (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 350) was the
most important in which the Amphictyons
were concerned; and in this the Thebans
availed themselves of the sanction of the
council to take vengeance on their enemies,
the Phocians. To do this, however, it was
necessary to call in Philip of Macedon, who
readily proclaimed himself the champion of
Apollo, as it opened a pathway to his own
ambition. The Phocians were subdued (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
346), and the council decreed that all their
cities, except Abae, should be razed, and the
inhabitants dispersed in villages not containing
more than fifty persons. Their two votes
were given to Philip, who thereby gained a
pretext for interfering with the affairs of
Greece; and also obtained the recognition of
his subjects as Hellenes. The Third Sacred
War arose from the Amphissians tilling the
devoted Cirrhaean plain. The Amphictyons
called in the assistance of Philip, who soon
reduced the Amphissians to subjection. Their
submission was immediately followed by the
battle of Chaeroneia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 338), and the
extinction of the independence of Greece. In
the following year, a congress of the Amphictyonic
states was held, in which war was
declared as if by united Greece against Persia,
and Philip elected commander-in-chief. On
this occasion the Amphictyons assumed the
character of national representatives as of old,
when they set a price upon the head of Ephialtes,
for his treason to Greece at Thermopylae.
It has been sufficiently shown that
the Amphictyons themselves did not observe
the oaths they took; and that they did not
much alleviate the horrors of war, or enforce
what they had sworn to do, is proved by
many instances. Thus, for instance, Mycenae
was destroyed by Argos (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 535), Thespiae
and Plataeae by Thebes, and Thebes herself
swept from the face of the earth by Alexander,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
without the Amphictyons raising one word in
opposition. Indeed, a few years before the
Peloponnesian war, the council was a passive
spectator of what Thucydides calls the Sacred
War (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἱερὸς πόλεμος</span>), when the Lacedaemonians
made an expedition to Delphi, and put
the temple into the hands of the Delphians,
the Athenians, after their departure, restoring
it to the Phocians. The council is rarely
mentioned after the time of Philip. We are
told that Augustus wished his new city,
Nicopolis (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 31), to be enrolled among
the members. Pausanias, in the second
century of our era, mentions it as still existing,
but deprived of all power and influence.</p>


<p id="Amphidromia">AMPHĬDRŎMĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιδρόμια</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρομιάμφιον
ἧμαρ</span>), a family festival of the Athenians,
at which the newly-born child was
introduced into the family, and received its
name. The friends and relations of the
parents were invited to the festival of the
amphidromia, which was held in the evening,
and they generally appeared with presents.
The house was decorated on the outside with
olive branches when the child was a boy, or
with garlands of wool when the child was a
girl; and a repast was prepared for the
guests. The child was carried round the
fire by the nurse, and thus, as it were, presented
to the gods of the house and to the
family, and at the same time received its
name, to which the guests were witnesses.
The carrying of the child round the hearth
was the principal part of the solemnity, from
which its name was derived.</p>

<p id="Amphitheatrum">AMPHĬTHĔĀTRUM, an amphitheatre,
was a place for the exhibition of public shows
of combatants, wild beasts, and naval engagements,
and was entirely surrounded with
seats for the spectators; whereas, in those
for dramatic performances, the seats were
arranged in a semicircle facing the stage.
An amphitheatre is therefore frequently described
as a double theatre, consisting of two
such semicircles, or halves, joined together,
the spaces allotted to their orchestras becoming
the inner inclosure, or area, termed the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arena</i>. The form, however, of the ancient
amphitheatres was not a circle, but invariably
an ellipse. Gladiatorial shows and combats
of wild beasts (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venationes</i>) were first exhibited
in the forum and the circus; and it
appears that the ancient custom was still
preserved till the time of Julius Caesar. The
first building in the form of an amphitheatre
is said to have been erected by C. Scribonius
Curio, one of Caesar’s partisans; but the
account which is given of this building sounds
rather fabulous. It is said to have consisted
of two wooden theatres, made to revolve on
pivots, in such a manner that they could, by
means of windlasses and machinery, be turned
round face to face, so as to form one building.
Soon after Caesar himself erected, in the
Campus Martius, a stationary amphitheatre,
made of wood; to which building the name
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amphitheatrum</i> was for the first time given.
The first stone amphitheatre was built by
Statilius Taurus, in the Campus Martius, at
the desire of Augustus. This was the only
stone amphitheatre at Rome till the time of
Vespasian. One was commenced by Caligula,
but was not continued by Claudius. The one
erected by Nero in the Campus Martius was
only a temporary building, made of wood.
The amphitheatre of Statilius Taurus was
burnt in the fire of Rome in the time of Nero;
and hence, as a new one was needed, Vespasian
commenced the celebrated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amphitheatrum
Flavium</i> in the middle of the city, in the
valley between the Caelian, the Esquiline,
and the Velia, on the spot originally occupied
by the lake or large pond attached to Nero’s
palace. Vespasian did not live to finish it.
It was dedicated by Titus in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 80, but was
not completely finished, till the reign of Domitian.
This immense edifice, which is even yet
comparatively entire, covered nearly six acres
of ground, and was capable of containing
about 87,000 spectators. It is called at the
present day the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colosseum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colisaeum</i>. The
interior of an amphitheatre was divided into
three parts, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arena</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">podium</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gradus</i>.
The clear open space in the centre of the
amphitheatre was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arena</i>, because
it was covered with sand, or sawdust, to
prevent the gladiators from slipping, and to
absorb the blood. The size of the arena was
not always the same in proportion to the size
of the amphitheatre, but its average proportion
was one-third of the shorter diameter of
the building. The arena was surrounded by
a wall distinguished by the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">podium</i>;
although such appellation, perhaps, rather
belongs to merely the upper part of it, forming
the parapet, or balcony, before the first
or lowermost seats, nearest to the arena. The
arena, therefore, was no more than an open
oval court, surrounded by a wall about fifteen
feet high; a height considered necessary, in
order to render the spectators perfectly secure
from the attacks of wild beasts. There were
four principal entrances leading into the arena;
two at the ends of each axis or diameter of it,
to which as many passages led directly from
the exterior of the building; besides secondary
ones, intervening between them, and communicating
with the corridors beneath the seats
on the podium. The wall or enclosure of the
arena is supposed to have been faced with
marble, more or less sumptuous; besides
which, there appears to have been, in some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
instances at least, a sort of net-work affixed
to the top of the podium, consisting of railing,
or rather open trellis-work of metal. As
a further defence, ditches, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">euripi</i>, sometimes
surrounded the arena. The term podium
was also applied to the terrace, or gallery
itself, immediately above the arena, which
was no wider than to be capable of containing
two, or at the most, three ranges of moveable
seats, or chairs. This, as being by far the
best situation for distinctly viewing the sports
in the arena, and also more commodiously
accessible than the seats higher up, was the
place set apart for senators and other persons
of distinction, such as foreign ambassadors;
and it was here, also, that the emperor himself
used to sit, in an elevated place, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suggestus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubiculum</i>, and likewise the
person who exhibited the games on a place
elevated like a pulpit or tribunal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">editoris
tribunal</i>). Above the podium were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gradus</i>,
or seats of the other spectators, which
were divided into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maeniana</i>, or stories. The
first <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maenianum</i>, consisting of fourteen rows
of stone or marble seats, was appropriated
to the equestrian order. The seats appropriated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
to the senators and equites were
covered with cushions, which were first used
in the time of Caligula. Then, after an interval
or space, termed a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praecinctio</i>, and
forming a continued landing-place from the
several staircases in it, succeeded the second
maenianum, where were the seats called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popularia</i>, for the third class of spectators, or
the populus. Behind this was the second praecinctio,
bounded by a rather high wall; above
which was the third maenianum, where there
were only wooden benches for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pullati</i>, or
common people. The next and last division,
namely, that in the highest part of the
building, consisted of a colonnade, or gallery,
where females were allowed to witness the
spectacles of the amphitheatre, but some parts
of it were also occupied by the pullati.
Each maenianum was not only divided from
the other by the praecinctio, but was intersected
at intervals by spaces for passages left
between the seats, <span id="Scalae_a">called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalae</i></span>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaria</i>;
and the portion between two such passages
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cuneus</i>, because the space gradually
widened like a wedge, from the podium to
the top of the building. The entrances to
the seats from the outer porticoes were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vomitoria</i>. At the very summit was the
narrow platform for the men who had to
attend to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velarium</i>, or awning, by which
the building was covered as a defence against
the sun and rain. The velarium appears
usually to have been made of wool, but more
costly materials were sometimes employed.
The first of the preceding cuts represents a
longitudinal section of the Flavian amphitheatre,
and the second, which is on a larger
scale, a part of the above section, including
the exterior wall, and the seats included
between that and the arena. It will serve to
convey an idea of the leading form and general
disposition of the interior. For an account of

<p id="Amphora">AMPHŎRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφορεύς</span>), a vessel used for
holding wine, oil, honey, &amp;c. The following
cut represents amphorae in the British Museum.
They are of various forms and sizes;
in general they are tall and narrow, with a
small neck, and a handle on each side of the
neck (whence the name, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφί</span>, <em>on both
sides</em>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φέρω</span>, to carry), and terminating at
the bottom in a point, which was let into a
stand or stuck in the ground, so that the
vessel stood upright: several amphorae have
been found in this position in the cellars at
Pompeii. Amphorae were commonly made
of earthenware. Homer mentions amphorae
of gold and stone, and the Egyptians had
them of brass; glass vessels of this form
have been found at Pompeii. The most common
use of the amphora, both among the
Greeks and the Romans, was for keeping
wine. The cork was covered with pitch or
gypsum, and (among the Romans) on the
outside the title of the wine was painted, the
date of the vintage being marked by the
names of the consuls then in office; or, when
the jars were of glass, little tickets (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pittoria</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tesserae</i>) were suspended from them, indicating
these particulars.&mdash;The Greek amphoreus and
the Roman amphora were also names of fixed
measures. The amphoreus, which was also
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metretes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετρητής</span>) and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cadus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάδος</span>),
was equal to three Roman urnae = 8 gallons,
7·365 pints, imperial measure. The Roman
amphora was two-thirds of the amphoreus,
and was equal to 2 urnae = 8 congii = to 5
gallons, 7·577 pints; its solid content was
exactly a Roman cubic foot.</p>

Ampullae are frequently mentioned in connection

with him to the bath a bottle of oil for anointing
the body after bathing. The dealer in
bottles was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampullarius</i>.</p>

an amulet. This word in Arabic
(hamalet) means <em>that which is suspended</em>. It
was probably brought into Europe by Arabian
merchants, together with the articles to
which it was applied. An amulet was any
object,&mdash;a stone, a plant, an artificial production,
or a piece of writing,&mdash;which was
suspended from the neck, or tied to any part
of the body, for the purpose of warding off
calamities and securing advantages of any
kind. Faith in the virtues of amulets was

<p id="Anacrisis">ĂNACRĬSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκρισις</span>), an examination,
was used to signify the pleadings preparatory

to determine, generally, if the action would
lie. The magistrates were said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνακρίνειν

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνακρίνεσθαι</span>. The process consisted in the
production of proofs, of which there were
five kinds:&mdash;1. The laws; 2. Written documents;
3. Testimonies of witnesses present
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαρτυρίαι</span>), or affidavits of absent witnesses
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκμαρτυρίαι</span>); 4. Depositions of slaves extorted
by the rack; 5. The oath of the parties.
All these proofs were committed to
writing, and placed in a box secured by a
seal (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐχῖνος</span>) till they were produced at the
trial. If the evidence produced at the anacrisis
was so clear and convincing that there
could not remain any doubt, the magistrate
could decide the question without sending the
cause to be tried before the dicasts: this was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diamartyria</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαμαρτυρία</span>). The archons

<p id="Annulus">ANNŬLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δακτύλιος</span>), a ring. It is probable
that the custom of wearing rings was
very early introduced into Greece from Asia,
where it appears to have been almost universal.
They were worn not merely as ornaments,
but as articles for use, as the ring
always served as a seal. A seal was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sphragis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφραγίς</span>), and hence this name was
given to the ring itself, and also to the gem
or stone for a ring in which figures were engraved.
Rings in Greece were mostly worn
on the fourth finger (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παράμεσος</span>). At Rome,
the custom of wearing rings was believed to
have been introduced by the Sabines, who
were described in the early legends as wearing
golden rings with precious stones of great
beauty. But, whenever introduced at Rome,
it is certain that they were at first always of
iron; that they were destined for the same
purpose as in Greece, namely, to be used as
seals; and that every free Roman had a right
to use such a ring. This iron ring was worn
down to the last period of the republic by
such men as loved the simplicity of the good
old times. In the course of time, however,
it became customary for all the senators,
chief magistrates, and at last for the equites
also, to wear a golden seal-ring. The right
of wearing a gold ring, which was subsequently
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus annuli aurei</i>, or the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus annulorum</i>, remained for several centuries
at Rome the exclusive privilege of senators,
magistrates, and equites, while all other
persons continued to wear iron ones. During
the empire the right of granting the annulus
aureus belonged to the emperors, and some
of them were not very scrupulous in conferring
this privilege. Augustus gave it to
Mena, a freedman, and to Antonius Musa,
a physician. The emperors Severus and
Aurelian conferred the right of wearing
golden rings upon all Roman soldiers; and
Justinian at length allowed all the citizens of
the empire, whether ingenui or libertini, to
wear such rings. The ring of a Roman emperor
was a kind of state seal, and the emperor
sometimes allowed the use of it to such
persons as he wished to be regarded as his
representatives. During the republic and
the early times of the empire the jus annuli
seems to have made a person ingenuus (if he
was a libertus), and to have raised him to
the rank of eques, provided he had the requisite
equestrian census, and it was probably
never granted to any one who did not possess
this census. Those who lost their property,
or were found guilty of a criminal offence,
lost the jus annuli. The principal value of
a ring consisted in the gem set in it, or rather<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
in the workmanship of the engraver. The
stone most frequently used was the onyx
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαρδῶνος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαρδόνυξ</span>), on account of its various
colours, of which the artist made the most
skilful use. In the art of engraving upon
gems the ancients far surpassed anything
that modern times can boast of. The devices
engraved upon rings were very various:
they were portraits of ancestors or of friends,
subjects connected with mythology; and in
many cases a person had engraved upon his
seal some symbolical allusion to the real or
mythical history of his family. The bezel or
part of the ring which contained the gem
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pala</i>. With the increasing love of
luxury and show, the Romans, as well as the
Greeks, covered their fingers with rings.
Some persons also wore rings of immoderate
size, and others used different rings for summer
and winter. Much superstition appears
to have been connected with rings, especially
in the East and in Greece. Some persons
made it a lucrative trade to sell rings which
were believed to possess magic powers,

<p id="Anquisitio">ANQUĪSĪTĬO, signified, in criminal trials
at Rome, the investigation of the facts of the
case with reference to the penalty that was
to be imposed: accordingly the phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecunia
capitis</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capitis anquirere</i> are used.
Under the emperors the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anquisitio</i> lost
its original meaning, and was employed to
indicate an accusation in general; in which
sense it also occurs even in the times of the
republic.</p>

  <div class="caption">Temple in Antis. (Temple of Artemis at Eleusia.)</div>
</div>

<p id="Antae">ANTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραστάδες</span>), square pillars, which
were commonly joined to the side-walls of a
building, being placed on each side of the
door, so as to assist in forming the portico.
These terms are seldom found except in the
plural; because the purpose served by antae
required that they should be erected corresponding
to each other and supporting the
extremities of the same roof. The temple <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
antis</i> was one of the simplest kind. It had
in front antae attached to the walls which
inclosed the cella; and in the middle, between
the antae, two columns supporting the
architrave.</p>


<p id="Anteambulones">ANTĔAMBŬLŌNES, slaves who were accustomed
to go before their masters, in order
to make way for them through the crowd.
The term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anteambulones</i> was also given to
the clients, who were accustomed to walk
before their patroni, when the latter appeared
in public.</p>


<p id="Antecessores">ANTĔCESSŌRES, called also ANTĔCURSŌRES,
horse-soldiers, who were accustomed
to precede an army on march, in order to
choose a suitable place for the camp, and to
make the necessary provisions for the army.
They do not appear to have been merely
scouts, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">speculatores</i>.</p>


<p id="Antecoena">ANTĔCOENA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Coena">Coena</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Antefixa">ANTĔFIXA, terra-cottas, which exhibited
various ornamental designs, and were used
in architecture to cover the frieze (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">zophorus</i>)
of the entablature. These terra-cottas do not
appear to have been used among the Greeks,
but were probably Etruscan in their origin,
and were thence taken for the decoration of
Roman buildings. The name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">antefixa</i> is
evidently derived from the circumstance that
they were <em>fixed before</em> the buildings which
they adorned. Cato, the censor, complained
that the Romans of his time began to despise
ornaments of this description, and to prefer
the marble friezes of Athens and Corinth.
The rising taste which Cato deplored may
account for the superior beauty of the antefixa
preserved in the British Museum, which
were discovered at Rome.</p>

her mother in the beginning of spring.</p>

<p id="Antidosis">ANTĬDŎSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντίδοσις</span>), in its literal and
general meaning, “an exchange,” was, in
the language of the Attic courts, peculiarly
applied to proceedings under a law which is
said to have originated with Solon. By this,
a citizen nominated to perform a leiturgia,
such as a trierarchy or choregia, or to rank
among the property-tax payers, in a class
disproportioned to his means, was empowered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
to call upon any qualified person not so
charged to take the office in his stead, or
submit to a complete exchange of property,
the charge in question of course attaching to
the first party, if the exchange were finally
effected. For the proceedings the courts were
opened at a stated time every year by the
magistrates that had official cognisance of the
particular subject; such as the strategi in
cases of trierarchy and rating to the property-taxes,
and the archon in those of choregia.</p>


<p id="Antigraphe">ANTĬGRĂPHE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιγραφή</span>) originally signified
the writing put in by the defendant,
his “plea” in all causes whether public or
private, in answer to the indictment or bill
of the prosecutor. It is, however, also applied
to the bill or indictment of the plaintiff
or accuser.</p>


<p id="Antlia">ĀNTLĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄντλια</span>), any machine for raising
water, a pump. The most important of these
machines were:&mdash;(1) The tympanum; a
tread-wheel, worked by men treading on it.&mdash;(2)
A wheel having wooden boxes or buckets,
so arranged as to form steps for those who
trod the wheel.&mdash;(3) The chain pump.&mdash;(4)
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cochlea</i>, or Archimedes’s screw.&mdash;(5) The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ctesibica machina</i>, or forcing-pump.&mdash;Criminals
were condemned to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">antlia</i> or
tread-mill. The antlia with which Martial
(ix. 19) watered his garden, was probably the
pole and bucket universally employed in
Italy, Greece, and Egypt. The pole is curved,
as shown in the annexed figure; because
it is the stem of a fir or some other tapering
tree.</p>

<p id="Antyx">ANTYX (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄντυξ</span>), the rim or border of any
thing, especially of a shield or chariot. The
rim of the large round shield of the ancient
Greeks was thinner than the part which it
enclosed; but on the other hand, the antyx
of a chariot must have been thicker than the
body to which it gave both form and strength.
In front of the chariot the antyx was often
raised above the body, into the form of a
curvature, which served the purpose of a
hook to hang the reins upon.</p>

<p id="Apagoge">ĂPĂGŌGĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπαγωγή</span>), a summary process,
allowed in certain cases by the Athenian law.
The term denotes not merely the act of apprehending
a culprit caught <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in ipso facto</i>, but
also the written information delivered to the
magistrate, urging his apprehension. The
cases in which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apagoge</i> was most generally
allowed were those of theft, murder,
ill-usage of parents, &amp;c.</p>


<p id="Apaturia">ĂPĂTŪRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπατούρια</span>) was a political
festival, which the Athenians had in common
with all the Greeks of the Ionian name, with
the exception of those of Colophon and
Ephesus. It was celebrated in the month of
Pyanepsion, and lasted for three days. The
name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπατούρια</span> is not derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπατᾶν</span>,
to deceive, but is composed of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀ = ἅμα</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πατύρια</span>, which is perfectly consistent with
what Xenophon says of the festival, that
when it is celebrated the fathers and relations
assemble together. According to this
derivation, it is the festival at which the
phratriae met to discuss and settle their own
affairs. But, as every citizen was a member
of a phratria, the festival extended over the
whole nation, who assembled <em>according to
phratriae</em>. The festival lasted three days.
The third day was the most important; for
on that day, children born in that year, in
the families of the phratriae, or such as were
not yet registered, were taken by their fathers,
or in their absence by their representatives
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύριοι</span>), before the assembled
members of the phratria. For every child a
sheep or a goat was sacrificed. The father,
or he who supplied his place, was obliged to
establish by oath that the child was the offspring
of free-born parents, and citizens of
Athens. After the victim was sacrificed, the
phratores gave their votes, which they took
from the altar of Zeus Phratrius. When the
majority voted against the reception, the
cause might be tried before one of the courts
of Athens; and if the claims of the child
were found unobjectionable, its name, as well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
as that of the father, was entered into the
register of the phratria, and those who had
wished to effect the exclusion of the child
were liable to be punished.</p>


<p id="Aperta">ĂPERTA NĀVIS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Navis">Navis</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Apex">ĂPEX, a cap worn by the flamines and
salii at Rome. The essential part of the
apex, to which alone the name properly belonged,
was a pointed piece of olive-wood,
the base of which was surrounded with a
lock of wool. This was worn on the top of
the head, and was held there either by fillets
only, or, as was more commonly the case, by
the aid of a cap which fitted the head, and
was also fastened by means of two strings or
bands. The albogalerus, a white cap made
of the skin of a white victim sacrificed to
Jupiter, and worn by the flamen dialis, had the
apex fastened to it by means of an olive twig.</p>

<p id="Apodectae">ĂPODECTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποδέκται</span>), public officers

in the place of the ancient colacretae (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κωλακρέται</span>).
They were ten in number, one for

<p id="Apographe">ĂPŎGRĂPHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπογραφή</span>), literally, “a

when there were several defendants. It
differed but little, if at all, from the ordinary
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">graphe</i>.&mdash;(2) A solemn protest or assertion
in writing before a magistrate, to the intent
that it might be preserved by him till it was
required to be given in evidence.&mdash;(3) A
specification of property, said to belong to
the state, but actually in the possession of a
private person; which specification was made
with a view to the confiscation of such property
to the state.</p>

<p id="Apollonia">ĂPOLLŌNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπολλώνια</span>), the name of a

honour of Apollo and Artemis.</p>


<p id="Apophoreta">ĂPŎPHŎRĒTA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποφόρητα</span>) were presents,
which were given to friends at the end of an

Saturnalia.</p>


<p id="Aporrheta">ĂPORRHĒTA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπόῤῥητα</span>), literally “things
forbidden,” has two peculiar, but widely different,
acceptations in the Attic dialect. In
one of these it implies contraband goods; in
the other, it denotes certain contumelious
epithets, from the application of which both
the living and the dead were protected by
special laws.</p>


<p id="Apostoleus">ĂPŎSTŎLEUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποστολεύς</span>), the name of a
public officer at Athens. There were ten
magistrates of this name, and their duty was
to see that the ships were properly equipped
and provided by those who were bound to
discharge the trierarchy. They had the
power, in certain cases, of imprisoning the
trierarchs who neglected to furnish the ships
properly.</p>


<p id="Apotheca">ĂPŎTHĒCA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποθήκη</span>), a place in the
upper part of the house, in which the Romans
frequently placed the earthen amphorae
in which their wines were deposited. This
place, which was quite different from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella vinaria</i>, was above the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fumarium</i>; since
it was thought that the passage of the smoke
through the room tended greatly to increase
the flavour of the wine. The position of the
apotheca explains the expression in Horace
(<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carm.</cite> ii. 21, 7), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Descende</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testa</i>.</p>


<p id="Apotheosis">ĂPŎTHĔŌSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποθέωσις</span>), the enrolment
of a mortal among the gods. The mythology
of Greece contains numerous instances of the
deification of mortals; but in the republican
times of Greece we find few examples of such
deification. The inhabitants of Amphipolis,
however, offered sacrifices to Brasidas after
his death. In the Greek kingdoms, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
arose in the East on the dismemberment of
the empire of Alexander, it appears to have
been not uncommon for the successor to the
throne to offer divine honours to the former
sovereign. Such an apotheosis of Ptolemy,
king of Egypt, is described by Theocritus in
his 17th Idyl. The term apotheosis, among
the Romans, properly signified the elevation
of a deceased emperor to divine honours.
This practice, which was common upon the
death of almost all the emperors, appears to
have arisen from the opinion which was
generally entertained among the Romans,
that the souls or manes of their ancestors
became deities; and as it was common for
children to worship the manes of their
fathers, so it was natural for divine honours
to be publicly paid to a deceased emperor,
who was regarded as the parent of his
country. This apotheosis of an emperor was
usually called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consecratio</i>; and the emperor
who received the honour of an apotheosis
was usually said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in deorum numerum referri</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consecrari</i>, and whenever he is spoken of
after his death, the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divus</i> is prefixed
to his name. The funeral pile on which the
body of the deceased emperor was burnt, was
constructed of several stories in the form of
chambers rising one above another, and in
the highest an eagle was placed, which was
let loose as the fire began to burn, and which
was supposed to carry the soul of the emperor
from earth to heaven.</p>


<p id="Apparitor">APPĀRĬTOR, the general name for a
public servant of the magistrates at Rome,
namely, the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Accensus">Accensus</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Carnifex">Carnifex</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Coactor">Coactor</a></span>,

<span class="smcap"><a href="#Viator">Viator</a></span>, of whom an account is given in
separate articles. They were called apparitores
because they were at hand to execute
the commands of the magistrates (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod iis
apparebant</i>). Their service or attendance
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apparitio</i>.</p>


<p id="Appellatio">APPELLĀTĬO, appeal.&mdash;(1) <span class="smcap">Greek</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφεσις</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναδικία</span>.) Owing to the constitution of
the Athenian tribunals, each of which was
generally appropriated to its peculiar subjects
of cognisance, and therefore could not
be considered as homogeneous with or subordinate
to any other, there was little opportunity
for bringing appeals properly so called.
It is to be observed also, that in general a
cause was finally and irrevocably decided by
the verdict of the dicasts (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη αὐτοτελής</span>).
There were only a few exceptions in which
appeals and new trials might be resorted to.&mdash;(2)
<span class="smcap">Roman.</span> The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">appellatio</i>, and the
corresponding verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">appellare</i>, are used in the
early Roman writers to express the application
of an individual to a magistrate, and
particularly to a tribune, in order to protect
himself from some wrong inflicted, or threatened
to be inflicted. It is distinguished from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">provocatio</i>, which in the early writers is used
to signify an appeal to the populus in a
matter affecting life. It would seem that the
provocatio was an ancient right of the Roman
citizens. The surviving Horatius, who murdered
his sister, appealed from the duumviri
to the populus. The decemviri took away
the provocatio; but it was restored by the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Valeria et Horatia</i>, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 449, in the year
after the decemvirate, and it was at the same
time enacted, that in future no magistrate
should be made from whom there should be
no appeal. On this Livy remarks, that the
plebs were now protected by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">provocatio</i>
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribunicium auxilium</i>; this latter
term has reference to the appellatio properly
so called. The complete phrase to express
the provocatio is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">provocare ad populum</i>; and
the phrase which expresses the appellatio is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">appellare ad</i>, &amp;c.</p>


<p id="Apsis">APSIS or ABSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁψίς</span>), in architecture,
signified first, any building or portion of a
building of a circular form or vaulted, and
more especially the circular and vaulted end
of a Basilica.</p>


<p id="Aquae">ĂQUAE DUCTUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑδραγωγία</span>), literally, a
water-conduit, but the word is used especially
for the magnificent structures by means of
which Rome and other cities of the Roman
empire were supplied with water. A Roman
aqueduct, often called simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aqua</i>, may be
described in general terms as a channel, constructed
as nearly as possible with a regular
declivity from the source whence the water
was derived to the place where it was delivered,
carried through hills by means of
tunnels, and over valleys upon a substruction
of solid masonry or arches. The aqueduct is
mentioned by Strabo as among the structures
which were neglected by the Greeks, and
first brought into use by the Romans.
Springs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρῆναι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρουνοί</span>) were sufficiently
abundant in Greece to supply the great cities
with water; and they were frequently converted
into public fountains by the formation
of a head for their waters, and the erection
of an ornamental superstructure. Of this
we have an example in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Enneacrunos</i> at
Athens, which was constructed by Peisistratus
and his sons. The Romans were in a very
different position, with respect to the supply
of water, from most of the Greek cities.
They, at first, had recourse to the Tiber, and
to wells sunk in the city; but the water
obtained from those sources was very unwholesome,
and must soon have proved insufficient,
from the growth of the population.
It was this necessity that led to the invention
of aqueducts, in order to bring pure water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
from the hills which surround the Campagna.
The number of aqueducts was gradually increased,
partly at the public expense, and
partly by the munificence of individuals, till,
in the fourth century of the Christian era,
they amounted to fourteen. Of these only
four belong to the time of the republic, while
five were built in the reigns of Augustus and
Claudius.&mdash;1. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Appia</i>, begun by the
censor Appius Claudius Caecus in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 313.
Its sources were near the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Praenestina</i>,
between the seventh and eighth mile-stones.&mdash;2.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anio Vetus</i> was commenced forty years
later, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 273, by the censor M. Curius Dentatus,
and was finished by M. Fulvius Flaccus.
The water was derived from the river Anio,
above Tibur, at a distance of 20 Roman miles
from the city; but, on account of its windings,
its actual length was 43 miles.&mdash;3. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Marcia</i>, one of the most important of
the whole, was built by the praetor Q. Marcius
Rex, by command of the senate, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
144. It commenced at the side of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via
Valeria</i>, 36 miles from Rome.&mdash;4. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua
Tepula</i>, built by the censors Cn. Servilius
Caepio and L. Cassius Longinus in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 127,
began at a spot in the Lucullan or Tusculan
land, two miles to the right of the tenth
milestone on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Latina</i>. It was afterwards
connected with.&mdash;5. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Julia</i>,
built by Agrippa in his aedileship, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 33.
It was conducted from a source two miles to
the right of the twelfth milestone on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via
Latina</i>, first to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Tepula</i>, in which
it was merged as far as the reservoir (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">piscina</i>)
on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Latina</i>, seven miles from
Rome. From this reservoir the water was
carried along two distinct channels, on the
same substructions; the lower channel being
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Tepula</i>, and the upper the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Julia</i>; and this double aqueduct again
was united with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Marcia</i>, over the
watercourse of which the other two were
carried.&mdash;6. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Virgo</i>, built by Agrippa,
to supply his baths. From a source in a
marshy spot by the 8th milestone on the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Collatina</i>, it was conducted by a very
circuitous route.&mdash;7. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Alsietina</i>
(sometimes called also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Augusta</i>), on the
other side of the Tiber, was constructed by
Augustus from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lacus Alsietinus</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lago di
Martignano</i>), which lay 6500 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">passus</i> to the
right of the 14th milestone on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via
Claudia</i>.&mdash;8, 9. The two most magnificent
aqueducts were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Claudia</i> and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anio Novus</i> (or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Aniena Nova</i>), both
commenced by Caligula in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 36, and
finished by Claudius in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 50. The water
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Claudia</i> was derived from two
copious and excellent springs, near the 38th
milestone on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Sublacensis</i>. Its length
was nearly 46½ miles. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anio Novus</i> began
at the 42nd milestone. It was the longest
and the highest of all the aqueducts, its
length being nearly 59 miles, and some of its
arches 109 feet high. In the neighbourhood
of the city these two aqueducts were united,
forming two channels on the same arches, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claudia</i> below and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anio Novus</i> above.
These nine aqueducts were all that existed in
the time of Frontinus, who was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curator</i>
of the aqueducts in the reigns of Nerva and
Trajan. There was also another aqueduct,
not reckoned with the nine, because its waters
were no longer brought all the way to Rome,
viz.: 10. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Crabra</i>.&mdash;The following
were of later construction. 11. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua
Trajana</i>, brought by Trajan from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lacus
Sabatinus</i> (now <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bracciano</i>).&mdash;12. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua
Alexandrina</i>, constructed by Alexander Severus;
its source was in the lands of Tusculum,
about 14 miles from Rome.&mdash;13. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Septimiana</i>, built by Septimius Severus,
was perhaps only a branch of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Julia</i>.&mdash;14.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Algentia</i> had its source at
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. Algidus</i> by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Tusculana</i>. Its builder
is unknown.&mdash;Great pains were taken by
successive emperors to preserve and repair
the aqueducts. From the Gothic wars downwards,
they have for the most part shared
the fate of the other great Roman works of
architecture; their situation and purpose
rendering them peculiarly exposed to injury
in war; but still their remains form the most
striking features of the Campagna, over which
their lines of ruined arches, clothed with ivy
and the wild fig-tree, radiate in various directions.</p>

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acqua Paola</i>, the ancient
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alsietina</i>.&mdash;The following
woodcut represents a restored
section of the triple aqueduct
of Agrippa:&mdash;<em>a.</em> the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua

<em>c.</em> the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aqua Julia</i>. The two
latter are of brick and vaulted
over. The air-vents are also
shown.&mdash;The channel of an
aqueduct (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">specus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canalis</i>)
was a trough of brick or
stone, lined with cement, and
covered with a coping, which
was almost always arched;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and the water either ran directly through this
trough, or it was carried through pipes laid
along the trough. These pipes were of lead,
or terra-cotta (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fictiles</i>), and sometimes, for the
sake of economy, of leather. At convenient
points on the course of the aqueduct, and
especially near the middle and end, there was
generally a reservoir (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">piscina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">piscina limosa</i>)
in which the water might deposit any sediment
that it contained. The water was received,
when it reached the walls of the city,
in a vast reservoir called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castellum</i>, which
formed the <em>head of water</em> and also served the
purpose of a <em>meter</em>. From this principal
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castellum</i> the water flowed into other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castella</i>,
whence it was distributed for public and
private use. The term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castellum</i> is sometimes
also applied to the intermediate reservoirs
already mentioned. During the republic,
the censors and aediles had the superintendence
of the aqueducts. Augustus first
established <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curatores</i> (or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefecti</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquarum</i>,
who were invested with considerable authority.
They were attended outside the city
by two lictors, three public slaves, a secretary,
and other attendants. In the time of Nerva
and Trajan, 460 slaves were constantly employed
under the orders of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curatores
aquarum</i> in attending to the aqueducts. They
consisted of:&mdash;1. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villici</i>, whose duty it
was to attend to the pipes and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calices</i>. 2. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castellarii</i>, who had the superintendence of
all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castella</i>, both within and without the
city. 3. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circuitores</i>, so called because
they had to go from post to post, to examine
into the state of the works, and also to keep
watch over the labourers employed upon
them. 4. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silicarii</i>, or paviours. 5. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tectores</i>, or masons. These and other workmen
appear to have been included under the

<p id="Ara">ĀRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βωμός</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυτήριον</span>), an altar. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ara</i> was
a general term denoting any structure elevated
above the ground, and used to receive
upon it offerings made to the gods. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Altare</i>,
probably contracted from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alta ara</i>, was properly
restricted to the larger, higher, and
more expensive structures. Four specimens
of ancient altars are given below; the two in
the former woodcut are square, and those in
the latter round, which is the less common
form. At the top of three of the above altars
we see the hole intended to receive the fire
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐσχαρίς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐσχάρα</span>): the fourth was probably
intended for the offering of fruits or other
gifts, which were presented to the gods without
fire. When the altars were prepared for
sacrifice, they were commonly decorated with
garlands or festoons. These were composed
of certain kinds of leaves and flowers, which
were considered consecrated to such uses,
and were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbenae</i>. The altars constructed
with most labour and skill belonged
to temples; and they were erected either
before the temple or within the cella of the
temple, and principally before the statue of
the divinity to whom it was dedicated. The
altars in the area before the temple were
altars of burnt-offerings, at which animal
sacrifices (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">victimae</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφάγια</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερεῖα</span>) were presented:
only incense was burnt, or cakes and
bloodless sacrifices offered on the altars within
the building.</p>

<p id="Aratrum">ĂRĀTRUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄροτρον</span>), a plough. Among
the Greeks and Romans the three most essential
parts of the plough were,&mdash;the plough-tail
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γύης</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buris</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bura</i>), the share-beam
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔλυμα</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dens</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dentale</i>), that is, the piece of
wood to which the share is fixed, and the pole
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥυμός</span>], <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστοβοεύς</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">temo</i>). In the time and
country of Virgil it was the custom to force a
tree into the crooked form of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buris</i>, or
plough-tail. The upper end of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buris</i> being
held by the ploughman, the lower part,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
below its junction with the pole, was used to
hold the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dentale</i> or share-beam, which was
either sheathed with metal, or driven bare
into the ground, according to circumstances.
The term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vomer</i> was sometimes applied to the
end of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dentale</i>. To these three parts, the
two following are added in the description of
the plough by Virgil:&mdash;1. The <em>earth-boards</em>,
or <em>mould-boards</em> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aures</i>), rising on each side,
bending outwardly in such a manner as to
throw on either hand the soil which had been
previously loosened and raised by the share,
and adjusted to the share-beam (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dentale</i>),
which was made double for the purpose of
receiving them. 2. The <em>handle</em> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stiva</i>). Virgil
describes this part as used to turn the
plough at the end of the furrow; and it is
defined by an ancient commentator on Virgil
as the “handle by which the plough is directed.”
It is probable that as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dentalia</i>,
the two share-beams, were in the form of
the Greek letter Λ, which Virgil describes by
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duplici dorso</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buris</i> was fastened to the
left share-beam and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stiva</i> to the right, so
that the plough of Virgil was more like the
modern Lancashire plough, which is commonly
held behind with both hands. Sometimes,
however, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stiva</i> was used alone and
instead of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buris</i> or tail. In place of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stiva</i>
the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capulus</i> is sometimes employed. The
only other part of the plough requiring notice
is the coulter (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">culter</i>), which was used by the
Romans as it is with us. It was inserted
into the pole so as to depend vertically before
the share, cutting through the roots which
came in its way, and thus preparing for the
more complete overturning of the soil by the
share. Two small wheels were also added
to some ploughs. The plough, as described
by Virgil, corresponds in all essential particulars
with the plough now used about Mantua
and Venice. The Greeks and Romans
usually ploughed their land three times for
each crop. The first ploughing was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proscindere</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novare</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεοῦσθαι, νεάζεσθαι</span>);
the second <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">offringere</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iterare</i>; and the
third, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lirare</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tertiare</i>. The field which
underwent the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">proscissio</span>” was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vervactum</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novale</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεός</span>), and in this process
the coulter was employed, because the fresh
surface was entangled with numberless roots
which required to be divided before the soil
could be turned up by the share. The term
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">offringere</i>” from <em>ob</em> and <em>frangere</em>, was applied
to the second ploughing; because the
long parallel clods already turned up were
broken and cut across, by drawing the plough
through them at right angles to its former
direction. The field which underwent this
process was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ager iteratus</i>. After the
second ploughing the sower cast his seed.
Also the clods were often, though not always,
broken still further by a wooden mallet, or
by harrowing (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occatio</i>). The Roman ploughman
then, for the first time, attached the earth-boards
to his share. The effect of this adjustment
was to divide the level surface of
the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ager <em>iteratus</em></span>” into ridges. These were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porcae</i>, and also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lirae</i>, whence came
the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lirare</i>, to make ridges, and also
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delirare</i>, to decline from the straight line.
The earth-boards, by throwing the earth to
each side in the manner already explained,
both covered the newly-scattered seed, and
formed between the ridges furrows (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὔλακες</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sulci</i>) for carrying off the water. In this
state the field was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seges</i> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίπολος</span>.
When the ancients ploughed three times only,
it was done in the spring, summer, and autumn
of the same year. But in order to obtain
a still heavier crop, both the Greeks and
the Romans ploughed four times, the proscissio
being performed in the latter part of the
preceding year, so that between one crop and
another two whole years intervened.</p>

“the chief of the physicians.” The first

ἀρχιτεκτονία</ins></span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιτεκτονική</span>),
architecture. The necessity for a
habitation, and the attempt to adorn those
habitations which were intended for the gods,
are the two causes from which the art derives
its existence. In early times little
attention was paid to domestic architecture.
The resources of the art were lavished upon
the temples of the gods; and hence the
greater part of the history of Grecian architecture
is inseparably connected with that of
the temple, and has its proper place under
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Templum">Templum</a></span>, and the subordinate headings,
such as <span class="smcap"><a href="#Columna">Columna</a></span>, &amp;c. But, though the first
rise of architecture, as a fine art, is connected
with the temple, yet, viewed as the science
of construction, it must have been employed,
even earlier, for other purposes, such as the
erection of fortifications, palaces, treasuries,
and other works of utility. Accordingly, it
is the general opinion of antiquaries, that the
very earliest edifices, of which we have any
remains, are the so-called Cyclopean works,
in which we see huge unsquared blocks of
stone built together in the best way that
their shapes would allow. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Murus">Murus</a>.</span>] In addition
to these, however, there are other
purposes for which architecture, still using
the term in its lower sense, would be required
in a very early stage of political society;
such as the general arrangement of cities,
the provision of a place for the transaction of
public business, with the necessary edifices
appertaining to it [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Agora">Agora</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Forum">Forum</a></span>], and the
whole class of works which we embrace under
the head of civil engineering, such as those
for drainage [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cloaca">Cloaca</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Emissarium">Emissarius</a></span>], for communication
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Via">Via</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pons">Pons</a></span>], and for the supply
of water [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aquae">Aquae ductus</a></span>]. Almost equally
necessary are places devoted to public exercise,
health, and amusement, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Gymnasium">Gymnasium</a></span>,
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Stadium">Stadium</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Hippodromus">Hippodromus</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus">Circus</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Balneum">Balneum</a></span>,
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Theatrum">Theatrum</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Amphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</a></span>. Lastly, the
skill of the architect has been from the
earliest times employed to preserve the memory
of departed men and past events; and
hence we have the various works of monumental
and triumphal architecture, which are
described under the heads <span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Arcus">Arcus</a></span>,
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Columna">Columna</a></span>. The history of architecture may
be divided into five periods. The first, which
is chiefly mythical, comes down to the time
of Cypselus, Ol. 30, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 660: the second
period comes down to the termination of the
Persian war, Ol. 75. 2, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 478: the third is
the brilliant period from the end of the Persian
war to the death of Alexander the Great,
Ol. 114, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 323: the fourth period extends
to the battle of Actium, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 31: the fifth
period embraces the architecture of the Roman
empire till it became mingled with the
Gothic. Strongly fortified cities, palaces, and
treasuries are the chief works of the earlier
part of the first period; and to it may be
referred most of the so-called Cyclopean remains;
while the era of the Dorian invasion
marks, in all probability, the commencement
of the Dorian style of temple architecture.
In the second period the art made rapid advances
under the powerful patronage of the
aristocracies in some cities, as at Sparta, and
of the tyrants in others, as Cypselus at
Corinth, Theagnes at Megara, Cleisthenes at
Sicyon, the Peisistratids at Athens, and Polycrates
at Samos. Architecture now assumed
decidedly the character of a fine art, and
became associated with the sister arts of
sculpture and painting, which are essential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
to its development. Magnificent temples
sprung up in all the principal Greek cities;
and while the Doric order was brought almost,
if not quite, to perfection, in Greece
Proper, in the Doric colonies of Asia Minor,
and in Central Italy and Sicily, the Ionic
order appeared, already perfect at its first
invention, in the great temple of Artemis at
Ephesus. The ruins still existing at Paestum,
Syracuse, Agrigentum, Selinus, Aegina, and
other places, are imperishable monuments of
this period. To it also belong the great works
of the Roman kings. The commencement of
the third and most brilliant period of the art
was signalized by the rebuilding of Athens,
the establishment of regular principles for
the laying out of cities by Hippodamus of
Miletus, and the great works of the age of
Pericles, by the contemporaries of Phidias, at
Athens, Eleusis, and Olympia. The first part
of the fourth period saw the extension of the
Greek architecture over the countries conquered
by Alexander, and, in the West, the
commencement of the new style, which arose
from the imitation, with some alterations, of
the Greek forms by Roman architects, to
which the conquest of Greece gave, of course,
a new impulse. By the time of Augustus,
Rome was adorned with every kind of public
and private edifice, surrounded by villas, and
furnished with roads and aqueducts; and
these various erections were adorned by the
forms of Grecian art; but already Vitruvius
begins to complain that the purity of that art
is corrupted by the intermixture of heterogeneous
forms. This process of deterioration
went on rapidly during the fifth period,
though combined at first with increasing
magnificence in the scale and number of the
buildings erected. The early part of this
period is made illustrious by the numerous
works of Augustus and his successors, especially
the Flavii, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian,
and the Antonines, at Rome and in the provinces;
but from the time of the Antonines
the decline of the art was rapid and decided.
In one department a new impulse was given
to architecture by the rise of Christian
churches, which were generally built on the
model of the Roman Basilica. One of the
most splendid specimens of Christian architecture
is the church of S. Sophia at Constantinople,
built in the reign of Justinian, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
537, and restored, after its partial destruction
by an earthquake, in 554. But, long before
this time, the Greco-Roman style had become
thoroughly corrupted, and that new style,
which is called the Byzantine, had arisen out
of the mixture of Roman architecture with
ideas derived from the Northern nations.</p>


<p id="Architheorus">ARCHITHĔŌRUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιθέωρος</span>). [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Delia">Delia</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Archon">ARCHON (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων</span>). The government of
Athens began with monarchy, and, after passing
through a dynasty<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and aristocracy, ended
in democracy. Of the kings of Athens, considered
as the capital of Attica, Theseus may
be said to have been the first; for to him,
whether as a real individual or a representative
of a certain period, is attributed the
union of the different and independent states
of Attica under one head. The last was
Codrus; in acknowledgment of whose patriotism
in meeting death for his country,
the Athenians are said to have determined
that no one should succeed him with the
title of king (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεύς</span>). It seems, however,
equally probable that it was the nobles who
availed themselves of the opportunity to
serve their own interests, by abolishing the
kingly power for another, the possessors of
which they called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archontes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχοντες</span>) or
rulers. These for some time continued to be
like the kings of the house of Codrus, appointed
for life: still an important point was
gained by the nobles, the office being made
accountable (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπεύθυνος</span>), which of course implies
that the nobility had some control over
it. This state of things lasted for twelve
reigns of archons. The next step was to
limit the continuance of the office to ten
years, still confining it to the Medontidae, or
house of Codrus, so as to establish what the
Greeks called a dynasty, till the archonship
of Eryxias, the last archon of that family
elected as such. At the end of his ten years
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 684), a much greater change took place:
the archonship was made annual, and its
various duties divided among a college of
nine, chosen by suffrage (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</span>) from the
Eupatridae, or Patricians, and no longer
elected from the Medontidae exclusively. This
arrangement lasted till the time of Solon, who
still continued the election by suffrage, but
made the qualification for office depend, not
on birth, but property. The election by lot
is believed to have been introduced by Cleisthenes
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 508). The last change is supposed
to have been made by Aristides, who
after the battle of Plataeae (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 479) abolished
the property qualification, throwing
open the archonship and other magistracies
to all the citizens; that is, to the Thetes, as
well as the other classes, the former of whom
were not allowed by Solon’s laws to hold any
magistracy at all. Still, after the removal of
the old restrictions, some security was left to
insure respectability; for, previously to an
archon entering on office, he underwent an
examination, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anacrisis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκρισις</span>),
as to his being a legitimate and a good citizen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
a good son, and qualified in point of property,
but the latter limitation was either done away
with by Aristides, or soon became obsolete.
Yet, even after passing a satisfactory <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anacrisis</i>,
each of the archons, in common with
other magistrates, was liable to be deposed on
complaint of misconduct made before the
people, at the first regular assembly in each
prytany. On such an occasion the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epicheirotonia</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειροτονία</span>), as it was called, took
place: and we read that in one case the whole
college of archons was deprived of office
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποχειροτονεῖσθαι</span>). In consequence of the
democratical tendency of the assembly and
courts of justice established by Solon, the
archons lost the great political power which
they at one time possessed. They became, in
fact, not as of old directors of the government,
but merely municipal magistrates, exercising
functions and bearing titles described below.
It has been already stated, that the duties of
the single archon were shared by a college of
nine. The first, or president of this body,
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archon</i>, by way of pre-eminence,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archon Eponymus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων ἐπώνυμος</span>), from
the year being distinguished by and registered
in his name. The second was styled
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archon Basileus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων βασιλεύς</span>), or the
King Archon; the third <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polemarchus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολέμαρχος</span>),
or commander-in-chief; the remaining
six, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thesmothetae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεσμοθέται</span>), or legislators.
As regards the duties of the archons,
it is sometimes difficult to distinguish what
belonged to them individually, and what collectively.
It seems that a considerable portion
of the judicial functions of the ancient
kings devolved upon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archon Eponymus</i>,
who was also constituted a sort of state protector
of those who were unable to defend
themselves. Thus he was to superintend
orphans, heiresses, families losing their representatives,
widows left pregnant, and to see
that they were not wronged in any way.
This archon had also the superintendence
of the greater Dionysia, and the Thargelia.
The functions of the <em>King Archon</em> were almost
all connected with religion; his distinguishing
title shows that he was considered a representative
of the old kings in their capacity of
high priest, as the Rex Sacrificulus was at
Rome. Thus he presided at the Lenaea, or
older Dionysia; superintended the mysteries
and the games called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lampadephoriae</i>, and
had to offer up sacrifices and prayers in the
Eleusinium, both at Athens and Eleusis.
Moreover, indictments for impiety, and controversies
about the priesthood, were laid before
him; and, in cases of murder, he brought
the trial into the court of the areiopagus, and
voted with its members. His wife, also, who
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Basilissa</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασίλισσα</span>), had to offer
certain sacrifices, and therefore it was required
that she should be a citizen of pure
blood, without stain or blemish. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polemarch</i>
was originally, as his name denotes,
the commander-in-chief, and we find him
discharging military duties as late as the
battle of Marathon, in conjunction with the
ten <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Strategi</i>; he there took, like the kings of
old, the command of the right wing of the
army. This, however, seems to be the last
occasion on record of this magistrate appointed
by lot being invested with such important
functions; and in after ages we find
that his duties ceased to be military, having
been, in a great measure, transferred to the
protection and superintendence of the resident
aliens, so that he resembled in many respects
the praetor peregrinus at Rome. Thus, all
actions affecting aliens, the isoteles and
proxeni were brought before him previously
to trial. Moreover, it was the polemarch’s
duty to offer the yearly sacrifice to Artemis,
in commemoration of the vow made by Callimachus,
at Marathon, and to arrange the
funeral games in honour of those who fell in
war. The six <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thesmothetae</i> were extensively
connected with the administration of justice,
and appear to have been called legislators,
because, in the absence of a written code,
they might be said to make laws, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thesmi</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεσμοί</span>), in the ancient language of Athens,
though in reality they only explained them.
They were required to review, every year,
the whole body of laws, that they might
detect any inconsistencies or superfluities,
and discover whether any laws which were
abrogated were in the public records amongst
the rest. Their report was submitted to the
people, who referred the necessary alterations
to a legislative committee chosen for the purpose,
and called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nomothetae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νομοθέται</span>). The
chief part of the duties of the thesmothetae
consisted in receiving informations, and bringing
cases to trial in the courts of law, of the
days of sitting in which they gave public
notice. They did not try them themselves,
but seem to have constituted a sort of grand
jury, or inquest. The trial itself took place
before the Dicastae. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Dicastes">Dicastae</a>.</span>] It is necessary
to be cautious in our interpretation of
the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχή</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχοντες</span>, since they have
a double meaning in the Attic orators, sometimes
referring to the archons peculiarly so
called, and sometimes to any other magistracy.
The archons had various privileges and honours.
The greatest of the former was the
exemption from the trierarchies&mdash;a boon not
allowed even to the successors of Harmodius
and Aristogeiton. As a mark of their office,
they wore a chaplet or crown of myrtle; and
if any one struck or abused one of the archons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
when wearing this badge of office, he became
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτιμος</span>), or infamous in the fullest
extent, thereby losing his civic rights. The
archons, at the close of their year of service,
were admitted among the members of the
areiopagus. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Areiopagus">Areiopagus</a>.</span>]</p>

  <div class="caption">Arch of Tiryns. (Gell’s Itinerary, pl. 16.)</div>
</div>

<p id="Arcus">ARCUS (also fornix), an arch. A true
arch is formed of a series of wedge-like
stones, or of bricks, supporting each other,
and all bound firmly together by their mutual
pressure. It would seem that the arch, as
thus defined, and as used by the Romans,
was not known to the Greeks in the early
periods of their history. But they made use
of a contrivance, even in the heroic age, by
which they were enabled to gain all the
advantages of our archway in making corridors,
or hollow galleries, and which in appearance
resembled the pointed arch, such as
is now termed Gothic. This was effected by
cutting away the superincumbent stones in
the manner already described, at an angle of
about 45° with the horizon. The mode of
construction and appearance of such arches
is represented in the annexed drawing of the
walls of Tiryns. The gate of Signia (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Segni</i>)
in Latium exhibits a similar example. The
principle of the true arch seems to have been
known to the Romans from the earliest period;
it is used in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cloaca Maxima</i>. It is most
probably an Etruscan invention. The use of
it constitutes one leading distinction between
Greek and Roman architecture, for by its
application the Romans were enabled to execute
works of far bolder construction than
those of the Greeks. The Romans, however,
never used any other form of arch than the
semicircle. <span id="Arcu_t">The arcus triumphalis</span>, triumphal
arch, was a structure peculiar to the Romans,
erected in honour of an individual, or in
commemoration of a conquest. Triumphal
arches were built across the principal streets
of Rome, and, according to the space of their
respective localities, consisted of a single
archway, or a central one for carriages, and
two smaller ones on each side for foot-passengers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Those actually made use of on the
occasion of a triumphal entry and procession
were merely temporary and hastily erected;
and, having served their purpose, were taken
down again, and sometimes replaced by others
of more durable materials. Stertinius is the
first upon record who erected anything of the
kind. He built an arch in the Forum Boarium,
about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 196, and another in the
Circus Maximus, each of which was surmounted
by gilt statues. There are twenty-one
arches recorded by different writers, as
having been erected in the city of Rome, five
of which now remain:&mdash;1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arcus Drusi</i>,
which was erected to the honour of Claudius
Drusus on the Appian way. 2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arcus Titi</i>,
at the foot of the Palatine, which was erected
to the honour of Titus, after his conquest of
Judaea; the bas-reliefs of this arch represent
the spoils from the temple of Jerusalem
carried in triumphal procession. 3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arcus
Septimii Severi</i>, which was erected by the
senate (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 207) at the end of the Via
Sacra, in honour of that emperor and his two
sons, Caracalla and Geta, on account of his
conquest of the Parthians and Arabians. 4.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arcus Gallieni</i>, erected to the honour of Gallienus
by a private individual, M. Aurelius
Victor. 5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arcus Constantini</i>, which was
larger than the arch of Titus. As a specimen
of the triumphal arches, a drawing of the arch
of Drusus is given in the preceding page.</p>

<p id="Arcus_b">ARCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βιός</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόξον</span>), the bow used for
shooting arrows, is one of the most ancient
of all weapons, but is characteristic of Asia
rather than of Europe. In the Roman armies
it was scarcely ever employed except by auxiliaries;
and these auxiliaries, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sagittarii</i>,
were chiefly Cretes and Arabians.
The upper of the two figures below shows
the Scythian or Parthian bow unstrung; the
lower one represents the usual form of the
Grecian bow, which had a double curvature,
consisting of two circular portions united by
the handle. When not used, the bow was

which was made of leather, and sometimes
ornamented. It frequently held the arrows
as well as the bow, and on this account is
often confounded with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pharetra</i> or quiver.</p>

to make this floor hard; it was sometimes

covered with clay and smoothed with a roller.</p>


<p id="Areiopagus">ĂREIOPĂGUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ Ἄρειος πάγος</span>, or hill of
Ares) was a rocky eminence, lying to the
west of, and not far from the Acropolis at
Athens. It was the place of meeting of the
council (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἡ ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ βουλή</span>), which was
sometimes called <em>The Upper Council</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἡ ἄνω
βουλή</span>), to distinguish it from the senate of
Five-hundred, which sat in the Cerameicus
within the city. It was a body of very
remote antiquity, acting as a criminal tribunal,
and existed long before the time of
Solon, but he so far modified its constitution
and sphere of duty, that he may almost be
called its founder. What that original constitution
was, must in some degree be left to
conjecture, though there is every reason to
suppose that it was aristocratical, the members
being taken, like the ephetae, from the
noble patrician families. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ephetae">Ephetae</a>.</span>] By
the legislation of Solon the Areiopagus was
composed of the ex-archons, who, after an
unexceptionable discharge of their duties,
“went up” to the Areiopagus, and became
members of it for life, unless expelled for
misconduct. As Solon made the qualification
for the office of archon to depend not on birth
but on property, the council after his time
ceased to be aristocratic in constitution; but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
as we learn from Attic writers, continued so
in spirit. In fact, Solon is said to have
formed the two councils, the senate and the
Areiopagus, to be a check upon the democracy;
that, as he himself expressed it, “the
state riding upon them as anchors might be
less tossed by storms.” Nay, even after the
archons were no longer elected by suffrage,
but by lot, and the office was thrown open by
Aristides to all the Athenian citizens, the
“upper council” still retained its former tone
of feeling. Moreover, besides these changes
in its constitution, Solon altered and extended
its functions. Before his time it was only a
criminal court, trying cases of “wilful murder
and wounding, of arson and poisoning,”
whereas he gave it extensive powers of a
censorial and political nature. Thus we learn
that he made the council an “overseer of
everything, and the guardian of the laws,”
empowering it to inquire how any one got
his living and to punish the idle; and we are
also told that the Areiopagites were “superintendents
of good order and decency,” terms
as unlimited and undefined as Solon not
improbably wished to leave their authority.
When heinous crimes had notoriously been
committed, but the guilty parties were not
known, or no accuser appeared, the Areiopagus
inquired into the subject, and reported
to the demus. <span id="Apophasis">The</span> report or information
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apophasis</i>. This was a
duty which they sometimes undertook on
their own responsibility, and in the exercise
of an old established right, and sometimes on
the order of the demus. Nay, to such an
extent did they carry their power, that on
one occasion they apprehended an individual
(Antiphon), who had been acquitted by the
general assembly, and again brought him to
a trial, which ended in his condemnation and
death. Again, we find them revoking an
appointment whereby Aeschines was made
the advocate of Athens before the Amphictyonic
council, and substituting Hyperides in
his room. They also had duties connected
with religion, one of which was to superintend
the sacred olives growing about Athens,
and try those who were charged with destroying
them; and in general it was their office
to punish the impious and irreligious. Independent,
then, of its jurisdiction as a criminal
court in cases of wilful murder, which Solon
continued to the Areiopagus, its influence
must have been sufficiently great to have been
a considerable obstacle to the aggrandisement
of the democracy at the expense of the other
parties in the state. Accordingly, we find
that Pericles, who was opposed to the aristocracy,
resolved to diminish its power and
circumscribe its sphere of action. His coadjutor
in this work was Ephialtes, a statesman
of inflexible integrity, and also a military
commander. They experienced much opposition
in their attempts, not only in the assembly,
but also on the stage, where Aeschylus
produced his tragedy of the Eumenides, the
object of which was to impress upon the
Athenians the dignity, sacredness, and constitutional
worth of the institution which
Pericles and Ephialtes wished to reform.
Still the opposition failed: a decree was
carried by which, as Aristotle says, the Areiopagus
was “mutilated,” and many of its
hereditary rights abolished, though it is
difficult to ascertain the precise nature of the
alterations which Pericles effected. The jurisdiction
of the Areiopagus in cases of murder
was still left to them. In such cases the
process was as follows:&mdash;The king archon
brought the case into court, and sat as one of
the judges, who were assembled in the open
air, probably to guard against any contamination
from the criminal. The accuser first
came forwards to make a solemn oath that his
accusation was true, standing over the slaughtered
victims, and imprecating extirpation
upon himself and his whole family were it
not so. The accused then denied the charge
with the same solemnity and form of oath.
Each party then stated his case with all
possible plainness, keeping strictly to the
subject, and not being allowed to appeal in
any way to the feelings or passions of the
judges. After the first speech, a criminal
accused of murder might remove from Athens,
and thus avoid the capital punishment fixed
by Draco’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thesmi</i>, which on this point were
still in force. Except in cases of parricide,
neither the accuser nor the court had power
to prevent this; but the party who thus
evaded the extreme punishment was not
allowed to return home, and when any decree
was passed at Athens to legalize the return
of exiles, an exception was always made
against those who had thus left their country.
The Areiopagus continued to exist, in name
at least, till a very late period. Thus we find
Cicero mentioning the council in his letters;
and an individual is spoken of as an Areiopagite
under the emperors Gratian and Theodosius
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 380). The case of St. Paul is
generally quoted as an instance of the authority
of the Areiopagus in religious matters;
but the words of the sacred historian do not
necessarily imply that he was brought before
the council. It may, however, be remarked,
that the Areiopagites certainly took cognizance
of the introduction of new and unauthorised
forms of religious worship, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίθετα ἱερά</span>,
in contradistinction to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάτρια</span> or older
rites of the state.</p>

<p id="Argei">ARGĒI, the name given by the pontifices
to the places consecrated by Numa for the
celebration of religious services. Varro calls
them the chapels of the argei, and says they
were twenty-seven in number, distributed in
the different districts of the city. There was
a tradition that these argei were named from
the chieftains who came with Hercules, the
Argive, to Rome, and occupied the Capitoline,
or, as it was anciently called, Saturnian hill.
It is impossible to say what is the historical
value or meaning of this legend; we may,
however, notice its conformity with the statement
that Rome was founded by the Pelasgians,
with whom the name of Argos was
connected. The name argei was also given
to certain figures thrown into the Tiber from
the Sublician bridge, on the Ides of May in
every year. This was done by the pontifices,
the vestals, the praetors, and other citizens,
after the performance of the customary sacrifices.
The images were thirty in number,
made of bulrushes, and in the form of men.
Ovid makes various suppositions to account
for the origin of this rite; we can only conjecture
that it was a symbolical offering, to
propitiate the gods, and that the number was
a representative either of the thirty patrician
curiae at Rome, or perhaps of the thirty Latin
townships.</p>


<p id="Argentarii">ARGENTĀRĬI, bankers or money changers.

carrying on their business, and which were in
the market place. Their principal occupation
was that of changing money; but they frequently
took money, at a moderate premium,
from persons who did not like to occupy
themselves with the management of their
own affairs, and placed it out at interest.
Their usual interest was 36 per cent.; a
rate that at present scarcely occurs except
in cases of money lent on bottomry. The
only instance of a bank recognized and
conducted on behalf of the state occurs at
Byzantium, where at one time it was let by
the republic to capitalists to farm. Yet the
state probably exercised some kind of superintendence
over the private bankers, since it
is hardly possible otherwise to account for
the unlimited confidence which they enjoyed.&mdash;(2)
<span id="Depositum" class="smcap">Roman.</span> The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Argentarii</i> at Rome must
be distinguished from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensarii</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummularii</i>,
or public bankers. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mensarii">Mensarii</a>.</span>]
The argentarii were private persons, who
carried on business on their own responsibility,
and were not in the service of the
republic; but the shops or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabernae</i> about the
forum, which they occupied, and in which
they transacted their business, were state
property. The business of the argentarii may
be divided into the following branches. 1.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Permutatio</i>, or the exchange of foreign coin
for Roman, and in later times the giving of
bills of exchange payable in foreign towns.
2. The keeping of sums of money for other
persons. Such money might be deposited by
the owner merely to save himself the trouble
of keeping it and making payments, and in
this case it was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">depositum</i>; the argentarius
then paid no interest, and the money
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vacua pecunia</i>. Or the money was
deposited on condition of the argentarius paying
interest; in this case the money was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">creditum</i>. A payment made through a
banker was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per mensam</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de mensa</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per mensae scripturam</i>, while a payment made
by the debtor in person was a payment <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex arca</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de domo</i>. An argentarius never paid away
any person’s money without being either authorised
by him in person or receiving a
cheque which was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perscriptio</i>. The
argentarii kept accurate accounts in books
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">codices</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rationes</i>, and there
is every reason for believing that they were
acquainted with what is called in book-keeping
double entry. When a party found to be
in debt paid what he owed, he had his name
effaced (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen expedire</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">expungere</i>) from
the banker’s books. 3. Their connection
with commerce and public auctions. In private
sales and purchases, they sometimes
acted as agents for either party (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interpretes</i>),
and sometimes they undertook to sell the
whole estate of a person, as an inheritance.
At public auctions they were almost invariably
present, registering the articles sold,
their prices, and purchasers, and receiving
the payment from the purchasers. 4. The
testing of the genuineness of coins (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probatio
nummorum</i>). This, however, seems originally
to have been a part of the duty of public
officers, the mensarii or nummularii, until in
the course of time the opinion of an argentarius
also came to be looked upon as decisive.
5. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solidorum venditio</i>, that is, the obligation
of purchasing from the mint the newly
coined money, and circulating it among the
people. This branch of their functions occurs
only under the empire. The argentarii
formed a collegium, divided into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">societates</i> or
corporations, which alone had the right to
admit new members of their guild. None
but freemen could become members of such
a corporation. It has already been observed
that the argentarii had their shops round the
forum: hence to become bankrupt was expressed
by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foro cedere</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abire</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foro mergi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>


<p id="Argentum">ARGENTUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄργυρος</span>), silver. The relative
value of gold and silver differed considerably
at different periods in Greek and
Roman history. Herodotus mentions it as
13 to 1; Plato, as 12 to 1; Menander, as
10 to 1; and Livy as 10 to 1, about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
189. According to Suetonius, Julius Caesar,
on one occasion, exchanged silver for gold in
the proportion of 9 to 1; but the most usual
proportion under the early Roman emperors
was about 12 to 1. The proportion in modern
times, since the discovery of the American
mines, has varied between 17 to 1 and 14
to 1. In the earliest times the Greeks obtained
their silver chiefly as an article of
commerce from the Phocaeans and the Samians;
but they soon began to work the rich
mines of their own country and its islands.
The chief mines were in Siphnos, Thessaly,
and Attica. In the last-named country, the
silver mines of Laurion furnished a most
abundant supply, and were generally regarded
as the chief source of the wealth of Athens.
The Romans obtained most of their silver
from the very rich mines of Spain, which
had been previously worked by the Phoenicians
and Carthaginians, and which, though
abandoned for those of Mexico, are still not
exhausted. By far the most important use of
silver among the Greeks was for money.
There are sufficient reasons for believing
that, until some time after the end of the
Peloponnesian war, the Athenians had no
gold currency. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aurum">Aurum</a>.</span>] It may be remarked
that all the words connected with money are
derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄργυρος</span>, and not from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσός</span>, as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταργυρόω</span>, “to bribe with money;” <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀργυραμοιβός</span>,
“a money changer,” &amp;c.; and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄργυρος</span> is itself not unfrequently used to
signify money in general, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes</i> is in Latin.
At Rome, on the contrary, silver was not
coined till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 269, before which period
Greek silver was in circulation at Rome; and
the principal silver coin of the Romans, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">denarius</i>, was borrowed from the Greek
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">drachma</i>. For further details respecting
silver money, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Denarius">Denarius</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Drachma">Drachma</a></span>.
From a very early period, silver was used
also in works of art; and the use of it for
mere purposes of luxury and ostentation, as
in plate, was very general both in Greece and
Rome.</p>


<p id="Argyraspides">ARGỸRASPĬDES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀργυράσπιδες</span>), a division
of the Macedonian army, who were so called
because they carried shields covered with
silver plates.</p>


<p id="Argyrocopeion">ARGỸROCŎPEION (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀργυροκοπεῖον</span>), the
place where money was coined, the mint, at
Athens.</p>


<p id="Aries">ĂRĬES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κριός</span>), the battering-ram, was used
to batter down the walls of besieged cities.
It consisted of a large beam, made of the
trunk of a tree, especially of a fir or an ash.
To one end was fastened a mass of bronze
or iron (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεφαλή</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐμβολή</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προτομή</span>), which
resembled in its form the head of a ram.
The aries in its simplest state was borne
and impelled by human hands, without other
assistance. In an improved form, the ram
was surrounded with iron bands, to which
rings were attached for the purpose of suspending
it by ropes or chains from a beam fixed
transversely over it. By this contrivance
the soldiers were relieved from the necessity
of supporting the weight of the ram, and
could with ease give it a rapid and forcible
motion backwards and forwards. The use of
this machine was further aided by placing
the frame in which it was suspended upon
wheels, and also by constructing over it a
wooden roof, so as to form a “testudo,”
which protected the besieging party from
the defensive assaults of the besieged.</p>

<p id="Aristocratia">ĀRISTOCRĂTĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀριστοκρατία</span>), signifies
literally “the government of the best men,”
and as used by Plato, Aristotle, Polybius, &amp;c.,
it meant the government of a class whose
supremacy was founded not on wealth merely,
but on personal distinction. That there should
be an aristocracy, moreover, it was essential
that the administration of affairs should be
conducted with a view to the promotion of
the general interests, not for the exclusive or
predominant advantage of the privileged class<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
As soon as the government ceased to be thus
conducted, or whenever the only title to political
power in the dominant class was the
possession of superior wealth, the constitution
was termed an oligarchy (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγαρχία</span>), which,
in the technical use of the term, was always
looked upon as a corruption (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρέκβασις</span>) of
an aristocracy. In the practical application
of the term aristocracy, however, the personal
excellence which was held to be a necessary
element was not of a higher kind than what,
according to the deeply-seated ideas of the
Greeks, was commonly hereditary in families
of noble birth, and in early times would be
the ordinary accompaniments of noble rank,
namely, wealth, military skill, and superior
education and intelligence. It is to be noted
that the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀριστοκρατία</span> is never, like
the English term <em>aristocracy</em>, the name of
a class, but only of a particular political
constitution.</p>

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅπλα</span>), arms, armour. Homer describes in
various passages an entire suit of armour,
and we observe that it consisted of the same
portions which were used by the Greek soldiers
ever after. Moreover, the order of putting
them on is always the same. The heavy-armed
warrior, having already a tunic around
his body, and preparing for combat, puts on&mdash;1.
his greaves (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κνημῖδες</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ocreae</i>); 2. his
cuirass (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θώραξ</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lorica</i>), to which belonged
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίτρη</span> underneath, and the zone (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζώνη</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωστῆρ</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cingulum</i>), above; 3. his sword
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξίφος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ensis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gladius</i>), hung on the left side
of his body by means of a belt which passed
over the right shoulder; 4. the large round
shield (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάκος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσπίς</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clipeus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutum</i>), supported
in the same manner; 5. his helmet
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόρυς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνέη</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cassis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">galea</i>); 6. he took his
spear (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγχος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόρυ</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta</i>), or in many cases,
two spears. The form and use of these portions
are described in separate articles, under
their Latin names. The annexed cut exhibits
them all. Those who were defended in the
manner which has now been represented are
called by Homer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aspistae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσπισταί</span>), from
their great shield (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσπίς</span>); also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angemachi</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγχεμάχοι</span>), because they fought hand to
hand with their adversaries; but much more
commonly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promachi</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόμαχοι</span>), because they
occupied the front of the army. In later
times, the heavy-armed soldiers were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hoplitae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁπλίται</span>), because the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hopla</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄπλα</span>) more especially denoted the defensive
armour, the shield and thorax. By wearing
these they were distinguished from the light-armed
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψιλοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄνοπλοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνῆται</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνῆτες</span>),
who, instead of being defended by the
shield and thorax, had a much slighter covering,
sometimes consisting of skins, and sometimes
of leather or cloth; and instead of the
sword or lance, they commonly fought with
darts, stones, bows and arrows, or slings.
Besides the heavy and light-armed soldiers,
another description of men, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peltastae</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πελτασταί</span>), also formed a part of the Greek
army, though we do not hear of them in
early times. Instead of the large round
shield, they carried a smaller one called the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pelté</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέλτη</span>), and in other respects their armour,
though heavier and more effective than
that of the psili, was much lighter than that
of the hoplites. The weapon on which they
principally depended was the spear. The
Roman legions consisted, as the Greek infantry
for the most part did, of heavy and
light-armed troops (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gravis et levis armatura</i>).
The preceding figure represents two heavy-armed
Roman soldiers. All the essential parts
of the Roman heavy armour (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lorica</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ensis</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clipeus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">galea</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta</i>) are mentioned together,
except the spear, in a well-known passage of
St. Paul (<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eph.</cite> vi. 17).</p>


<p id="Armarium">ARMĀRĬUM, originally a place for keeping

atrium of the house.</p>

both by men and women. It was a favourite
ornament of the Medes and Persians.
Bracelets do not appear to have been worn
among the Greeks by the male sex, but Greek
ladies had bracelets of various materials,
shapes, and styles of ornament. They frequently
exhibited the form of snakes, and
were in such cases called snakes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄφεις</span>) by
the Athenians. According to their length,
they went once, twice, or thrice round the
arm, or even a greater number of times.
The Roman generals frequently bestowed armillae
upon soldiers for deeds of extraordinary
merit.</p>

<p id="Armilustrium">ARMĬLUSTRĬUM, a Roman festival for

Vicus Armilustri.</p>


<p id="Arra">ARRA, ARRĂBO, or ARRHA, ARRHABO,
was the thing which purchasers and vendors
gave to one another, whether it was a sum
of money or anything else, as an evidence of
the contract being made: it was no essential
part of the contract of buying and selling,
but only evidence of agreement as to price.
The term arrha, in its general sense of an
evidence of agreement, was also used on
other occasions, as in the case of betrothment
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sponsalia</i>). Sometimes the word arrha is

were selected every year by the king
archon from the most distinguished families,
two of whom superintended the weaving of
the sacred peplus of Athena; the two others
had to carry the mysterious and sacred vessels
of the goddess. These latter remained a
whole year on the Acropolis; and when the
festival commenced, the priestess of the goddess
placed vessels upon their heads, the contents
of which were neither known to them
nor to the priestess. With these they descended
to a natural grotto within the district
of Aphrodite in the gardens. Here they deposited
the sacred vessels, and carried back
something else, which was covered and likewise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
unknown to them. After this the girls
were dismissed and others were chosen to supply
their place in the acropolis.</p>

<p id="Arvales">ARVĀLES FRĀTRES, formed a college or
company of twelve priests, and were so called
from offering public sacrifices for the fertility
of the fields. That they were of extreme antiquity
is proved by the legend which refers
their institution to Romulus, of whom it is
said, that when his nurse Acca Laurentia lost
one of her twelve sons, he allowed himself
to be adopted by her in his place, and called
himself and the remaining eleven “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fratres
Arvales</span>.” We also find a college called the
Sodales Titii, and as the latter were confessedly
of Sabine origin, and instituted for
the purpose of keeping up the Sabine religious
rites, it is probable that these colleges
corresponded one to the other&mdash;the Fratres
Arvales being connected with the Latin, and
the Sodales Titii with the Sabine element of
the Roman state. The office of the fratres
arvales was for life, and was not taken away
even from an exile or captive. One of their
annual duties was to celebrate a three days’
festival in honour of Dea Dia, supposed to be
Ceres, sometimes held on the 17th, 19th, and
20th, sometimes on the 27th, 29th, and 30th
of May. But besides this festival of the Dea
Dia, the fratres arvales were required on various
occasions, under the emperors, to make
vows and offer up thanksgivings. Under Tiberius,
the Fratres Arvales performed sacrifices
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ambarvalia</i>, at various places
on the borders of the ager Romanus, or original
territory of Rome; and it is probable
that this was a custom handed down from
time immemorial, and, moreover, that it was
a duty of the priesthood to invoke a blessing
on the whole territory of Rome. There were
also the private <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ambarvalia</i>, which were so
called from the victim (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hostia ambarvalis</i>)
that was slain on the occasion being led three
times round the corn-fields, before the sickle
was put to the corn. This victim was accompanied
by a crowd of merry-makers, the
reapers and farm-servants dancing and singing,
as they marched, the praises of Ceres,
and praying for her favour and presence,
while they offered her the libations of milk,
honey, and wine. This ceremony was also
called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lustratio</i>, or purification.</p>


<p id="Arx">ARX signifies a height within the walls of
a city, upon which a citadel was built, and
thus came to be applied to the citadel itself.
Thus one of the summits of the Capitoline
hill at Rome is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arx</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arx</i> was the
regular place at Rome for taking the auspices,
and was hence likewise called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auguraculum</i>;
or, more probably, the auguraculum was a
place in the Arx.</p>


<p id="As">AS, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libra</i>, a pound, the unit of weight
among the Romans. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Libra_a">Libra</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="As_c">AS, the unit of value in the Roman and
old Italian coinages, was made of copper, or
of the mixed metal called <span class="smcap"><a href="#Aes">Aes</a></span>. It was originally
of the weight of a pound of twelve
ounces, whence it was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">as libralis</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes grave</i>. The oldest form of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">as</i> is that
which bears the figure of an animal (a bull,
ram, boar, or sow). The next and most common
form is that which has the two-faced
head of Janus on one side, and the prow of a
ship on the other (whence the expression
used by Roman boys in tossing up, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capita aut
navim</i>.) Pliny informs us, that in the time
of the first Punic war (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 264-241), in order
to meet the expenses of the state, this
weight of a pound was diminished, and asses
were struck of the same weight as the sextans
(that is, two ounces, or one-sixth of the
ancient weight); and that thus the republic
paid off its debts, gaining five parts in six;
that afterwards, in the second Punic war, in
the dictatorship of Q. Fabius Maximus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
217), asses of one ounce were made, and the
denarius was decreed to be equal to sixteen
asses, the republic thus gaining one half; but
that in military pay the denarius was always
given for ten asses; and that soon after, by
the Papirian law (about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 191), asses of
half an ounce were made. The value of the
as, of course, varied with its weight. Before
the reduction to two ounces, ten asses were
equal to the denarius = about 8½ pence English
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Denarius">Denarius</a></span>]. Therefore the as = 3·4
farthings. By the reduction the denarius
was made equal to sixteen asses; therefore
the as = 2⅛ farthings. The as was divided<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
into parts, which were named according to
the number of ounces they contained. They
were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deunx</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dextans</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dodrans</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septunx</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">semis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quincunx</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triens</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrans</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">teruncius</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sextans</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sescunx</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sescuncia</i>, and
uncia, consisting respectively of 11, 10, 9, 8,
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1½, and 1 ounces. Of these
divisions the following were represented by
coins; namely, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">semis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quincunx</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triens</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrans</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sextans</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uncia</i>. After the reduction
in the weight of the as, coins were
struck of the value of 2, 3, 4, and even 10
asses, which were called respectively <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dussis</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dupondius</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tressis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrussis</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decussis</i>.
Other multiples of the as were denoted by
words of similar formation, up to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centussis</i>,
100 asses; but most of them do not exist as
coins. In certain forms of expression, in
which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes</i> is used for money without specifying
the denomination, we must understand the
as. Thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deni aeris</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mille aeris</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decies aeris</i>,
mean respectively 10, 1000, 1,000,000 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">asses</i>.
The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">as</i> was used also for any whole
which was to be divided into equal parts;
and those parts were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unciae</i>. Thus
these words were applied not only to weight
and money, but to measures of length, surface,
and capacity, to inheritances, interest,
houses, farms, and many other things. Hence
the phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">haeres ex asse</i>, the heir to a whole
estate; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">haeres ex dodrante</i>, the heir to three-fourths.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">as</i> was also called in ancient
times <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">assarius</i> (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummus</i>), and in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ
ἀσσάριον</span>. According to Polybius, the assarius
was equal to half the obolus.</p>


<p id="Ascia">ASCĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκέπαρνον</span>), an adze. The annexed

The instrument at the bottom was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acisculus</i>, and was chiefly used by masons.</p>

<p id="Asclepieia">ASCLĒPIEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσκληπίεια</span>), the name of
festivals which were probably celebrated in
all places where temples of Asclepius (Aesculapius)
existed. The most celebrated, however,
was that of Epidaurus, which took place
every five years, and was solemnized with
contests of rhapsodists and musicians, and
with solemn processions and games.</p>


<p id="Ascoliasmus">ASCŌLĬASMUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσκωλιασμός</span>, the leaping
upon the leathern bag, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσκός</span>) was one of the
many kinds of amusements in which the
Athenians indulged during the Anthesteria
and other festivals in honour of Dionysus.
Having sacrificed a he-goat to the god, they
made a bag out of the skin, smeared it with
oil, and then tried to dance upon it.</p>

<p id="Asebeias">ĂSĔBEIAS GRĂPHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσεβείας γραφή</span>), one
of the many forms prescribed by the Attic
laws for the impeachment of impiety. Any
citizen not incapacitated by disfranchisement
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</span>) seems to have been a competent accuser;
and citizens, resident aliens, and
strangers, were equally liable to the accusation.
Whether the causes were brought into
the areiopagus, or the common heliastic
court, seems to have been determined by the
form of action adopted by the prosecutor, or
the degree of competency to which the areiopagus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>

<p id="Asiarchae">ĂSĬARCHAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσιάρχαι</span>) were, in the Roman
province of Asia, the chief presidents of
the religious rites, whose office it was to exhibit
games and theatrical amusements every
year, in honour of the gods and the Roman
emperor, at their own expense, like the Roman
aediles. They were ten in number,
selected annually by the different towns of
Asia, and approved of by the Roman proconsul;
of these, one was the chief asiarch, and
frequently, but not always, resided at Ephesus.</p>


<p id="Assarius">ASSĀRĬUS NUMMUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As_c">As</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Assertor">ASSERTOR, or ADSERTOR, contains the
same root as the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adserere</i>, which, when
coupled with the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manu</i>, signifies to lay
hold of a thing, to draw it towards one. Hence
the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adserere in libertatem</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liberali
adserere manu</i>, applies to him who lays his
hand on a person reputed to be a slave, and
<em>asserts</em>, or maintains his freedom. The person
who thus maintained the freedom of a reputed
slave was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adsertor</i>. The person whose
freedom was thus claimed was said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adsertus</i>.
The expressions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liberalis causa</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liberalis manus</i>, which occur in connection
with the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adserere</i>, will easily be understood
from what has been said. Sometimes
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adserere</i> alone was used as equivalent
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adserere in libertatem</i>. The expression
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">asserere in servitutem</i>, to claim a person
as a slave, occurs in Livy.</p>


<p id="Assessor">ASSESSOR, or ADSESSOR, literally one
who sits by the side of another. Since the
consuls, praetors, governors of provinces,
and the judices, were often imperfectly acquainted
with the law and forms of procedure,
it was necessary that they should
have the aid of those who had made the law
their study. The assessors sat on the tribunal
with the magistrate. Their advice or aid
was given during the proceedings as well as
at other times, but they never pronounced a
judicial sentence.</p>

<p id="Astragalus">ASTRĂGĂLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστράγαλος</span>), literally, that
particular bone in the ankles of certain quadrupeds,
which the Greeks, as well as the Romans,
used for dice and other purposes.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Talus">Talus</a>.</span>] In architecture it signifies a certain
moulding (the astragal) which seems to have
derived its name from its resemblance to a
string or chain of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tali</i>, and it is in fact always
used in positions where it seems intended to
bind together the parts to which it is applied.
It belongs properly to the more highly decorated
forms of the Ionic order, in which it
appears as a lower edging to the larger mouldings,
especially the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">echinus</i> (ovolo), particularly
in the capital, as shown in the following

<p id="Astrateias">ASTRĂTEIAS GRĂPHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστρατείας
γραφή</span>), the accusation instituted at Athens
against persons who failed to appear among
the troops after they had been enrolled for a
campaign by the generals. The defendant, if
convicted, incurred disfranchisement (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</span>)
both in his own person and that of his descendants.</p>


<p id="Astrologia">ASTRŎLŎGĬA, astrology. A belief very
early arose, which still prevails unshaken in
the East, that a close connection subsisted
between the position and movements of the
heavenly bodies and the fate of man. Few
doubted that the destiny of a child might be
predicted with certainty by those who were
skilled to interpret the position of the stars
at the moment of his birth, and that the result
of any undertaking might be foretold from
the aspect of the firmament when it was
commenced. Hence a numerous and powerful
class of men arose who were distinguished
by various designations. From the country
where their science was first developed, they
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chaldaei</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Babylonii</i>; from observing
the stars, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">astronomi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">astrologi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">planetarii</i>;
from employing diagrams such as
were used by geometricians, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mathematici</i>;
from determining the lot of man at his natal
hour, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genethliaci</i>; from prophesying the
consummation of his struggles, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποτελεσματικοί</span>;
while their art was known as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστρολογία</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετεωρολογία</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γενεθλιαλογία</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποτελεσματική</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ars Chaldaeorum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mathesis</i>, or, from
the tables they consulted, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πινακική</span>. Their
calculations were termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Babylonii numeri</i>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χαλδαίων μέθοδοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χαλδαίων ψηφίδες</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rationes
Chaldaicae</i>; their responses when consulted
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chaldaeorum monita</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chaldaeorum natalicia
praedicta</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Astrologorum praedicta</i>. The stars
and constellations to which attention was
chiefly directed were the planets and the
signs of the zodiac, some of which were supposed
to exert uniformly a benign influence
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθοποιοὶ ἀστέρες</span>), such as Venus, Jupiter,
Luna, Virgo, Libra, Taurus; others to be
uniformly malign (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κακοποιοὶ ἀστέρες</span>), such as
Saturnus, Mars, Scorpio, Capricornus; others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
to be doubtful (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκοινοι ἀστέρες</span>), such as
Mercurius. The exact period of birth (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hora
genitalis</i>) being the critical moment, the computations
founded upon it were styled <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένεσις</span>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genitura</i>), <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὡροσκόπος</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horoscopus</i>), or simply
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέμα</span>, and the star or stars in the ascendant
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sidus natalitium</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sidera natalitia</i>. Astrologers
seem to have found their way very early
into Italy. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 139 an edict was promulgated
by C. Cornelius Hispallus, at that time
praetor, by which the Chaldaeans were ordered
to quit Italy within ten days, and they
were again banished from the city in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 33,
by M. Agrippa, who was then aedile. Another
severe ordinance was levelled by Augustus
against this class, but the frequent occurrence
of such phrases as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">expulit et
mathematicos</span>,” “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulsis Italia mathematicis</span>,”
in the historians of the empire prove how
firm a hold these pretenders must have obtained
over the public mind, and how profitable
the occupation must have been which
could induce them to brave disgrace, and
sometimes a cruel death.</p>


<p id="Astynomi">ASTỸNŎMI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστυνόμοι</span>), or street-police
of Athens, were ten in number, five for the
city, and as many for the Peiraeeus. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">astynomi</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agoranomi</i> divided between
them most of the functions of the Roman
aediles. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Agoranomi">Agoranomi</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Asylum">ĂSῩLUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄσυλον</span>). In the Greek states
the temples, altars, sacred groves, and statues
of the gods, generally possessed the privilege
of protecting slaves, debtors, and criminals,
who fled to them for refuge. The
laws, however, do not appear to have recognised
the right of all such sacred places to
afford the protection which was claimed, but
to have confined it to a certain number of
temples, or altars, which were considered in
a more especial manner to have the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσυλία</span>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus asyli</i>. There were several places in
Athens which possessed this privilege; of
which the best known was the Theseium, or
temple of Theseus, in the city, near the gymnasium,
which was chiefly intended for the
protection of ill-treated slaves, who could
take refuge in this place, and compel their
masters to sell them to some other person.
In the time of Tiberius, the number of places
possessing the jus asyli in the Greek cities in
Greece and Asia Minor became so numerous,
as seriously to impede the administration of
justice; and, consequently, the senate, by the
command of the emperor, limited the jus
asyli to a few cities. The asylum, which
Romulus is said to have opened at Rome to
increase the population of the city, was a
place of refuge for the inhabitants of other
states, rather than a sanctuary for those who
had violated the laws of the city. In the
republican and early imperial times, a right
of asylum, such as existed in the Greek states,
does not appear to have been recognised by
the Roman law; but it existed under the
empire, and a slave could fly to the temples of
the gods, or the statues of the emperors, to
avoid the ill-usage of his master.</p>


<p id="Ateleia">ĂTĔLEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτέλεια</span>), immunity from public
burthens, was enjoyed at Athens by the
archons for the time being; by the descendants
of certain persons, on whom it had been
conferred as a reward for great services, as
in the case of Harmodius and Aristogeiton;
and by the inhabitants of certain foreign states.
It was of several kinds: it might be a general
immunity (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτέλεια ἁπάντων</span>); or a more special
exemption, as from custom-duties, from
the liturgies, or from providing sacrifices.</p>


<p id="Atellanae">ĀTELLĀNAE FĂBŬLAE were a species
of farce or comedy, so called from Atella, a
town of the Osci, in Campania. From this
circumstance, and from being written in the
Oscan dialect, they were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ludi
Osci</i>. These Atellane plays were not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetextatae</i>,
<em>i.e.</em> comedies in which magistrates and
persons of rank were introduced, nor <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabernariae</i>,
the characters in which were taken
from low life; they rather seem to have been
a union of high comedy and its parody.
They were also distinguished from the mimes
by the absence of low buffoonery and ribaldry,
being remarkable for a refined humour,
such as could be understood and appreciated
by educated people. They were not
performed by regular actors (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">histriones</i>), but
by Roman citizens of noble birth, who were
not on that account subjected to any degradation,
but retained their rights as citizens,
and might serve in the army. The Oscan or
Opican language, in which these plays were
written, was spread over the whole of the
south of Italy, and from its resemblance to
the Latin could easily be understood by the
more educated Romans.</p>


<p id="Athenaeum">ĂTHĒNAEUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀθήναιον</span>), a school (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludus</i>)
founded <ins class="corr" id="tn-46" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'by the Emperior'">
by the Emperor</ins> Hadrian at Rome,
for the promotion of literary and scientific
studies (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingenuarum artium</i>), and called
Athenaeum from the town of Athens, which
was still regarded as the seat of intellectual
refinement. The Athenaeum was situated on
the Capitoline hill. It was a kind of university,
with a staff of professors, for the
various branches of study. Besides the instruction
given by these magistri, poets, orators,
and critics were accustomed to recite
their compositions there, and these prelections
were sometimes honoured with the presence
of the emperors themselves. The Athenaeum
seems to have continued in high repute till
the fifth century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>


<p id="Athletae">ATHLĒTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀθληταί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀθλητῆρες</span>), persons
who contended in the public games of the
Greeks and Romans for prizes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἆθλα</span>, whence
the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀθληταί</span>), which were given to
those who conquered in contests of agility
and strength. The name was in the later
period of Grecian history, and among the
Romans, properly confined to those persons
who entirely devoted themselves to a course
of training which might fit them to excel in
such contests, and who, in fact, made athletic
exercises their profession. The athletae
differed, therefore, from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agonistae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγωνισταί</span>),
who only pursued gymnastic exercises
for the sake of improving their health
and bodily strength, and who, though they
sometimes contended for the prizes in the
public games, did not devote their whole
lives, like the athletae, to preparing for these
contests. Athletae were first introduced at
Rome, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 186, in the games exhibited by
M. Fulvius, on the conclusion of the Aetolian
war. Aemilius Paullus, after the conquest of
Perseus, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 167, is said to have exhibited
games at Amphipolis, in which athletae contended.
Under the Roman emperors, and
especially under Nero, who was passionately
fond of the Grecian games, the number of
athletae increased greatly in Italy, Greece,
and Asia Minor. Those athletae who conquered
in any of the great national festivals
of the Greeks were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hieronicae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερονῖκαι</span>),
and received the greatest honours and
rewards. Such a conqueror was considered
to confer honour upon the state to which he
belonged; he entered his native city through
a breach made in the walls for his reception,
in a chariot drawn by four white horses, and
went along the principal street of the city to
the temple of the guardian deity of the state.
Those games, which gave the conquerors the
right of such an entrance into the city, were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iselastici</i> (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσελαύνειν</span>). This
term was originally confined to the four great
Grecian festivals, the Olympian, Isthmian,
Nemean, and Pythian, but was afterwards
applied to other public games. In the Greek
states, the victors in these games not only
obtained the greatest glory and respect, but
also substantial rewards. They were generally
relieved from the payment of taxes, and
also enjoyed the first seat (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προεδρία</span>) in all
public games and spectacles. Their statues
were frequently erected at the cost of the
state, in the most frequented part of the city,
as the market-place, the gymnasia, and the
neighbourhood of the temples. At Athens,
according to a law of Solon, the conquerors in
the Olympic games were rewarded with a
prize of 500 drachmae; and the conquerors
in the Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian, with
one of 100 drachmae; and at Sparta they had
the privilege of fighting near the person of
the king. The privileges of the athletae were
secured, and in some respects increased, by
the Roman emperors. The term athletae,
though sometimes applied metaphorically to
other combatants, was properly limited to
those who contended for the prize in the five
following contests:&mdash;1. <em>Running</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρόμος</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cursus</i>). [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Stadium">Stadium</a>.</span>] 2. <em>Wrestling</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάλη</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucta</i>). 3. <em>Boxing</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυγμή</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pugilatus</i>). 4. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pentathlum</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πένταθλον</span>), or, as the Romans
called it, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinquertium</i>. 5. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pancratium</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παγκράτιον</span>). Of all these an account is given
in separate articles. Great attention was
paid to the training of the athletae. They
were generally trained in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palaestrae</i>,
which, in the Grecian states, were distinct
places from the gymnasia. Their exercises
were superintended by the gymnasiarch, and
their diet was regulated by the aliptes.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aliptae">Aliptae</a>.</span>]&mdash;The athletae were accustomed
to contend naked. In the descriptions of the
games given in the Iliad, the combatants are
represented with a girdle about their loins;
and the same practice, as we learn from
Thucydides, anciently prevailed at the
Olympic games, but was discontinued afterwards.</p>


<p id="Atimia">ĂTĪMĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</span>), the forfeiture of a man’s
civil rights at Athens. It was either total or
partial. A man was totally deprived of his
rights, both for himself and for his descendants
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καθάπαξ ἄτιμος</span>), when he was convicted
of murder, theft, false witness, partiality
as arbiter, violence offered to a magistrate,
and so forth. This highest degree of
atimia excluded the person affected by it from
the forum, and from all public assemblies;
from the public sacrifices, and from the law
courts; or rendered him liable to immediate
imprisonment, if he was found in any of these
places. It was either temporary or perpetual,
and either accompanied or not with
confiscation of property. Partial atimia only
involved the forfeiture of some few rights, as,
for instance, the right of pleading in court.
Public debtors were suspended from their
civic functions till they discharged their debt
to the state. People who had once become
altogether atimi were very seldom restored to
their lost privileges. The converse term to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimia</i> was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epitimia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτιμία</span>).</p>


<p id="Atlantes">ATLANTES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτλαντες</span>) and TĔLĂMŌNES
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελαμῶνες</span>), terms used in architecture, the
former by the Greeks, the latter by the Romans,
to designate those male figures which
are sometimes fancifully used, like the female
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caryatides</i>, in place of columns. Both words
are derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τλῆναι</span>, and the former evidently
refers to the fable of Atlas, who supported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the vault of heaven, the latter <em>perhaps</em>
to the strength of the Telamonian Ajax.</p>

<p id="Atramentum">ĀTRĀMENTUM, a term applicable to any
black colouring substance, for whatever purpose
it may be used, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melan</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέλαν</span>)
of the Greeks. There were, however, three
principal kinds of atramentum: one called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">librarium</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptorium</i> (in Greek, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφικὸν
μέλαν</span>), writing-ink; another called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sutorium</i>,
which was used by the shoemakers for dyeing
leather; the third <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tectorium</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pictorium</i>,
which was used by painters for some purposes,
apparently as a sort of varnish. The
inks of the ancients seem to have been more
durable than our own; they were thicker
and more unctuous, in substance and durability
more resembling the ink now used by
printers. An inkstand was discovered at
Herculaneum, containing ink as thick as oil,
and still usable for writing. The ancients
used inks of various colours. Red ink, made
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minium</i> or vermilion, was used for writing
the titles and beginning of books. So also
was ink made of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rubrica</i>, “red ochre;” and
because the headings of <em>laws</em> were written
with rubrica, the word rubric came to be
used for the civil law. So <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">album</i>, a white or
whited table, on which the praetors’ edicts
were written, was used in a similar way. A
person devoting himself to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">album</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rubrica</i>,
was a person devoting himself to the law.

<p id="Atrium">ĀTRĬUM (called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλή</span> by the Greeks and
by Virgil, and also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεσαύλιον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίστυλον</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίστῳον</span>) is used in a distinctive as well as
collective sense, to designate a particular part
in the private houses of the Romans [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Domus">Domus</a></span>],
and also a class of public buildings, so called
from their general resemblance in construction
to the atrium of a private house. An
atrium of the latter description was a building
by itself, resembling in some respects the
open basilica [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Basilica">Basilica</a></span>], but consisting of
three sides. Such was the Atrium Publicum
in the capitol, which, Livy informs us, was
struck with lightning, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 216. It was at
other times attached to some temple or other
edifice, and in such case consisted of an
open area and surrounding portico in front
of the structure. Several of these buildings
are mentioned by the ancient historians, two
of which were dedicated to the same goddess,
Libertas. The most celebrated, as well as
the most ancient, was situated on the Aventine
Mount. In this atrium there was a
tabularium, where the legal tablets (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae</i>)
relating to the censors were preserved. The
other Atrium Libertatis was in the neighbourhood
of the Forum Caesaris, and was
immediately behind the Basilica Paulli or
Aemilia.</p>


<p id="Auctio">AUCTĬO signifies generally “an increasing,
an enhancement,” and hence the name is applied
to a public sale of goods, at which persons
bid against one another. The sale was
sometimes conducted by an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">argentarius</i>, or by
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister auctionis</i>; and the time, place,
and conditions of sale, were announced either
by a public notice (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">album</i>, &amp;c.), or by
a crier (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praeco</i>). The usual phrases to express
the giving notice of a sale were, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctionem
proscribere, praedicare</i>; and to determine
on a sale, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctionem constituere</i>. The
purchasers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emtores</i>), when assembled, were
sometimes said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad tabulam adesse</i>. The
phrases signifying to bid are, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liceri</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">licitari</i>,
which was done either by word of mouth, or
by such significant hints as are known to all
people who have attended an auction. The
property was said to be knocked down (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">addici</i>)
to the purchaser. The praeco, or crier,
seems to have acted the part of the modern
auctioneer, so far as calling out the biddings,
and amusing the company. Slaves, when
sold by auction, were placed on a stone, or
other elevated thing, as is the case when
slaves are sold in the United States of North
America; and hence the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo de lapide
emtus</i>. It was usual to put up a spear
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta</i>) in auctions; a symbol derived, it is
said, from the ancient practice of selling under
a spear the booty acquired in war.</p>


<p id="Auctor">AUCTOR, a word which contains the same
element as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aug-eo</i>, and signifies generally one
who enlarges, confirms, or gives to a thing
its completeness and efficient form. The
numerous technical significations of the word
are derivable from this general notion. As he
who gives to a thing that which is necessary
for its completeness may in this sense be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
viewed as the chief actor or doer, the word
auctor is also used in the sense of one who
originates or proposes a thing; but this cannot
be viewed as its primary meaning. Accordingly,
the word auctor, when used in
connection with lex or senatus consultum,
often means him who originates and proposes.&mdash;The
expressions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores fiunt</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores facti</i>, have given rise to much
discussion. In the earlier periods of the Roman
state, the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres</i> was equivalent to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patricii</i>; in the later period, when the patricians
had lost all importance as a political
body, the term patres signified the senate.
Hence some ambiguity has arisen. The expression
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores fiunt</i>, when used of
the early period of Rome, means that the
determinations of the populus in the comitia
centuriata were confirmed by the patricians
in the comitia curiata. Till the time of Servius
Tullius there were only the comitia curiata,
and this king first established the
comitia centuriata, in which the plebs also
voted, and consequently it was not till after
this time that the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores fiunt</i>
could be properly applied. Livy, however,
uses it of an earlier period. The comitia
curiata first elected the king, and then by
another vote conferred upon him the imperium.
The latter was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex curiata de
imperio</i>, an expression not used by Livy,
who employs instead the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores
fiunt</i> (Liv. i. 17, 22, 32).&mdash;After the
exile of the last Tarquin, the patres, that is
the patricians, had still the privilege of confirming
at the comitia curiata the vote of the
comitia centuriata, that is, they gave to it
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patrum auctoritas</i>; or, in other words,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres</i> were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctores facti</i>. In the
fifth century of the city a change was made.
By one of the laws of the plebeian dictator Q.
Publilius Philo, it was enacted that in the
case of leges to be enacted at the comitia centuriata,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres</i> should be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctores</i>, that is,
the curiae should give their assent before the
vote of the comitia centuriata. By a lex
Maenia of uncertain date the same change
was made as to elections.&mdash;But both during
the earlier period and afterwards no business
could be brought before the comitia without
first receiving the sanction of the senate; and
accordingly the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores fiunt</i>
came now to be applied to the approval of
a measure by the senate before it was confirmed
by the votes of the people. This preliminary
approval was also termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus
auctoritas</i>.&mdash;When the word auctor is applied
to him who recommends but does not
originate a legislative measure, it is equivalent
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suasor</i>. Sometimes both auctor and
suasor are used in the same sentence, and the
meaning of each is kept distinct. With reference
to dealings between individuals,
auctor has the sense of owner. In this sense
auctor is the seller (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venditor</i>), as opposed to
the buyer (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emtor</i>): and hence we have the
phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a malo auctore emere</i>. Auctor is also
used generally to express any person under
whose authority any legal act is done. In
this sense, it means a tutor who is appointed
to aid or advise a woman on account of the
infirmity of her sex.</p>

[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Gladiatores">Gladiatores</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Auctoritas">AUCTŌRĬTAS. The technical meanings
of this word correlate with those of auctor.
The auctoritas senatus was not a senatus-consultum;
it was a measure, incomplete in
itself, which received its completion by some
other authority. Auctoritas, as applied to
property, is equivalent to legal ownership,
being a correlation of auctor.</p>


<p id="Auditorium">AUDĪTŌRĬUM, as the name implies, is
any place for hearing. It was the practice
among the Romans for poets and others to
read their compositions to their friends, who
were sometimes called the auditorium; but
the word was also used to express any place
in which any thing was heard, and under the
empire it was applied to a court of justice.
Under the republic the place for all judicial
proceedings was the comitium and the forum.
But for the sake of shelter and convenience
it became the practice to hold courts in the
Basilicae, which contained halls, which were
also called auditoria. It is first under M.
Aurelius that the auditorium principis is
mentioned, by which we must understand a
hall or room in the imperial residence; and
in such a hall Septimius Severus and the
later emperors held their regular sittings
when they presided as judges. The latest
jurists use the word generally for any place
in which justice was administered.</p>


<p id="Augur">AUGUR, AUGŬRĬUM; AUSPEX, AUSPĬCĬUM.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augur</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspex</i> meant a diviner
by birds, but came in course of time, like
the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰωνός</span>, to be applied in a more extended
sense: his art was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">augurium</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicium</i>. Plutarch relates that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">augures</i>
were originally termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspices</i>. The
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspex</i> was supplanted by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">augur</i>, but
the scientific term for the observation continued
on the contrary to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicium</i> and
not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">augurium</i>. By Greek writers on Roman
affairs, the augurs are called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰωνοπόλοι</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰωνοσκόποι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰωνισταί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἐπ’ οἰωνοῖς ἱερεῖς</span>.
The belief that the flight of birds gave some
intimation of the will of the gods seems to
have been prevalent among many nations of
antiquity, and was common to the Greeks, as
well as the Romans; but it was only among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the latter people that it was reduced to a
complete system, governed by fixed rules,
and handed down from generation to generation.
In Greece, the oracles supplanted the
birds, and the future was learnt from Apollo
and other gods, rarely from Zeus, who possessed
very few oracles in Greece. The contrary
was the case at Rome: it was from
Jupiter that the future was learnt, and the
birds were regarded as his messengers. It
must be remarked in general, that the Roman
auspices were essentially of a practical nature;
they gave no information respecting the
course of future events, they did not inform
men <em>what was to happen</em>, but simply taught
them <em>what they were to do, or not to do</em>;
they assigned no reason for the decision of
Jupiter&mdash;they simply announced, yes or no.
The words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">augurium</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicium</i> came to
be used in course of time to signify the observation
of various kinds of signs. They
were divided into five sorts: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex caelo</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex
avibus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex tripudiis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex quadrupedibus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex diris</i>.
Of these, the last three formed no part of the
ancient auspices.&mdash;1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex caelo.</i> This included
the observation of the various kinds of
thunder and lightning, and was regarded as
the most important, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maximum auspicium</i>.
Whenever it was reported by a person authorised
to take the auspices, that Jupiter thundered
or lightened, the comitia could not be
held.&mdash;2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex avibus.</i> It was only a few
birds which could give auguries among the
Romans. They were divided into two classes:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oscines</i>, those which gave auguries by singing,
or their voice, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alites</i>, those which
gave auguries by their flight. To the former
class belonged the raven (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corvus</i>) and the
crow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornix</i>), the first of these giving a
favourable omen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicium ratum</i>) when it
appeared on the right, the latter, on the contrary,
when it was seen on the left: likewise
the owl (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noctua</i>) and the hen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gallina</i>). To
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aves alites</i> belonged first of all the eagle
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquila</i>), which is called pre-eminently the
bird of Jupiter (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jovis ales</i>), and next the vulture
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vultur</i>). Some birds were included both
among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oscines</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alites</i>: such were
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus Martius</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Feronius</i>, and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parra</i>. These were the principal birds consulted
in the auspices. When the birds favoured
an undertaking, they were said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">addicere</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">admittere</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundare</i>, and were then
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">addictivae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">admissivae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundae</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praepetes</i>: when unfavourable they were said
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abdicere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">refragari</i>, &amp;c., and were
then called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adversae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alterae</i>. The birds
which gave unfavourable omens were termed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funebres</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inhibitae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lugubres</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">malae</i>, &amp;c., and
such auspices were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clivia</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clamatoria</i>.&mdash;3.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex tripudiis.</i> These auspices
were taken from the feeding of chickens, and
were especially employed on military expeditions.
The chickens were kept in a cage,
under care of a person called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pullarius</i>; and
when the auspices were to be taken, the
pullarius opened the cage and threw to the
chickens pulse or a kind of soft cake. If
they refused to come out or to eat, or uttered
a cry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occinerent</i>), or beat their wings, or
flew away, the signs were considered unfavourable.
On the contrary, if they ate
greedily, so that something fell from their
mouth and struck the earth, it was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tripudium solistimum</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tripudium</i> quasi <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terripavium</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solistimum</i>, from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solum</i>, according to
the ancient writers), and was held a favourable
sign.&mdash;4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex quadrupedibus.</i> Auguries
could also be taken from four-footed animals;
but these formed no part of the original
science of the augurs, and were never employed
by them in taking auspices on behalf
of the state, or in the exercise of their art
properly so called. They must be looked
upon simply as a mode of private divination.
When a fox, a wolf, a horse, a dog, or any
other kind of quadruped ran across a person’s
path or appeared in an unusual place, it
formed an augury.&mdash;5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex diris</i>, sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signis</i>.
Under this head was included every kind of
augury which does not fall under any of the
four classes mentioned above, such as sneezing,
stumbling, and other accidental things.
There was an important augury of this kind
connected with the army, which was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex acuminibus</i>, that is, the flames appearing
at the points of spears or other weapons.
The ordinary manner of taking the auspices,
properly so called (i.e. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex caelo</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex avibus</i>),
was as follows: The person who was to take
them first marked out with a wand (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lituus</i>)
a division in the heavens called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tescum</i>, within which he intended to make
his observations. The station where he was
to take the auspices was also separated by a
solemn formula from the rest of the land,
and was likewise called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tescum</i>.
He then proceeded to pitch a tent in it (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabernaculum
capere</i>), and this tent again was also
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum</i>, or, more accurately, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum
minus</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Templum">Templum</a>.</span>] Within the walls of
Rome, or, more properly speaking, within
the pomoerium, there was no occasion to select
a spot and pitch a tent on it, as there
was a place on the Arx on the summit of the
Capitoline hill, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Auguraculum</i>, which
had been consecrated once for all for this purpose.
In like manner there was in every
Roman camp a place called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">augurale</i>, which
answered the same purpose; but on all other
occasions a place had to be consecrated, and
a tent to be pitched, as, for instance, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Campus Martius, when the comitia centuriata
were to be held. The person who was then
taking the auspices waited for the favourable
signs to appear; but it was necessary during
this time that there should be no interruption
of any kind whatsoever (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silentium</i>), and hence
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silentium</i> was used in a more extended
sense to signify the absence of every
thing that was faulty. Every thing, on the
contrary, that rendered the auspices invalid
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitium</i>; and hence we constantly
read in Livy and other writers of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitio magistratus
creati</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitio lex lata</i>, &amp;c. The watching
for the auspices was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectio</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">servare de coelo</i>, the declaration of what was
observed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuntiatio</i>, or, if they were unfavourable,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obnuntiatio</i>. In the latter case, the
person who took the auspices seems usually
to have said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alio die</i>, by which the business
in hand, whether the holding of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia</i>
or any thing else, was entirely stopped.&mdash;In
ancient times no one but a patrician could
take the auspices. Hence the possession of
the auspices (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habere auspicia</i>) is one of the
most distinguished prerogatives of the patricians;
they are said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penes patrum</i>, and
are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia patrum</i>. It would further
appear that every patrician might take the
auspices; but here a distinction is to be observed
between the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia privata</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia
publica</i>. One of the most frequent
occasions on which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia privata</i> were
taken, was in case of a marriage: and this
was one great argument used by the patricians
against <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">connubium</i> between themselves
and the plebeians, as it would occasion, they
urged, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perturbationem auspiciorum publicorum
privatorumque</i>. In taking these private
auspices, it would appear that any patrician
was employed who knew how to form <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templa</i>
and was acquainted with the art of augury.
The case, however, was very different with
respect to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia publica</i>, generally
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia</i> simply, or those which concerned
the state. The latter could only be
taken by the persons who represented the
state, and who acted as mediators between
the gods and the state; for though all the
patricians were eligible for taking the auspices,
yet it was only the magistrates who
were in actual possession of them. In case,
however, there was no patrician magistrate,
the auspices became vested in the whole body
of the patricians (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia ad patres redeunt</i>),
who had recourse to an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interregnum</i> for the
renewal of them, and for handing them over
in a perfect state to the new magistrates:
hence we find the expressions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repetere de integro
auspicia</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">renovare per interregnum
auspicia</i>.&mdash;The distinction between the duties
of the magistrates and the augurs in taking
the auspices is one of the most difficult points
connected with this subject, but perhaps a
satisfactory solution of these difficulties may
be found by taking an historical view of the
question. We are told not only that the
kings were in possession of the auspices, but
that they themselves were acquainted with
the art and practised it. Romulus is stated
to have appointed three augurs, but only as
his assistants in taking the auspices, a fact
which it is important to bear in mind. Their
dignity gradually increased in consequence of
their being employed at the inauguration of
the kings, and also in consequence of their
becoming the preservers and depositaries of
the science of augury. Formed into a collegium,
they handed down to their successors
the various rules of the science, while the
kings, and subsequently the magistrates of
the republic, were liable to change. Their
duties thus became two-fold, to assist the magistrates
in taking up auspices, and to preserve
a scientific knowledge of the art. As
the augurs were therefore merely the assistants
of the magistrates, they could not take
the auspices without the latter, though the
magistrates on the contrary could dispense
with their assistance. At the same time it
must be borne in mind, that as the augurs
were the interpreters of the science, they
possessed the right of declaring whether the
auspices were valid or invalid. They thus
possessed in reality a veto upon every important
public transaction; and they frequently
exercised this power as a political
engine to vitiate the election <ins class="corr" id="tn-51" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'of each parties'">
of such parties</ins> as were unfavourable to the enclusive privileges
of the patricians. But although the
augurs could declare that there was some
fault in the auspices, yet, on the other hand,
they could not, by virtue of their office, declare
that any unfavourable sign had appeared
to them, since it was not to them that the
auspices were sent. Thus we are told that
the augurs did not possess the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectio</i>. This
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectio</i> was of two kinds, one more extensive
and the other more limited. In the one case
the person who exercised it could put a stop
to the proceedings of any other magistrate by
his obnuntiatio: this was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectio et
nuntiatio</i> (perhaps also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectio cum nuntiatione</i>),
and belonged only to the highest magistrates,
the consuls, dictators, interreges,
and, with some modifications, to the praetors.
In the other case, the person who took the
auspices only exercised the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectio</i> in reference
to the duties of his own office, and could
not interfere with any other magistrate: this
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectio sine nuntiatione</i>, and belonged
to the other magistrates, the censors,
aediles, and quaestors. Now as the augurs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
did not possess the auspices, they consequently
could not possess the spectio (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habere
spectionem</i>); but as the augurs were constantly
employed by the magistrates to take
the auspices, they <em>exercised</em> the spectio, though
they did not <em>possess</em> it in virtue of their office.
When they were employed by the magistrates
in taking the auspices, they possessed the
right of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuntiatio</i>, and thus had the
power, by the declaration of unfavourable
signs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obnuntiatio</i>), to put a stop to all important
public transactions.&mdash;The auspices
were not conferred upon the magistrates in
any special manner. It was the act of their
election which made them the recipients of
the auspices, since the comitia, in which they
were appointed to their office, were held <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicato</i>,
and consequently their appointment
was regarded as ratified by the gods. The
auspices, therefore, passed immediately into
their hands upon the abdication of their predecessors
in office.&mdash;The auspices belonging
to the different magistrates were divided into
two classes, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia maxima</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">majora</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minora</i>. The former, which belonged
originally to the kings, passed over to the
consuls, censors, and praetors, and likewise
to the extraordinary magistrates, the dictators,
interreges, and consular tribunes. The
quaestors and the curule aediles, on the contrary,
had only the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia minora</i>.&mdash;It was
a common opinion in antiquity that a college
of three augurs was appointed by Romulus,
answering to the number of the early tribes,
the Ramnes, Tities, and Lucerenses, but the
accounts vary respecting their origin and
number. At the passing of the Ogulnian
law (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 300) the augurs were four in number.
This law increased the number of pontiffs
to eight, by the addition of four plebeians,
and that of the augurs to nine by the addition
of five plebeians. The number of nine
augurs lasted down to the dictatorship of
Sulla, who increased them to fifteen, a multiple
of the original three, probably with a
reference to the early tribes. A sixteenth
was added by Julius Caesar after his return
from Egypt. The members of the college of
augurs possessed the right of self-election
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cooptatio</i>) until <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 103, the year of the
Domitian law. By this law it was enacted
that vacancies in the priestly colleges should
be filled up by the votes of a minority of the
tribes, <em>i.e.</em> seventeen out of thirty-five chosen
by lot. The Domitian law was repealed by
Sulla <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 81, but again restored <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63,
during the consulship of Cicero, by the tribune
T. Annius Labienus, with the support
of Caesar. It was a second time abrogated
by Antony <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 44; whether again restored
by Hirtius and Pansa in their general annulment
of the acts of Antony, seems uncertain.
The emperors possessed the right of electing
augurs at pleasure. The augurs were elected
for life, and even if capitally convicted, never
lost their sacred character. When a vacancy
occurred, the candidate was nominated by
two of the elder members of the college, the
electors were sworn, and the new member
was then solemnly inaugurated. On such
occasion there was always a splendid banquet
given, at which all the augurs were expected
to be present. The only distinction in the
college was one of age; an elder augur
always voted before a younger, even if the
latter filled one of the higher offices in the
state. The head of the college was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister collegii</i>. As insignia of their office
the augurs wore the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trabea</i>, or public dress,
and carried in their hand the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lituus</i> or curved
wand. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lituus">Lituus</a>.</span>] On the coins of the Romans,
who filled the office of augur, we constantly
find the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lituus</i>, and along with it, not
unfrequently, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capis</i>, an earthen vessel
which was used by them in sacrifices. The
science of the augurs was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus augurum</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus augurium</i>, and was preserved in books
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libri augurales</i>), which are frequently mentioned
in the ancient writers. The expression
for consulting the augurs was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">referre ad
augures</i>, and their answers were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decreta</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">responsa augurum</i>. The science of
augury had greatly declined in the time of
Cicero; and although he frequently deplores
its neglect in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Divinatione</i>, yet neither
he nor any of the educated classes appears to
have had any faith in it.</p>

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augustalia</i>, sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">certamina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludicra</i>), games
celebrated in honour of Augustus, at Rome
and in other parts of the Roman empire.
After the battle of Actium, a quinquennial
festival was instituted; and the birthday of
Augustus, as well as that on which the victory
was announced at Rome, were regarded
as festival days. It was not, however, till
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 11 that the festival on the birthday of
Augustus was formally established by a decree
of the senate, and it is this festival<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
which is usually meant when the Augustales
or Augustalia are mentioned. It was celebrated
iv. Id. Octobr. At the death of Augustus,
this festival assumed a more solemn
character, was added to the Fasti, and celebrated
to his honour as a god. It was henceforth
exhibited annually in the circus, at first
by the tribunes of the plebs, at the commencement
of the reign of Tiberius, but afterwards
by the praetor peregrinus.&mdash;(2) The
name of two classes of priests, one at Rome
and the other in the municipia. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augustales</i>
at Rome, properly called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sodales Augustales</i>,
were an order of priests instituted by
Tiberius to attend to the worship of Augustus
and the Julia gens. They were chosen by
lot from among the principal persons of
Rome, and were twenty-one in number, to
which were added Tiberius, Drusus, Claudius,
and Germanicus, as members of the imperial
family. They were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacerdotes Augustales</i>,
and sometimes simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augustales</i>.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augustales</i> in the municipia are supposed
by most modern writers to have been a class
of priests selected by Augustus from the libertini
to attend to the religions rites connected
with the worship of the Lares, which that
emperor was said to have put up in places
where two or more ways met; but there are
good reasons for thinking that they were instituted
in imitation of the Augustales at
Rome, and for the same object, namely, to
attend to the worship of Augustus. They
formed a collegium and were appointed by
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decuriones</i>, or senate of the municipia.
The six principal members of the college were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seviri</i>, a title which seems to have been
imitated from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seviri</i> in the equestrian
order at Rome.</p>


<p id="Augustus">AUGUSTUS, a name bestowed upon Octavianus
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 27, by the senate and the Roman
people. It was a word used in connection
with religion, and designated a person as
sacred and worthy of worship; hence the
Greek writers translate it by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σεβαστός</span>. It
was adopted by all succeeding emperors, as if
descended, either by birth or adoption, from
the first emperor of the Roman world. The
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augusta</i> was frequently bestowed
upon females of the imperial family; but
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augustus</i> belonged exclusively to the reigning
emperor till towards the end of the second
century of the Christian aera, when M. Aurelius
and L. Verus both received this surname.
From this time we frequently find
two or even a greater number of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augusti</i>.
From the time of Probus the title became
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perpetuus Augustus</i>, and from Philippus or
Claudius Gothicus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">semper Augustus</i>, the latter
of which titles was borne by the so-called Roman
emperors in Germany. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Caesar">Caesar</a>.</span>]</p>

<p id="Aurum">AURUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσός</span>), gold. Gold was scarce
in Greece. The chief places from which the
Greeks procured their gold were India, Arabia,
Armenia, Colchis, and Troas. It was found
mixed with the sands of the Pactolus and
other rivers. Almost the only method of
purifying gold, known to the ancients, seems
to have been that of grinding and then roasting
it, and by this process they succeeded in
getting it very pure. This is what we are to
understand by the phrase <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσίον ἄπεφθον</span> in
Thucydides, and by the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obrussa</i> in
Pliny. The art of gilding was known to the
Greeks from the earliest times of which we
have any information. The time when gold
was first coined at Athens is very uncertain,
but on the whole it appears most probable
that gold money was not coined there, or in
Greece Proper generally, till the time of Alexander
the Great, if we except a solitary issue
of debased gold at Athens in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 407. But
from a very early period the Asiatic nations,
and the Greek cities of Asia Minor and the
adjacent islands, as well as Sicily and Cyrene,
possessed a gold coinage, which was more or
less current in Greece. Herodotus says that
the Lydians were the first who coined gold,
and the stater of Croesus appears to have
been the earliest gold coin known to the
Greeks. The Daric was a Persian coin.
Staters of Cyzicus and Phocaea had a considerable
currency in Greece. There was a
gold coinage in Samos as early as the time of
Polycrates. The islands of Siphnos and Thasos,
which possessed gold mines, appear to
have had a gold coinage at an early period.
The Macedonian gold coinage came into circulation
in Greece in the time of Philip, and
continued in use till the subjection of Greece
to the Romans. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Dareicus">Daricus</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Stater">Stater</a></span>.] The
standard gold coin of Rome was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aureus
nummus</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">denarius aureus</i>, which, according
to Pliny, was first coined 62 years after
the first silver coinage [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Argentum">Argentum</a></span>], that is,
in the year 207 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The lowest denomination
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scrupulum</i>, which was made
equal to 20 sestertii. The weight of the
scrupulum was 18·06 grains. The annexed
cut represents a gold coin of 60 sestertii.
Pliny adds that afterwards aurei were coined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of 40 to the pound, which weight was diminished,
till under Nero they were 45 to the
pound. The average weight of the aurei of
Augustus, in the British Museum, is 121·26
grains: and as the weight was afterwards
diminished, we may take the average at 120
grains. The value of the aureus in terms of
the sovereign = 1<em>l.</em> 1<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em> and a little more
than a halfpenny. This is its value according
to the present worth of gold; but its
current value in Rome was different from
this, on account of the difference in the worth
of the metal. The aureus passed for 25 denarii;
therefore, the denarius being 8½<em>d.</em>, it
was worth 17<em>s.</em> 8½<em>d.</em> The ratio of the value
of gold to that of silver is given in the article
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Argentum">Argentum</a></span>. Alexander Severus coined pieces
of one-half and one-third of the aureus, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Semissis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tremissis</i>, after which time the
aureus was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solidus</i>. Constantine the
Great coined aurei of 72 to the pound; at
which standard the coin remained to the end
of the empire.</p>

<p id="Aurum_c">AURUM CŎRŌNĀRĬUM. When a general
in a Roman province had obtained a victory,
it was the custom for the cities in his own
provinces, and for those from the neighbouring
states, to send golden crowns to him,
which were carried before him in his triumph
at Rome. In the time of Cicero it appears
to have been usual for the cities of the provinces,
instead of sending crowns on occasion
of a victory, to pay money, which was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum coronarium</i>. This offering, which
was at first voluntary, came to be regarded
as a regular tribute, and was sometimes
exacted by the governors of the provinces,
even when no victory had been gained.</p>

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λουτρόν, βαλανεῖον</span>, also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balneae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balineae</i>),
a bath. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Balneum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balineum</i> signifies, in
its primary sense, a bath or bathing vessel,
such as most Romans possessed in their own
houses; and from that it came to mean the
chamber which contained the bath. When
the baths of private individuals became more
sumptuous, and comprised many rooms, the
plural <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balnea</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balinea</i> was adopted, which
still, in correct language, had reference only
to the baths of private persons. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Balneae</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balineae</i>, which have no singular number,
were the public baths. But this accuracy
of diction is neglected by many of the later
writers. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thermae</i> (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέρμη</span>, warmth)
means properly warm springs, or baths of
warm water, but was afterwards applied to
the structures in which the baths were placed,
and which were both hot and cold. There
was, however, a material distinction between
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balneae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thermae</i>, inasmuch as the
former was the term used under the republic,
and referred to the public establishments of
that age, which contained no appliances for
luxury beyond the mere convenience of hot
and cold baths, whereas the latter name was
given to those magnificent edifices which grew
up under the empire, and which comprised
within their range of buildings all the appurtenances
belonging to the Greek gymnasia, as
well as a regular establishment appropriated
for bathing.&mdash;Bathing was a practice familiar
to the Greeks of both sexes from the earliest
times. The artificial warm bath was taken
in a vessel called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">asaminthus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσάμινθος</span>) by
Homer, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puelus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύελος</span>) by the later
Greeks. It did not contain water itself, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
was only used for the bather to sit in, while
the warm water was poured over him. On
Greek vases, however, we never find anything
corresponding to a modern bath in which
persons can stand or sit; but there is always
a round or oval basin (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λουτήρ</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λουτήριον</span>),
resting on a stand, by the side of which those
who are bathing are standing undressed and
washing themselves. In the Homeric times
it was customary to take first a cold and
afterwards a warm bath; but in later times
it was the usual practice of the Greeks to
take first a warm or vapour, and afterwards
a cold bath. At Athens the frequent use of
the public baths, most of which were warm
baths (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βαλανεῖα</span>, called by Homer <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θερμὰ
λοετρά</span>), was regarded in the time of Socrates
and Demosthenes as a mark of luxury and
effeminacy. Accordingly, Phocion was said
to have never bathed in a public bath, and
Socrates to have used it very seldom. After
bathing both sexes anointed themselves, in
order that the skin might not be left harsh
and rough, especially after warm water. Oil
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔλαιον</span>) is the only ointment mentioned by
Homer, but in later times precious unguents
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μῦρα</span>) were used for this purpose. The bath
was usually taken before the principal meal
of the day (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεῖπνον</span>). The Lacedaemonians,
who considered warm water as enervating,
used two kinds of baths; namely, the cold
daily bath in the Eurotas, and a dry sudorific
bath in a chamber heated with warm air by
means of a stove, and from them the chamber
used by the Romans for a similar purpose
was termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laconicum</i>. A sudorific or vapour
bath (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυρία</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυριατήριον</span>) is mentioned
as early as the time of Herodotus. At what
period the use of the warm bath was introduced
among the Romans is not recorded;
but we know that Scipio had a warm bath in
his villa at Liternum, and the practice of
heating an apartment with warm air by flues
placed immediately under it, so as to produce
a vapour bath, is stated to have been invented
by Sergius Orata, who lived in the age of
Crassus, before the Marsic war. By the time
of Cicero the use of baths of warm water and
hot air had become common, and in his time
there were baths at Rome which were open
to the public upon payment of a small fee.
In the public baths at Rome the men and
women used originally to bathe in separate
sets of chambers; but under the empire it
became the common custom for both sexes to
bathe indiscriminately in the same bath.
This practice was forbidden by Hadrian and
M. Aurelius; and Alexander Severus prohibited
any baths, common to both sexes, from
being opened in Rome. The price of a bath
was a quadrant, the smallest piece of coined
money, from the age of Cicero downwards,
which was paid to the keeper of the bath
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balneator</i>). Children below a certain age
were admitted free. It was usual with the
Romans to take the bath after exercise, and
before the principal meal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coena</i>) of the day;
but the debauchees of the empire bathed also
after eating as well as before, in order to
promote digestion, and to acquire a new

  <div class="caption">Roman Bath. (Fresco from the Thermae of Titus.)</div>
</div>

<p>Upon quitting
the bath the Romans as well as the Greeks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>were anointed with oil. The Romans did not
content themselves with a single bath of hot
or cold water; but they went through a
course of baths in succession, in which the
agency of air as well as water was applied.
It is difficult to ascertain the precise order in
which the course was usually taken; but it
appears to have been a general practice to
close the pores, and brace the body after the
excessive perspiration of the vapour bath,
either by pouring cold water over the head,
or by plunging at once into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">piscina</i>. To
render the subjoined remarks more easily intelligible,
the preceding woodcut is inserted,
which is taken from a fresco painting upon
the walls of the thermae of Titus at Rome.
The chief parts of a Roman bath were as
follow:&mdash;1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apodyterium.</i> Here the bathers
were expected to take off their garments,
which were then delivered to a class of slaves,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capsarii</i>, whose duty it was to take
charge of them. These men were notorious
for dishonesty, and were leagued with all the
thieves of the city, so that they connived at
the robberies which they were placed to prevent.
There was probably an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Elaeothesium</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unctorium</i>, as appears from the preceding
cut, in connection with the apodyterium,
where the bathers might be anointed with
oil.&mdash;2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frigidarium</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cella Frigidaria</i>,
where the cold bath was taken. The cold
bath itself was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Natatio</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Natatorium</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piscina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Baptisterium</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Puteus</i>.&mdash;3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tepidarium</i>
would seem from the preceding cut
to have been a bathing room, for a person is
there apparently represented pouring water
over a bather. But there is good reason for
thinking that this was not the case. In most
cases the tepidarium contained no water at
all, but was a room merely heated with warm
air of an agreeable temperature, in order to
prepare the body for the great heat of the
vapour and warm baths, and upon returning
from the latter, to obviate the danger of a
too sudden transition to the open air.&mdash;4. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caldarium</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Concamerata Sudatio</i> contained
at one extremity the vapour bath (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laconicum</i>),
and at the other the warm bath (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balneum</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calda lavatio</i>), while the centre space
between the two ends was termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sudatio</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sudatorium</i>. In larger establishments the
vapour bath and warm bath were in two
separate cells, as we see in the preceding
cut: in such cases the former part <em>alone</em> was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">concamerata sudatio</i>. The whole rested
on a suspended pavement (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suspensura</i>), under
which was a fire (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hypocaustum</i>), so that the
flames might heat the whole apartment. (See
cut.) <span id="Calida">The</span> warm water bath (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balneum</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calda lavatio</i>), which is also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">piscina</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calida piscina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">labrum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solium</i>, appears
to have been a capacious marble vase, sometimes
standing upon the floor, like that in the
preceding cut, and sometimes either partly
elevated above the floor, as it was at Pompeii,
or entirely sunk into it. After having gone,
through the regular course of perspiration,
the Romans made use of instruments called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strigiles</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strigles</i>, to scrape off the perspiration.</p>

  <div class="caption">Strigil. (From a Relief at Athens.)</div>

<p>The strigil was also used by the Greeks,
who called it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stlengis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στλεγγίς</span>) or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">xystra</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξύστρα</span>). The figure in the cut on <a href="#ill024a">p. 24</a> is
represented with a strigil in his hand. As
the strigil was not a blunt instrument, its
edge was softened by the application of oil,
which was dropped upon it from a small
vessel called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">guttus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i>, which had a
narrow neck, so as to discharge its contents
drop by drop, from whence the name is taken.</p>

</div>

<p>In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thermae</i>, spoken of above, the baths
were of secondary importance. They were a
Roman adaptation of the Greek gymnasium,
contained exedrae for the philosophers and
rhetoricians to lecture in, porticoes for the
idle, and libraries for the learned, and were
adorned with marbles, fountains, and shaded
walks and plantations. M. Agrippa, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
reign of Augustus, was the first who afforded
these luxuries to his countrymen, by bequeathing
to them the thermae and gardens which
he had erected in the Campus Martius. The
example set by Agrippa was followed by
Nero, and afterwards by Titus, the ruins of
whose thermae are still visible, covering a
vast extent, partly under ground and partly
above the Esquiline hill. Thermae were also
erected by Trajan, Caracalla, and Diocletian,
of the two last of which ample remains still
exist. Previously to the erection of these
establishments for the use of the population,
it was customary for those who sought the
favour of the people to give them a day’s
bathing free of expense. From thence it is
fair to infer that the quadrant paid for admission
into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balneae</i> was not exacted at the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thermae</i>, which, as being the works of the
emperors, would naturally be opened with
imperial generosity to all, and without any
charge.</p>


<p id="Balteus">BALTĔUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελαμών</span>), a belt, a shoulder
belt, was used to suspend the sword. See
the figs. on <a href="#ill041">p. 41</a>. In the Homeric times the
Greeks used a belt to support the shield. The
balteus was likewise employed to suspend
the quiver, and sometimes together with it
the bow. More commonly the belt, whether
employed to support the sword, the shield,
or the quiver, was made of leather, and was
frequently ornamented with gold, silver, and
precious stones. In a general sense <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balteus</i>
was applied not only to the belt which passed
over the shoulder, but also to the girdle
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cingulum</i>), which encompassed the waist.
In architecture, Vitruvius applies the term
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Baltei</i> to the bands surrounding the volute
on each side of an Ionic capital. Other
writers apply it to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praecinctiones</i> of an
amphitheatre. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Barathron">BĂRATHRON (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάραθρον</span>), also called <span class="smcap">Orugma</span>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄρυγμα</span>), a deep cavern or chasm, like
the Ceadas at Sparta, behind the Acropolis at
Athens, into which criminals were thrown.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ceadas">Ceadas</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Barba">BARBA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πώγων</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένειον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπήνη</span>), the beard.
The Greeks seem generally to have worn the
beard till the time of Alexander the Great;
and a thick beard was considered as a mark
of manliness. The Greek philosophers in
particular were distinguished by their long
beards as a sort of badge. The Romans in
early times wore the beard uncut, and the
Roman beards are said not to have been
shaved till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 300, when P. Ticinius Maena
brought over a barber from Sicily; and Pliny
adds, that the first Roman who is said to
have been shaved every day was Scipio
Africanus. His custom, however, was soon
followed, and shaving became a regular thing.
In the later times of the republic there were
many who shaved the beard only partially,
and trimmed it, so as to give it an ornamental
form; to them the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bene barbati</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">barbatuli</i> are applied. In the general way at
Rome, a long beard (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">barba promissa</i>) was
considered a mark of slovenliness and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">squalor</i>.
The first time of shaving was regarded as the
beginning of manhood, and the day on which
this took place was celebrated as a festival.
There was no particular time fixed for this
to be done. Usually, however, it was done
when the young Roman assumed the toga
virilis. The hair cut off on such occasions
was consecrated to some god. Thus Nero
put his up in a gold box, set with pearls, and
dedicated it to Jupiter Capitolinus. Under
the emperor Hadrian the beard began to
revive. Plutarch says that the emperor wore
it to hide some scars on his face. The practice
afterwards became common, and till the
time of Constantine the Great, the emperors
appear in busts and coins with beards. The
Romans let their beards grow in time of
mourning; the Greeks, on the other hand,
on such occasions shaved the beard close.</p>


<p id="Barbitus">BARBĬTUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάρβιτος</span>), or BARBĬTON
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάρβιτον</span>), a stringed instrument, the original
form of which is uncertain. Later
writers use it as synonymous with the lyra.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lyra">Lyra</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Bascauda">BASCAUDA, a British basket. This term,
which remains with very little variation in
the Welsh “basgawd” and the English
“basket,” was conveyed to Rome together
with the articles denoted by it.</p>


<p id="Basilica">BĂSĬLĬCA (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aedes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aula</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porticus</i>&mdash;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλική</span>,
also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">regia</i>), a building which served
as a court of law and an exchange, or place
of meeting for merchants and men of business.
The word was adopted from the Athenians,
whose second archon was styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">archon
basileus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων βασιλεύς</span>), and the tribunal
where he adjudicated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stoa basileius</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡ βασίλειος
στοά</span>), the substantive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aula</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porticus</i> in
Latin being omitted for convenience, and
the distinctive epithet converted into a substantive.
The first edifice of this description
at Rome was not erected until <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 182. It
was situated in the forum adjoining the curia,
and was denominated <ins class="corr" id="tn-57" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Basilica Portia, in'">
Basilica Porcia, in</ins> commemoration
of its founder, M. Porcius Cato.
Besides this there were twenty others erected
at different periods, within the city of Rome.
The forum, or, where there was more than
one, the one which was in the most frequented
and central part of the city, was always selected
for the site of a basilica; and hence it
is that the classic writers not unfrequently
use the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basilica</i> synonymously.
The ground plan of all these buildings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
is rectangular, and their width not more
than half, nor less than one-third of the
length. This area was divided into three
naves, consisting of a centre (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">media porticus</i>),
and two side aisles, separated from the centre
one, each by a single row of columns. At one
end of the centre aisle was the tribunal of the
judge, in form either rectangular or circular, as
is seen in the annexed plan of the basilica at
Pompeii. In the centre of the tribunal was
placed the curule chair of the praetor, and seats
for the judices and the advocates. The two side
aisles, as has been said, were separated from
the centre one by a row of columns, behind
each of which was placed a square pier or
pilaster (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parastata</i>), which supported the
flooring of an upper portico, similar to the
gallery of a modern church. The upper
gallery was in like manner decorated with
columns, of lower dimensions than those
below; and these served to support the roof,
and were connected with one another by a
parapet-wall or balustrade (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pluteus</i>), which
served as a defence against the danger of
falling over, and screened the crowd of loiterers
above (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub-basilicani</i>) from the people of
business in the area below. Many of these
edifices were afterwards used as Christian
churches, and many churches were built
after the model above described. Such churches
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basilicae</i>, which name they retain
to the present day, being still called at Rome
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basiliche</i>.</p>

<p id="Basterna">BASTERNA, a kind of litter (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lectica</i>) in
which women were carried in the time of the
Roman emperors. It appears to have resembled
the Lectica [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lectica">Lectica</a></span>] very closely; and
the only difference apparently was, that the
lectica was carried by slaves, and the basterna
by two mules.</p>

<p id="Bendideia">BENDĬDEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βενδίδεια</span>), a Thracian festival
in honour of the goddess Bendis, who is
said to be identical with the Grecian Artemis
and with the Roman Diana. The festival
was of a bacchanalian character. From
Thrace it was brought to Athens, where it
was celebrated in the Peiraeeus, on the 19th
or 20th of the month Thargelion, before the
Panathenaea Minora. The temple of Bendis
was called Bendideion.</p>


<p id="Beneficium">BĔNĔFĬCĬUM, BĔNĔFĬCĬĀRĬUS. The
term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">beneficium</i> is of frequent occurrence in
the Roman law, in the sense of some special
privilege or favour granted to a person in
respect of age, sex, or condition. But the
word was also used in other senses. In the
time of Cicero it was usual for a general, or
a governor of a province, to report to the
treasury the names of those under his command
who had done good service to the state:
those who were included in such report were
said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in beneficiis ad aerarium deferri</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In beneficiis</i>
in these passages may mean that the
persons so reported were considered as persons
who had deserved well of the state; and
so the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">beneficium</i> may have reference to
the services of the individuals; but as the
object for which their services were reported
was the benefit of the individuals, it seems
that the term had reference also to the reward,
immediate or remote, obtained for their services.
The honours and offices of the Roman
state, in the republican period, were called
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">beneficia</i> of the Populus Romanus. Beneficium
also signified any promotion conferred
on or grant made to soldiers, who were
thence called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">beneficiarii</i>.</p>


<p id="Bestiarii">BESTIĀRĬI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θηριομάχοι</span>), persons who
fought with wild beasts in the games of the
circus. They were either persons who fought
for the sake of pay (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctoramentum</i>), and
who were allowed arms, or they were criminals,
who were usually permitted to have no
means of defence against the wild beasts.</p>


<p id="Bibliopola">BIBLĬŎPŌLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βιβλιοπώλης</span>), also called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">librarius</i>, a bookseller. The shop was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apotheca</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taberna libraria</i>, or merely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libraria</i>.
The Romans had their Paternoster-row;
for the bibliopolae or librarii lived
mostly in one street, called Argiletum. Another
favourite quarter of the booksellers was
the Vicus Sandalarius. There seems also to
have been a sort of bookstalls by the temples
of Vertumnus and Janus.</p>


<p id="Bibliotheca">BIBLĬŎTHĒCA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βιβλιοθήκη</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποθήκη
βιβλίων</span>), primarily, the place where a collection
of books was kept; secondarily, the collection
itself. Public collections of books
appear to have been very ancient. That of
Peisistratus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 550) was intended for public
use; it was subsequently removed to Persia
by Xerxes. About the same time Polycrates,
tyrant of Samos, is said to have founded a
library. In the best days of Athens, even
private persons had large collections of books;
but the most important and splendid public
library of antiquity was that founded by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Ptolemies at Alexandria, begun under Ptolemy
Soter, but increased and re-arranged in an
orderly and systematic manner by Ptolemy
Philadelphus, who also appointed a fixed
librarian, and otherwise provided for the usefulness
of the institution. A great part of
this splendid library was consumed by fire in
the siege of Alexandria by Julius Caesar; but
it was soon restored, and continued in a
flourishing condition till it was destroyed by
the Arabs, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 640. The Ptolemies were not
long without a rival in zeal. Eumenes, king of
Pergamus, became a patron of literature and
the sciences, and established a library, which,
in spite of the prohibition against exporting
papyrus issued by Ptolemy, who was jealous
of his success, became very extensive, and
perhaps next in importance to the library of
Alexandria. The first public library in Rome
was that founded by Asinius Pollio, and was
in the atrium Libertatis on Mount Aventine.
The library of Pollio was followed by that of
Augustus in the temple of Apollo on Mount Palatine
and by another, bibliothecae Octavianae,
in the theatre of Marcellus. There were also
libraries on the Capitol, in the temple of
Peace, in the palace of Tiberius, besides the
Ulpian library, which was the most famous,
founded by Trajan. Libraries were also
usually attached to the Thermae. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Balneum">Balneum</a>.</span>]
Private collections of books were made at
Rome soon after the second Punic war.
The zeal of Cicero, Atticus, and others,
in increasing their libraries is well known.
It became, in fact, the fashion to have a
room elegantly furnished as a library, and
reserved for that purpose. The charge of the
libraries in Rome was given to persons called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">librarii</i>.</p>


<p id="Bicos">BĪCOS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βῖκος</span>), the name of an earthen
vessel in common use among the Greeks, for

<p id="Bidental">BĬDENTAL, the name given to a place
where any one had been struck by lightning,
or where any one had been killed by lightning
and buried. Such a place was considered
sacred. Priests, who were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bidentales</i>,
collected the earth which had been torn up
by lightning, and every thing that had been
scorched, and burnt it in the ground with a
sorrowful murmur. The officiating priest
was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">condere fulgur</i>; he further consecrated
the spot by sacrificing a two-year-old
sheep (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bidens</i>), whence the name of the place
and of the priest, and he also erected an altar,
and surrounded it with a wall or fence. To
move the bounds of a bidental, or in any way
to violate its sacred precincts, was considered
as sacrilege.</p>


<p id="Bidiaei">BIDIAEI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βιδιαῖοι</span>), magistrates in Sparta,

<p id="Boedromia">BŎĒDRŎMĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βοηδρόμια</span>), a festival celebrated
at Athens on the seventh day of the
month Boëdromion, in honour of Apollo Boëdromius.
The name Boëdromius, by which
Apollo was called in Boeotia and many other
parts of Greece, seems to indicate that by
this festival he was honoured as a martial
god, who, either by his actual presence or
by his oracles, afforded assistance in the dangers
of war.</p>


<p id="Boeotarches">BOEŌTARCHĒS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βοιωτάρχης</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βοιωτάρχος</span>),
the name of the chief magistrates of the
Boeotian confederacy, chosen by the different
states. Their duties were chiefly of a military
character. Each state of the confederacy
elected one boeotarch, the Thebans two. The
total number from the whole confederacy
varied with the number of the independent
states, but at the time of the Peloponnesian
war they appear to have been ten or twelve.
The boeotarchs, when engaged in military service,
formed a council of war, the decisions
of which were determined by a majority of
votes, the president being one of the two
Theban boeotarchs, who commanded alternately.
Their period of service was a year,
beginning about the winter solstice; and
whoever continued in office longer than his
time was punishable with death, both at
Thebes and in other cities.</p>


<p id="Bona">BŎNA, property. The phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in bonis</i> is
frequently used as opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominium</i> or
<em>Quiritarian ownership</em> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex jure Quiritium</i>).
The ownership of certain kinds of things among
the Romans could only be transferred from one
person to another with certain formalities, or
acquired by usucapion (that is, the uninterrupted
possession of a thing for a certain
time). But if it was clearly the intention of
the owner to transfer the ownership, and the
necessary forms only were wanting, the purchaser
had the thing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in bonis</i>, and he had the
enjoyment of it, though the original owner
was still <em>legally</em> the owner, and was said to
have the thing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex jure Quiritium</i>, notwithstanding
he had parted with the thing. The
person who possessed a thing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in bonis</i> was
protected in the enjoyment of it by the praetor,

<p id="Bona_c">BŎNA CĂDŪCA. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caducum</i> literally signifies
that which falls: thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">glans caduca</i>
is the mast which falls from a tree. The
strict legal sense of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caducum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona caduca</i>
is as follows:&mdash;If a thing is left by testament
to a person, so that he can take it by the jus
civile, but from some cause has not taken it,
that thing is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caducum</i>, as if it had <em>fallen</em>
from him. Or if a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heres ex parte</i>, or a legatee,
died before the opening of the will, the
thing was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caducum</i>. That which was caducum
came, in the first place, to those among
the heredes who had children; and if the
heredes had no children, it came among those
of the legatees who had children. In case
there was no prior claimant the caducum
belonged to the aerarium; and subsequently
to the fiscus. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aerarium">Aerarium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Bona_f">BŎNA FĬDES implies, generally speaking,
the absence of all fraud and unfair dealing or
acting. In various actions arising out of
mutual dealings, such as buying and selling,
lending and hiring, partnership and others,
bona fides is equivalent to aequum and justum;
and such actions were sometimes called
bonae fidei actiones. The formula of the
praetor, which was the authority of the judex,
empowered him in such cases to inquire and
determine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex bona fide</i>, that is, according to
the real merits of the case: sometimes aequius
melius was used instead of ex bona fide.</p>


<p id="Bonorum">BŎNŌRUM CESSĬO. There were two
kinds of bonorum cessio, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jure</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extra jus</i>.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jure cessio</i> was a mode of transferring
ownership by means of a fictitious suit. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonorum cessio extra jus</i> was introduced by
a Julian law, passed either in the time of
Julius Caesar or Augustus, which allowed an
insolvent debtor to give up his property to his
creditors. The debtor thus avoided the infamia
consequent on the bonorum emtio,
which was involuntary, and he was free from
all personal execution. He was also allowed
to retain a small portion of his property for
his support. The property thus given up
was sold, and the proceeds distributed among
the creditors.</p>


<p id="Bonorum_c">BŎNŌRUM COLLĀTĬO. By the strict
rules of the civil law an emancipated son had
no right to the inheritance of his father, whether
he died testate or intestate. But, in
course of time, the praetor granted to emancipated
children the privilege of equal succession
with those who remained in the power
of the father at the time of his death; but
only on condition that they should bring into
one common stock with their father’s property,
and for the purpose of an equal division
among all the father’s children, whatever
property they had at the time of the father’s
death, and which would have been acquired
for the father in case they had still remained
in his power. This was called bonorum collatio.</p>


<p id="Bonorum_e">BŎNŌRUM EMTĬO ET EMTOR. The
expression bonorum emtio applies to a sale of
the property either of a living or of a dead
person. It was in effect, as to a living debtor,
an execution. In the case of a dead person,
his property was sold when it was ascertained
that there was neither heres nor bonorum
possessor, nor any other person entitled to
succeed to it. In the case of the property of
a living person being sold, the praetor, on
the application of the creditors, ordered it to
be possessed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">possideri</i>) by the creditors for
thirty successive days, and notice to be given
of the sale. This explains the expression in
Livy (ii. 24): “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne quis militis, donec in
castris esset, bona <em>possideret</em> aut venderet.</span>”</p>


<p id="Bonorum_p">BŎNŌRUM POSSESSĬO was the right of
suing for or retaining a patrimony or thing
which belonged to another at the time of his
death. The bonorum possessio was given by
the edict both <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra tabulas</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum tabulas</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intestati</i>. 1. An emancipated son
had no legal claim on the inheritance of his
father; but if he was omitted in his father’s
will, or not expressly exheredated, the praetor’s
edict gave him the bonorum possessio
contra tabulas, on condition that he would
bring into hotchpot (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonorum collatio</i>) with
his brethren who continued in the parent’s
power, whatever property he had at the time
of the parent’s death. 2. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonorum possessio
secundum tabulas</i> was that possession
which the praetor gave, conformably to the
words of the will, to those named in it as
heredes, when there was no person intitled to
make a claim against the will, or none who
chose to make such a claim. 3. In the case
of intestacy (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intestati</i>) there were seven degrees
of persons who might claim the bonorum
possessio, each in his order, upon there being
no claim of a prior degree. The first three
degrees were children, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legitimi heredes</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proximi cognati</i>. Emancipated children could
claim as well as those who were not emancipated,
and adoptive as well as children
of the blood; but not children who had been
adopted into another family. If a freedman
died intestate, leaving only a wife (in manu)
or an adoptive son, the patron was entitled
to the bonorum possessio of one half of his
property.</p>


<p id="Boonae">BŎŌNAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βοῶναι</span>), persons in Athens who
purchased oxen for the public sacrifices and
feasts. They are spoken of by Demosthenes
in conjunction with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροποιοί</span> and those
who presided over the mysteries.</p>

<p id="Boreasmus">BORĔASMUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βορεασμός</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βορεασμοί</span>), a
festival celebrated by the Athenians in honour
of Boreas, which, as Herodotus seems to
think, was instituted during the Persian war,
when the Athenians, being commanded by an
oracle to invoke their <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γαμβρὸς ἐπίκουρος</span>, prayed
to Boreas. But considering that Boreas was
intimately connected with the early history of
Attica, we have reason to suppose that even
previous to the Persian wars certain honours
were paid to him, which were perhaps only
revived and increased after the event recorded
by Herodotus. The festival, however,
does not seem ever to have had any great
celebrity.</p>


<p id="Boule">BOULĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλή&mdash;ἡ τῶν πεντακοσίων</span>). In
the heroic ages, represented to us by Homer,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">boulé</i> is simply an aristocratical council
of the elders amongst the nobles, sitting
under their king as president, which decided
on public business and judicial matters, frequently
in connection with, but apparently
not subject to an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agora</i>, or meeting of the
freemen of the state. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Agora">Agora</a>.</span>] This form
of government, though it existed for some
time in the Ionian, Aeolian, and Achaean
states, was at last wholly abolished in these
states. Among the Dorians, however, especially
among the Spartans, this was not the
case, for they retained the kingly power of
the Heracleidae, in conjunction with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gerousia</i> or assembly of elders, of which the
kings were members. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Gerousia">Gerousia</a>.</span>] At Athens
on the contrary, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">boulé</i> was a representative,
and in most respects a popular body
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημοτικόν</span>). The first institution of the
Athenian <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">boulé</i> is generally attributed to
Solon; but there are strong reasons for supposing
that, as in the case of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Areiopagus</i>,
he merely modified the constitution of a body
which he found already existing. But be
this as it may, it is admitted that Solon
made the number of his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">boulé</i> 400, 100 from
each of the four tribes. When the number of
the tribes was raised to ten by Cleisthenes
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 510), the council also was increased to
500, fifty being taken from each of the ten
tribes. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bouleutae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλευταί</span>) or councillors
were appointed by lot, and hence they
are called councillors made by the bean (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ
ἀπὸ τοῦ κυάμου βουλευταί</span>), from the use of
beans in drawing lots. They were required
to submit to a scrutiny or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docimasia</i>, in which
they gave evidence of being genuine citizens,
of never having lost their civic rights by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimia</i>,
and also of being above 30 years of age.
They remained in office for a year, receiving
a drachma (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μισθὸς βουλευτικός</span>) for each day
on which they sat: and independent of the
general account (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐθύναι</span>), which the whole
body had to give at the end of the year, any
single member was liable to expulsion for
misconduct by his colleagues. The senate of
500 was divided into ten sections of fifty
each, the members of which were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytanes</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρυτάνεις</span>), and were all of the same
tribe; they acted as presidents both of the
council and the assemblies during thirty-five
or thirty-six days, as the case might be, so
as to complete the lunar year of 354 days
(12×29½). Each tribe exercised these functions
in turn; the period of office was called
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytany</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρυτανεία</span>), and the tribe that presided
the <em>presiding tribe</em>; the order in which
the tribes presided was determined by lot,
and the four supernumerary days were given
to the tribes which came last in order. Moreover,
to obviate the difficulty of having too
many in office at once, every fifty was subdivided
into five bodies of ten each; its prytany
also being portioned out into five periods
of seven days each; so that only ten senators
presided for a week over the rest, and were
thence called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proedri</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόεδροι</span>). Again, out
of these proedri an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epistates</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστάτης</span>) was
chosen for one day to preside as a chairman
in the senate, and the assembly of the people;
during his day of office he kept the public
records and seal. The prytanes had the right
of convening the council and the assembly
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</span>). The duty of the proedri and
their president was to propose subjects for
discussion, and to take the votes both of the
councillors and the people; for neglect of
their duty they were liable to a fine. Moreover,
whenever a meeting, either of the
council or of the assembly, was convened, the
chairman of the proedri selected by lot nine
others, one from each of the non-presiding
tribes; these also were called proedri, and
possessed a chairman of their own, likewise
appointed by lot from among themselves.
But the proedri who proposed the subject for
discussion to the assembly belonged to the
presiding tribe. It is observed, under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Areiopagus">Areiopagus</a></span>,
that the chief object of Solon, in forming
the senate and the areiopagus, was to
control the democratical powers of the state:
for this purpose he ordained that the senate
should discuss and vote upon all matters
before they were submitted to the assembly,
so that nothing could be laid before the
people on which the senate had not come to
a previous decision. This decision, or bill,
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probouleuma</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προβούλευμα</span>); but
then not only might this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probouleuma</i> be rejected
or modified by the assembly, but the
latter also possessed and exercised the power
of coming to a decision completely different
from the will of the senate. In addition to
the bills which it was the duty of the senate
to propose of their own accord, there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
others of a different character, viz. such as
any private individual might wish to have
submitted to the people. To accomplish this,
it was first necessary for the party to obtain,
by petition, the privilege of access to the
senate, and leave to propose his motion; and
if the measure met with their approbation, he
could then submit it to the assembly. A proposal
of this kind, which had the sanction of
the senate, was also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probouleuma</i>, and
frequently related to the conferring of some
particular honour or privilege upon an individual.
Thus the proposal of Ctesiphon for
crowning Demosthenes is so styled. In the
assembly the bill of the senate was first read,
perhaps by the crier, after the introductory
ceremonies were over; and then the proedri
put the question to the people, whether they
approved of it. The people declared their
will by a show of hands (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προχειροτονία</span>). If
it was confirmed it became a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">psephisma</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψήφισμα</span>), or decree of the people, binding
upon all classes. The form for drawing up
such decrees varied in different ages. In the
time of Demosthenes the decrees commence
with the name of the archon; then come the
day of the month, the tribe in office, and,
lastly, the name of the proposer. The motive
for passing the decree is next stated; and
then follows the decree itself, prefaced with
the formula <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεδόχθαι τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῷ δήμῳ</span>. The
senate-house was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bouleuterion</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλευτηριον</span>).
The prytanes also had a building to
hold their meetings in, where they were entertained
at the public expense during their
prytany. This was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prytaneion</i>,
and was used for a variety of purposes. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Prytaneium">Prytaneion</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Bracae">BRĀCAE, or BRACCAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναξυρίδες</span>),
trowsers, pantaloons, were common to all the
nations which encircled the Greek and Roman
population, extending from the Indian to the
Atlantic ocean, but were not worn by the
Greeks and Romans themselves. Accordingly
the monuments containing representations of
people different from the Greeks and Romans
exhibit them in trowsers, thus distinguishing
them from the latter people.</p>


<p id="Brauronia">BRAURŌNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βραυρώνια</span>), a festival celebrated
in honour of Artemis Brauronia, in the
Attic town of Brauron, where Orestes and
Iphigeneia, on their return from Tauris, were
supposed by the Athenians to have landed,
and left the statue of the Taurian goddess. It
was held every fifth year, and the chief solemnity
consisted in the Attic girls between the
ages of five and ten years going in solemn
procession to the sanctuary, where they were
consecrated to the goddess. During this act
the priests sacrificed a goat, and the girls
performed a propitiatory rite, in which they
imitated bears. This rite may have simply
risen from the circumstance that the bear was
sacred to Artemis, especially in Arcadia.
There was also a quinquennial festival called
Brauronia, which was celebrated by men and
dissolute women, at Brauron, in honour of
Dionysus.</p>

<p id="Buccina">BUCCĬNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βυκάνη</span>), a kind of horn trumpet,
anciently made out of a shell (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buccinum</i>), the
form of which is exhibited in the specimen
annexed. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buccina</i> was distinct from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornu</i>; but it is often confounded with it.
The buccina seems to have been chiefly distinguished
by the twisted form of the shell,
from which it was originally made. In later
times it was carved from horn, and perhaps
from wood or metal, so as to imitate the
shell. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buccina</i> was chiefly used to proclaim
the watches of the day and of the
night, hence called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">buccina prima</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secunda</i>,
&amp;c. It was also blown at funerals, and at
festive entertainments both before sitting
down to table and after.</p>

<p id="Bulla">BULLA, a circular plate or boss of metal,
so called from its resemblance in form to a

this description were used to adorn the sword<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
belt; but we most frequently read of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bullae</i>
as ornaments worn by children, suspended
from the neck, and especially by the sons of
the noble and wealthy. Such an one is called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heres bullatus</i> by Juvenal. The bulla was
usually made of thin plates of gold. The
use of the bulla, like that of the praetexta,
was derived from the Etruscans. It was
originally worn only by the children of the
patricians, but subsequently by all of free
birth.</p>

it was termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bustum</i>; when it was separate
from it, it was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ustrina</i>. From this

called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bustuarii</i>.</p>


<p id="Buxum">BUXUM or BUXUS, probably means the

The tablets used for writing on, and covered

made of box. In the same way the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυξίον</span>, formed from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύξος</span>, “box-wood,”
came to be applied to any tablets, whether

box-wood, and also all wind instruments,
especially the flute.</p>


<p id="Byssus">BYSSUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βύσσος</span>), linen, and not cotton.

Thebes, Anthedon, Pergamus, and Berytos.
Little is known respecting the rites observed
in these mysteries, as no one was allowed to
divulge them. The most celebrated were
those of the island of Samothrace, which, if
we may judge from those of Lemnos, were
solemnised every year, and lasted for nine
days. Persons on their admission seem to

<p id="Caduceus">CĀDŪCĔUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κηρύκειον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κηρύκιον</span>), the staff

the staff with which Hermes or Mercury is

figure of that god. From <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caduceus</i>

used for keeping wine, drawing water, &amp;c.
The name of cadus was sometimes given to
the vessel or urn in which the counters or
pebbles of the dicasts were put, when they
gave their vote on a trial, but the diminutive

<p id="Caelatura">CAELĀTŪRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τορευτική</span>), a branch of the
fine arts, under which all sorts of ornamental
work in metal, except actual statues, appear
to be included. The principal processes,
which these words were used to designate,
seem to have been of three kinds: hammering
metal plates into moulds or dies, so as to
bring out a raised pattern; engraving the
surface of metals with a sharp tool; and
working a pattern of one metal upon or into
the surface of another: in short, the various
processes which we describe by the words
<em>chasing</em>, <em>damascening</em>, &amp;c. The objects on
which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caelator</i> exercised his art were
chiefly weapons and armour&mdash;especially
shields, chariots, tripods, and other votive
offerings, quoits, candelabra, thrones, curule
chairs, mirrors, goblets, dishes, and all kinds
of gold and silver plate. The ornamental
work with which the chaser decorated such
objects consisted either of simple running
patterns, chiefly in imitation of plants and
flowers, or of animals, or of mythological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
subjects, and, for armour, of battles. The
mythological subjects were reserved for the
works of the greatest masters of the art:
they were generally executed in very high
relief (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anaglypha</i>). In the finest works, the
ornamental pattern was frequently distinct
from the vessel, to which it was either fastened
permanently, or so that it could be
removed at pleasure, the vessel being of silver,
and the ornaments of gold, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crustae aut emblemata</i>.
The art of ornamental metal-work
was in an advanced stage of progress among
the Greeks of the heroic period, as we see
from numerous passages of Homer: but its
origin, in the high artistic sense, is to be
ascribed to Phidias, and its complete development
to Polycletus. In the last age of the
Roman Republic, the prevailing wealth and
luxury, and the presence of Greek artists at
Rome, combined to bring the art more than
ever into requisition. After this period it
suddenly fell into disuse.</p>

adopted son of the great dictator, C. Julius
Caesar, and was by him handed down to his
adopted son Tiberius. It continued to be
used by Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, as
members either by adoption or female descent
of Caesar’s family; but although the
family became extinct with Nero, succeeding
emperors still retained the name as part of
their titles, and it was the practice to prefix
it to their own names, as for instance, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Imperator
Caesar Domitianus Augustus</i>. When
Hadrian adopted Aelius Varus, he allowed
the latter to take the title of Caesar; and
from this time, though the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augustus</i>
continued to be confined to the reigning emperor,
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caesar</i> was also granted to the
second person in the state and the heir presumptive
to the throne. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Augustus">Augustus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Calamistrum">CĂLĂMISTRUM, an instrument made of
iron, and hollow like a reed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calamus</i>), used
for curling the hair. For this purpose it was
heated, the person who performed the office
of heating it in wood ashes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinis</i>) being
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ciniflo</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinerarius</i>.</p>


<p id="Calamus">CĂLĂMUS, a sort of reed which the ancients
used as a pen for writing. The best
sorts were got from Aegypt and Cnidus.</p>

<p id="Calathus">CĂLĂTHUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλαθος</span>, also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάλαρος</span>),
usually signified the basket in which women
placed their work, and especially the materials
for spinning. In the following cut a
slave, belonging to the class called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasillariae</i>,
is presenting her mistress with the calathus.
Baskets of this kind were also used
for other purposes, such as for carrying fruits,
flowers, &amp;c. The name of calathi was also
given to cups for holding wine. Calathus was
properly a Greek word, though used by
the Latin writers. The Latin word corresponding
to it was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qualus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasillus</i>. From
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasillus</i> came <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasillaria</i>, the name of the
slave who spun, and who was considered the
meanest of the female slaves.</p>

<p id="Calceus">CALCĔUS, CALCĔĀMEN, CALCĔĀMENTUM
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποδήμα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέδιλον</span>), a shoe or boot, anything
adapted to cover and preserve the feet
in walking. The use of shoes was by no
means universal among the Greeks and Romans.
The Homeric heroes are represented
without shoes when armed for battle. Socrates,
Phocion, and Cato, frequently went
barefoot. The Roman slaves had no shoes.
The covering of the feet was removed before
reclining at meals. People in grief, as for
instance at funerals, frequently went barefooted.
Shoes may be divided into those in
which the mere sole of a shoe was attached
to the sole of the foot by ties or bands, or by
a covering for the toes or the instep [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Solea">Solea</a></span>;
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Crepida">Crepida</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Soccus">Soccus</a></span>]; and those which ascended
higher and higher, according as they covered
the ankles, the calf, or the whole of the leg.
To calceamenta of the latter kind, <em>i.e.</em> to
shoes and boots, as distinguished from sandals
and slippers, the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calceus</i> was applied
in its proper and restricted sense. There
were also other varieties of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calceus</i> according
to its adaptation to particular professions
or modes of life. Thus the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Caliga">Caliga</a></span> was
principally worn by soldiers; the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pero">Pero</a></span> by
labourers and rustics; and the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Cothurnus">Cothurnus</a></span> by
tragedians, hunters, and horsemen. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calcei</i> probably did not much differ from our
shoes, and are exemplified in a painting at
Herculaneum, which represents a female<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
wearing bracelets, a wreath of ivy, and a
panther’s skin, while she is in the attitude of
dancing and playing on the cymbals. The
form and colour of the calceus indicated rank
and office. Roman senators wore high shoes
like buskins, fastened in front with four black
thongs. They were also sometimes adorned
with a small crescent: we do not find on any
ancient statues the crescent, but we may regard
the bottom right hand figure in the
annexed cut as representing the shoe of a
senator. Among the calcei worn by senators,
those called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mullei</i>, from their resemblance to
the scales of the red mullet, were particularly
admired; as well as others called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alutae</i>, because
the leather was softened by the use of alum.</p>

<p id="Calculator">CALCŬLĀTOR (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λογιστής</span>), a keeper of accounts
in general, and also a teacher of arithmetic.
In Roman families of importance
there was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calculator</i> or account-keeper, who
is, however, more frequently called by the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dispensator</i>, or procurator: he was a
kind of steward.</p>


<p id="Calculi">CALCŬLI, little stones or pebbles, used for
various purposes, as, for instance, among the
Athenians for voting. Calculi were used in
playing a sort of draughts. Subsequently,
instead of pebbles, ivory, or silver, or gold,
or other men (as we call them) were used;
but they still bore the name of calculi. Calculi
were also used in reckoning; and hence
the phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calculum ponere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calculum subducere</i>.</p>

<p id="Calendarium">CĂLENDĀRĬUM or KĂLENDĀRĬUM,
generally signified an account-book, in which
were entered the names of a person’s debtors,
with the interest which they had to pay, and
it was so called because the interest had to
be paid on the calends of each month. The
word, however, was also used in the signification
of a modern calendar or almanac.
(1) <span class="smcap">Greek Calendar.</span> The Greek year was
divided into twelve lunar months, depending
on the actual changes of the moon. The first
day of the month (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νουμηνία</span>) was not the day
of the conjunction, but the day on the evening
of which the new moon appeared; consequently
full moon was the middle of the
month. The lunar month consists of twenty-nine
days and about thirteen hours; accordingly
some months were necessarily reckoned
at twenty-nine days, and rather more of them
at thirty days. The latter were called <em>full</em>
months (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πληρεῖς</span>), the former <em>hollow</em> months
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοῖλοι</span>). As the twelve lunar months fell
short of the solar year, they were obliged
every other year to interpolate an intercalary
month (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μὴν ἐμβολιμαῖος</span>) of thirty or twenty-nine
days. The ordinary year consisted of
354 days, and the interpolated year, therefore,
of 384 or 383. This interpolated year (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριέτηρις</span>)
was seven days and a half too long,
and to correct the error, the intercalary month
was from time to time omitted. The Attic
year began with the summer solstice: the
following is the sequence of the Attic months
and the number of days in each:&mdash;Hecatombaeon
(30), Metageitnion (29), Boedromion
(30), Pyanepsion (29), Maemacterion
(30), Poseideon (29), Gamelion (30), Anthesterion
(29), Elaphebolion (30), Munychion
(29), Thargelion (30), Scirophorion (29).
The intercalary month was a second Poseideon
inserted in the middle of the year. Every
Athenian month was divided into three decads.
The days of the first decad were designated
as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱσταμένου</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχομένου μηνος</span>, and
were counted on regularly from one to ten;
thus, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δευτέρα ἀρχομένου</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱσταμένου</span> is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
“the second day of the month.” The days of the
second decad were designated as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ δέκα</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεσοῦντος</span>, and were counted on regularly
from the 11th to the 20th day, which was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴκας</span>. There were two ways of counting
the days of the last decad; they were
either reckoned onwards from the 20th (thus,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρώτη ἐπὶ εἰκάδι</span> was the 21st), or backwards
from the last day, with the addition <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φθίνοντος</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παυομένου</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λήγοντος</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπίοντος</span>; thus, the
twenty-first day of a hollow month was <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνάτη
φθίνοντος</span>; of a full month, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκάτη φθίνοντος</span>.
The last day of the month was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕνη καὶ
νέα</span>, “the old and new,” because as the lunar
month really consisted of more than twenty-nine
and less than thirty days, the last day
might be considered as belonging equally to
the old and new month. Separate years were
designated at Athens by the name of the
chief archon, hence called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">archon eponymus</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων ἐπώνυμος</span>), or “the name giving archon;”
at Sparta, by the first of the ephors;
at Argos, by the priestess of <span class="smcap">Juno</span>, &amp;c.&mdash;(2)
<span id="Calendarium_r" class="smcap">Roman Calendar.</span> The old Roman, frequently
called the Romulian year, consisted
of only ten months, which were called Martius,
Aprilis, Maius, Junius, Quinctilis, Sextilis,
September, October, November, December.
That March was the first month in the
year is implied in the last six names. Of
these months, four, namely, Martius, Maius,
Quinctilis, and October, consisted of thirty-one
days, the other six of thirty. The four
former were distinguished in the latest form
of the Roman calendar by having their nones
two days later than any of the other months.
The symmetry of this arrangement will appear
by placing the numbers in succession:&mdash;31,
30; 31, 30; 31, 30, 30; 31, 30, 30.
The Romulian year therefore consisted of 304
days, and contained thirty-eight nundinae or
weeks; every eighth day, under the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nonae</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i>, being especially devoted
to religious and other public purposes. Hence
we find that the number of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies fasti</i> afterwards
retained in the Julian calendar tally
exactly with these thirty-eight nundines; besides
which, it may be observed that a year
of 304 days bears to a solar year of 365 days
nearly the ratio of five to six, six of the Romulian
years containing 1824, five of the
solar years 1825 days; and hence we may
explain the origin of the well-known quinquennial
period called the lustrum, which
ancient writers expressly call an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annus magnus</i>;
that is, in the modern language of chronology,
a cycle. It was consequently the
period at which the Romulian and solar years
coincided. The next division of the Roman
year was said to have been made by Numa
Pompilius, who instituted a lunar year of 12
months and 355 days. Livy says that Numa
so regulated his lunar year of twelve months
by the insertion of intercalary months, that
at the end of every <em>nineteenth</em> year (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vicesimo
anno</i>) it again coincided with the same point
in the sun’s course from which it started. It
is well known that 19 years constitute a most
convenient cycle for the junction of a lunar
and solar year. It seems certain that the
Romans continued to use a lunar year for
some time after the establishment of the republic;
and it was probably at the time of
the decemviral legislation that the lunar year
was abandoned. By the change which was
then made the year consisted of 12 months,
the length of each of which was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The year thus consisted of 355 days, and this
was made to correspond with the solar year
by the insertion of an intercalary month
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensis intercalaris</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intercalarius</i>), called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mercedonius</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mercidonius</i>. This month of
22 or 23 days seems to have been inserted in
alternate years. As the festivals of the Romans
were for the most part dependent upon
the calendar, the regulation of the latter was
entrusted to the college of pontifices, who in
early times were chosen exclusively from the
body of patricians. It was therefore in the
power of the college to add to their other
means of oppressing the plebeians, by keeping
to themselves the knowledge of the days
on which justice could be administered, and
assemblies of the people could be held. In
the year 304 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, one Cn. Flavius, a secretary
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriba</i>) of Appius Claudius, is said fraudulently
to have made the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti</i> public. The
other privilege of regulating the year by the
insertion of the intercalary month gave the
pontiffs great political power, which they
were not backward to employ. Every thing
connected with the matter of intercalation
was left to their unrestrained pleasure; and
the majority of them, on personal grounds,
added to or took from the year by capricious
intercalations, so as to lengthen or shorten
the period during which a magistrate remained
in office, and seriously to benefit or
injure the farmer of the public revenue. The
calendar was thus involved in complete confusion,
and accordingly we find that in the
time of Cicero the year was three months in
advance of the real solar year. At length, in
the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 46, Caesar, now master of the
Roman world, employed his authority, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
pontifex maximus, in the correction of this
serious evil. The account of the way in
which he effected this is given by Censorinus:&mdash;“The
confusion was at last carried so
far that C. Caesar, the pontifex maximus, in
his third consulate, with Lepidus for his colleague,
inserted between November and December
two intercalary months of 67 days,
the month of February having already received
an intercalation of 23 days, and thus
made the whole year to consist of 445 days.
At the same time he provided against a repetition
of similar errors, by casting aside the
intercalary month, and adapting the year to
the sun’s course. Accordingly, to the 355
days of the previously existing year he added
ten days, which he so distributed between
the seven months having 29 days that January,
Sextilis, and December received two
each, the others but one; and these additional
days he placed at the end of the several
months, no doubt with the wish not to
remove the various festivals from those positions
in the several months which they had
so long occupied. Hence in the present
calendar, although there are seven months of
31 days, yet the four months, which from the
first possessed that number, are still distinguishable
by having their nones on the
seventh, the rest having them on the fifth of
the month. Lastly, in consideration of the
quarter of a day, which he regarded as
completing the true year, he established the
rule that, at the end of every four years, a
single day should be intercalated, where the
month had been hitherto inserted, that is,
immediately after the terminalia; which day
is now called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bissextum</i>.” The mode of
denoting the days of the month will cause no
difficulty, if it be recollected that the kalends
always denote the first of the month; that
the nones occur on the seventh of the four
months of March, May, Quinctilis or July,
and October, and on the fifth of the other
months; that the ides always fall eight days
later than the nones; and lastly, that the
intermediate days are in all cases reckoned
backwards upon the Roman principle of
counting both extremes. For the month of
January the notation will be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">In which the words <em>prior</em> and <em>posterior</em> are
used in reference to the retrograde direction
of the reckoning. From the fact that the
intercalated year has two days called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante
diem sextum</i>, the name bissextile has been
applied to it. The term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annus bissextilis</i>,
however, does not occur in any classical
writer, but in place of it the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annus
bissextus</i>.&mdash;The names of two of the months
were changed in honour of Julius Caesar and
Augustus. Julius was substituted for Quinctilis,
the month in which Caesar was born,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
in the second Julian year, that is, the year
of the dictator’s death, for the first Julian
year was the first year of the <em>corrected</em> Julian
calendar, that is, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 45. The name Augustus
in place of Sextilis was introduced by the
emperor himself in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 27. The month of
September in like manner received the name
of Germanicus from the general so called,
and the appellation appears to have existed
even in the time of Macrobius. Domitian,
too, conferred his name upon October; but
the old word was restored upon the death of
the tyrant.&mdash;The Julian calendar supposes
the mean tropical year to be 365 d. 6 h.;
but this exceeds the real amount by 11′ 12″,
the accumulation of which, year after year,
caused at last considerable inconvenience.
Accordingly, in the year 1582, Pope Gregory
XIII. again reformed the calendar. The ten
days by which the year had been unduly retarded
were struck out by a regulation that
the day after the fourth of October in that
year should be called the fifteenth; and it
was ordered that whereas hitherto an intercalary
day had been inserted every four years,
for the future three such intercalations in the
course of four hundred years should be omitted,
viz., in those years which are divisible
without remainder by 100, but not by 400.
Thus, according to the Julian calendar, the
years 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, were to
be bissextile as before. The bull which
effected this change was issued Feb. 24th,
1582. The Protestant parts of Europe resisted
what they called a papistical invention
for more than a century. In England the
Gregorian calendar was first adopted in 1752.
In Russia, and those countries which belonged
to the Greek church, the Julian year,
or <em>old style</em>, as it is called, still prevails. In
the ancient calendars the letters A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, H, were used for the purpose of fixing
the nundines in the week of eight days;
precisely in the same way in which the first
seven letters are still employed in ecclesiastical
calendars, to mark the days of the Christian
week.</p>


<p id="Caliga">CĂLĬGA, a strong and heavy sandal worn
by the Roman soldiers, but not by the superior
officers. Hence the common soldiers,
including centurions, were distinguished by
the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caligati</i>. The emperor Caligula
received that cognomen when a boy, in consequence
of wearing the caliga, and being
inured to the life of a common soldier. The
cuts on pp. <a href="#ill001b">1</a>, <a href="#ill041">41</a>, show the difference between
the caliga of the common soldier and the calceus
worn by men of higher rank.</p>


<p id="Calix">CĂLIX (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύλιξ</span>). (1) a drinking-cup used at
symposia and on similar occasions.&mdash;(2) A
vessel used in cooking.&mdash;(3) A tube in the
aquaeducts attached to the extremity of each
pipe, where it entered the castellum.</p>

<p id="Callis">CALLIS, a beaten path or track made by
the feet of cattle. The sheep-walks in the
mountainous parts of Campania and Apulia
were the property of the Roman state; and
as they were of considerable value, one of the
quaestors usually had these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calles</i> assigned to
him as his province, whence we read of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Callium provincia</i>. His principal duties were
to receive the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptura</i>, or tax paid for the
pasturage of the cattle, and to protect life and
property in these wild and mountainous districts.
When the senate wished to put a
slight upon the consuls on one occasion they
endeavoured to assign to them as their provinces,
the care of the woods (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silvae</i>) and
sheep-walks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calles</i>).</p>


<p id="Callisteia">CALLISTEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλλιστεῖα</span>), a festival, or
perhaps merely a part of one, held by the
women of Lesbos; at which they assembled in
the sanctuary of Hera, and the fairest received
the prize of beauty. Similar contests of beauty
are said to have been held in other places.</p>


<p id="Calones">CĀLŌNES, the slaves or servants of the
Roman soldiers, so called from carrying
wood (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κᾶλα</span>) for their use. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calo</i>,
however, was also applied to farm-servants.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calones</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lixae</i> are frequently spoken
of together, but they were not the same: the
latter were freemen, who merely followed the
camp for the purposes of gain and merchandise,
and were so far from being indispensable
to an army, that they were sometimes forbidden
to attend it.</p>


<p id="Calumnia">CĂLUMNĬA. When an accuser failed in
his proof, and the accused party was acquitted,
there might be an inquiry into the
conduct and motives of the accuser. If the
person who made this judicial inquiry found
that the accuser had merely acted from error<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
of judgment, he acquitted him in the form
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non probasti</i>; if he convicted him of evil intention,
he declared his sentence in the words
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calumniatus es</i>, which sentence was followed
by the legal punishment. The punishment
for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calumnia</i> was fixed by the lex Remmia, or
as it is sometimes, perhaps incorrectly, named,
the lex Memmia. But it is not known when
this lex was passed, nor what were its penalties.
It appears from Cicero, that the false
accuser might be branded on the forehead
with the letter K, the initial of Kalumnia.
The punishment for calumnia was also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsilium,
relegatio in insulam</i>, or loss of rank
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordinis amissio</i>); but probably only in criminal
cases, or in matters relating to status.</p>


<p id="Camara">CĂMĂRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καμάρα</span>), or CĂMĔRA. (1) A
particular kind of arched ceiling, formed by
semicircular bands or beams of wood, arranged
at small lateral distances, over which
a coating of lath and plaster was spread, and
the whole covered in by a roof, resembling in
construction the hooped awnings in use
amongst us.&mdash;(2) A small boat used in early
times by the people who inhabited the shores
of the Palus Maeotis, capable of containing
from twenty-five to thirty men. These boats
were made to work fore and aft, like the fast-sailing
proas of the Indian seas, and continued
in use until the age of Tacitus.</p>


<p id="Camilli">CĂMILLI, CĂMILLAE, boys and girls
employed in the religious rites and ceremonies
of the Romans. They were required to
be perfect in form, and sound in health, free
born, and with both their parents alive; or,
in other words, according to the expression of
the Romans, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pueri seu puellae ingenui, felicissimi,
patrimi matrimique</i>.</p>


<p id="Caminus">CĂMĪNUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Domus">Domus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Campestre">CAMPESTRE (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subligar</i>), a kind of
girdle or apron, which the Roman youths
wore around their loins, when they exercised
naked in the Campus Martius. The campestre
was sometimes worn in warm weather, in
place of the tunic under the toga.</p>


<p id="Campus">CAMPUS MARTĬUS. [See <span class="smcap">Classical Dictionary</span>.]</p>


<p id="Canabus">CĂNĂBUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάναβος</span>), a figure of wood in
the form of a skeleton, round which the clay
or plaster was laid in forming models. Figures
of a similar kind, formed to display the
muscles and veins, were studied by painters in
order to acquire some knowledge of anatomy.</p>


<p id="Canathron">CĀNATHRON (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάναθρον</span>), a carriage, the
upper part of which was made of basket-work,
or more properly the basket itself, which was
fixed in the carriage.</p>


<p id="Cancellarius">CANCELLĀRĬUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cancelli">Cancelli</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Cancelli">CANCELLI, lattice-work, placed before a
window, a door-way, the tribunal of a judge,
or any other place. Hence was derived the
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cancellarius</i>, which originally signified
a porter, who stood at the latticed or grated
door of the emperor’s palace. The cancellarius
also signified a legal scribe or secretary,
who sat within the cancelli or lattice-work.
The chief scribe or secretary was
called Cancellarius <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατ’ ἐξοχήν</span>, and was eventually
invested with judicial power at Constantinople.
From this word has come the
modern Chancellor.</p>


<p id="Candela">CANDĒLA, a candle, made either of wax
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerea</i>), or tallow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sebacea</i>), was used universally
by the Romans before the invention
of oil lamps (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucernae</i>). In later times candelae
were only used by the poorer classes;
the houses of the more wealthy were always
lighted by lucernae.</p>


<p id="Candelabrum">CANDĒLABRUM, originally a candlestick,
but afterwards the name of a stand for supporting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
lamps (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λυχνοῦχοι</span>), in which signification
it most commonly occurs. The candelabra
of this kind were usually made to stand
upon the ground, and were of a considerable
height. The most common kind were made
of wood; but those which have been found
in Herculaneum and Pompeii are mostly of
bronze. Sometimes they were made of the
more precious metals, and even of jewels.
The candelabra did not always stand upon
the ground, but were also placed upon the
table. Such candelabra usually consisted of
pillars, from the capitals of which several
lamps hung down, or of trees, from whose
branches lamps also were suspended.</p>

Medes and Persians over their trowsers and
other garments. It had wide sleeves, and
was made of woollen cloth, which was either
purple or of some other splendid colour. In
the Persepolitan sculptures, from which the
annexed figures are taken, nearly all the
principal personages wear it.</p>

<p id="Canephoros">CĂNĒPHŎROS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κανηφόρος</span>), a virgin who

at sacrifices, in which the chaplet of
flowers, the knife to slay the victim, and
sometimes the frankincense were deposited.
The name, however, was more particularly
applied to two virgins of the first Athenian
families who were appointed to officiate as
canephori at the Panathaenaea. The preceding
cut represents the two canephori
approaching a candelabrum. Each of them
elevates one arm to support the basket while
she slightly raises her tunic with the other.</p>

<p id="Canticum">CANTĬCUM, an interlude between the acts
of a Roman comedy, and sometimes, perhaps,
of a tragedy. It consisted of flute music,
accompanied by a kind of recitative performed
by a single actor, or if there were two, the
second was not allowed to speak with the
first. In the canticum, as violent gesticulation
was required, it appears to have been
the custom, from the time of Livius Andronicus,
for the actor to confine himself to
the gesticulation, while another person sang
the recitative.</p>

fibrous materials. The Greek word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φορβειά</span>
was also applied to a contrivance used by
pipers and trumpeters to compress their
mouths and cheeks, and thus to aid them in
blowing. It is often seen in works of ancient

Marsyas. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tibia">Tibia</a>.</span>]</p>

<p id="Capsa">CAPSA, or SCRĪNĬUM, a box for holding
books among the Romans. These boxes
were of a cylindrical form. There does not
appear to have been any difference between
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capsa</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scrinium</i>, except that the latter
word was usually applied to those boxes which
held a considerable number of rolls. The
slaves who had the charge of these book-chests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capsarii</i>, and also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">custodes

capsa behind their young masters the books,
&amp;c. of the sons of respectable Romans, when
they went to school, were called by the same
name.</p>

<p id="Caput">CĂPUT, the head. The term “head” is
often used by the Roman writers as equivalent
to “person,” or “human being.” By
an easy transition it was used to signify
“life:” thus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capite damnari</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plecti</i>, &amp;c., are
equivalent to capital punishment. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caput</i> is
also used to express a man’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status</i>, or civil
condition; and the persons who were registered
in the tables of the censor are spoken
of as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capita</i>, sometimes with the addition of
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civium</i>, and sometimes not. Thus
to be registered in the census was the same
thing as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput habere</i>: and a slave and a
filius familias, in this sense of the word, were
said to have no <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput</i>. The sixth class of
Servius Tullius comprised the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proletarii</i> and
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capite censi</i>, of whom the latter, having
little or no property, were barely rated as so
many <em>head</em> of citizens.&mdash;He who lost or
changed his status was said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capite
minutus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deminutus</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capitis minor</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capitis
minutio</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deminutio</i> was a change of a
person’s status or civil condition, and consisted
of three kinds.&mdash;A Roman citizen possessed
freedom (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libertas</i>), citizenship (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civitas</i>),
and family (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familias</i>): the loss of all three
constituted the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maxima capitis deminutio</i>.
This capitis deminutio was sustained by those
who refused to be registered at the census, or
neglected the registration, and were thence
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incensi</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incensus</i> was liable to
be sold, and so to lose his liberty. Those
who refused to perform military service might
also be sold.&mdash;The loss of citizenship and
family only, as when a man was interdicted
from fire and water, was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">media capitis
deminutio</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Exsilium">Exsilium</a>.</span>]&mdash;The change of family
by adoption, and by the in manum conventio,
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minima capitis deminutio</i>.&mdash;A
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicium capitale</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">poena capitalis</i>, was
one which affected a citizen’s caput.</p>


<p id="Caput_f">CĂPUT. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fenus">Fenus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Caput_e">CĂPUT EXTŌRUM. The Roman soothsayers
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">haruspices</i>) pretended to a knowledge
of coming events from the inspection of the
entrails of victims slain for that purpose.
The part to which they especially directed
their attention was the liver, the convex
upper portion of which seems to have been
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput extorum</i>. Any disease or
deficiency in this organ was considered an
unfavourable omen; whereas, if healthy and
perfect, it was believed to indicate good fortune.
If no caput was found, it was a bad sign
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nihil tristius accidere potuit</i>); if well defined
or double, it was a lucky omen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>


<p id="Caracalla">CĂRĂCALLA, an outer garment used in
Gaul, and not unlike the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lacerna</i>. It
was first introduced at Rome by the emperor
Aurelius Antoninus Bassianus, who compelled
all the people that came to court to wear it,
whence he obtained the surname of Caracalla.
This garment, as worn in Gaul, does not
appear to have reached lower than the knee,
but Caracalla lengthened it so as to reach the
ankle.</p>


<p id="Carcer">CARCER (<em>kerker</em>, German; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γοργύρα</span>,
Greek), a prison, is connected with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕρκος</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἵργω</span>, the guttural being interchanged
with the aspirate. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span> Imprisonment
was seldom used amongst the Greeks as a
legal punishment for offences; they preferred
banishment to the expense of keeping prisoners
in confinement. The prisons in different
countries were called by different names;
thus there was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceadas</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κεάδας</span>), at Sparta;
and, among the Ionians, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gorgyra</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γοργύρα</span>),
as at Samos. The prison at Athens
was in former times called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Desmoterion</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεσμωτήριον</span>),
and afterwards, by a sort of euphemism,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἴκημα</span>. It was chiefly used as a guard-house
or place of execution, and was under the
charge of the public officers called the Eleven.&mdash;(2)
<span class="smcap">Roman.</span> A prison was first built at Rome
by Ancus Martius, overhanging the forum.
This was enlarged by Servius Tullius, who
added to it a souterrain, or dungeon, called
from him the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tullianum</i>. Sallust describes
this as being twelve feet under ground,
walled on each side, and arched over with
stone work. For a long time this was the
only prison at Rome, being, in fact, the
“Tower,” or state prison of the city, which
was sometimes doubly guarded in times of
alarm, and was the chief object of attack in
many conspiracies. There were, however,
other prisons besides this, though, as we
might expect, the words of Roman historians
generally refer to this alone. In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tullianum</i>
prisoners were generally executed,
and this part of the prison was also called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">robur</i>.</p>

<p id="Carchesium">CARCHĒSĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καρχήσιον</span>). (1) A beaker or
drinking-cup, which was used by the Greeks
in very early times. It was slightly contracted
in the middle, and its two handles
extended from the top to the bottom. It was
much employed in libations of wine, milk,
and honey.&mdash;(2) The upper part of the mast
of a ship. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Navis">Navis</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Carmentalia">CARMENTĀLĬA, a festival celebrated in
honour of Carmenta or Carmentis, who is
fabled to have been the mother of Evander,
who came from Pallantium in Arcadia, and
settled in Latium: he was said to have
brought with him a knowledge of the arts,
and the Latin alphabetical characters as distinguished
from the Etruscan. This festival
was celebrated annually on the 11th of January.
A temple was erected to the same
goddess, at the foot of the Capitoline hill,
near the Porta Carmentalis, afterwards called
Scelerata. The name Carmenta is said to
have been given to her from her prophetic
character, carmens or carmentis being synonymous
with vates. The word is, of course,
connected with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carmen</i>, as prophecies were
generally delivered in verse.</p>


<p id="Carneia">CARNEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καρνεῖα</span>), a great national festival,
celebrated by the Spartans in honour of
Apollo Carneios. The festival began on the
seventh day of the month of Carneios = Metageitnion
of the Athenians, and lasted for
nine days. It was of a warlike character,
similar to the Attic Boëdromia. During the
time of its celebration nine tents were pitched
near the city, in each of which nine men
lived in the manner of a military camp, obeying
in everything the commands of a herald.
The priest conducting the sacrifices at the
Carneia was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agetes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀγητής</span>), whence
the festival was sometimes designated by the
name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agetoria</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agetoreion</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀγητόρια</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀγητόρειον</span>), and from each of the Spartan
tribes five men (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Καρνεᾶται</span>) were chosen as
his ministers, whose office lasted four years,
during which period they were not allowed
to marry. When we read in Herodotus and
Thucydides that the Spartans during the
celebration of this festival were not allowed
to take the field against an enemy, we must
remember that this restriction was not peculiar
to the Carneia, but common to all the
great festivals of the Greeks: traces of it are
found even in Homer.</p>


<p id="Carnifex">CARNĬFEX, the public executioner at
Rome, who executed slaves and foreigners,
but not citizens, who were punished in a
manner different from slaves. It was also
his business to administer the torture. This
office was considered so disgraceful, that he
was not allowed to reside within the city,
but lived without the Porta Metia or Esquilina,
near the place destined for the punishment
of slaves, called Sestertium under the
emperors.</p>


<p id="Carpentum">CARPENTUM, a cart; also a two-wheeled
carriage, enclosed, and with an arched or
sloping cover overhead. The carpentum was
used to convey the Roman matrons in the
public festal processions; and this was a high
distinction, since the use of carriages in the
city was entirely forbidden during the whole
of the republican period. Hence the privilege
of riding in a carpentum in the public festivals
was sometimes granted to females of the imperial
family. This carriage contained seats for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
two, and sometimes for three persons, besides
the coachman. It was commonly drawn by
a pair of mules, but more rarely by oxen or
horses, and sometimes by four horses like a
quadriga.&mdash;Carpenta, or covered carts, were
much used by the Britons, the Gauls, and
other northern nations. These, together with
the carts of the more common form, including
baggage-waggons, appear to have been comprehended
under the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carri</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carra</i>,
which is the Celtic name with a Latin termination.
The Gauls took a great multitude of
them on their military expeditions, and when
they were encamped, arranged them in close
order, so as to form extensive lines of circumvallation.</p>


<p id="Carrago">CARRĀGO, a kind of fortification, consisting

the baggage of an army.</p>

had four wheels, and was used in travelling.
These carriages were sometimes used in Rome
by persons of distinction, like the carpenta;
in which case they appear to have been
covered with plates of bronze, silver, and even
gold, which were sometimes ornamented with
embossed work.</p>

<p id="Caryatides">CĂRỸĀTĬDES, female figures used in

to slavery by the Greeks, because
Caryae had joined the Persians at the invasion
of Greece. But this tale is probably
apocryphal. One of the porticos of the
Erechtheum at Athens is supported by Caryatides.</p>

<p id="Castra">CASTRA. Roman armies never halted for
a single night without forming a regular entrenchment,
termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castra</i>, capable of receiving
within its limits the whole body of fighting
men, their beasts of burden, and the baggage.
So completely was this recognised as a part of
the ordinary duties of each march, that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pervenire
ad locum tertiis ... quartis ... septuagesimis
castris</i> are the established phrases
for expressing the number of days occupied
in passing from one point to another. Whenever
circumstances rendered it expedient for
a force to occupy the same ground for any
length of time, then the encampment was
distinguished as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castra stativa</i>. In wild and
barbarian lands, where there were no large
towns and no tribes on whose faith reliance
could be placed, armies, whether of invasion
or occupation, were forced to remain constantly
in camps. They usually, however,
occupied different ground in summer and in
winter, whence arose the distinction between
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castra aestiva</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castra hiberna</i>, both alike
being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stativa</i>. But whether a camp was
temporary or permanent, whether tenanted
in summer or in winter, the main features of
the work were always the same for the same
epoch. In hiberna, huts of turf or stone
would be substituted for the open tents of the
aestiva (hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aedificare hiberna</i>), and in stativa
held for long periods the defences would
present a more substantial and finished aspect,
but the general outline and disposition of the
parts were invariable. Polybius has transmitted
to us a description of a Roman camp,
from which the annexed plan has been drawn
up. It is such as would be formed at the
close of an ordinary day’s march by a regular
consular army consisting of two Roman legions
with the full contingent of Socii. Each legion
is calculated at 4200 infantry and 300 cavalry;
the Socii furnished an equal number of infantry,
and twice as many cavalry, so that
the whole force would amount to 16,800 foot
and 1800 horse. Skill in the selection of a
spot for a camp (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capere locum castris</i>) was
ever considered as a high quality in a general,
and we find it recorded among the praises of
the most renowned commanders that they
were wont in person to perform this duty.
Under ordinary circumstances, however, the
task was devolved upon one of the military
tribunes, and a certain number of centurions
appointed from time to time for the purpose.
These having gone forward in advance of the
army until they reached the place near which
it was intended to halt, and having taken a
general survey of the ground, selected a spot
from whence a good view of the whole proposed
area might be obtained. This spot was
considerably within the limits of the contemplated
enclosure, and was marked by a small
white flag. The next object was to ascertain
in what direction water and fodder might be
most easily and securely provided. These
two preliminary points being decided, the
business of measuring out the ground (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metari
castra</i>) commenced, and was executed, as we
learn from various sources, with graduated
rods (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decempedae</i>) by persons denominated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metatores</i>. In practice the most important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
points were marked by white poles, some of
which bore flags of various colours, so that
the different battalions on reaching the ground
could at once discover the place assigned to
them.</p>

<p>The white flag A, which served as the
starting point of the whole construction,
marked the position of the consul’s tent, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetorium</i>, so called because <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetor</i> was the
ancient term for any one invested with supreme
command. A square area was left open, extending
a hundred feet each way from the
praetorium. The camp was divided into two
parts, the upper and the lower. The upper
part formed about a third of the whole. In
it was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetorium</i> (A) or general’s tent.
A part of the praetorium was called the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augurale</i>, as the auguries were there taken
by the general. On the right and left of the
praetorium were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quaestorium</i>;
the former a sort of market-place, the latter
appropriated to the quaestor and the camp
stores under his superintendence. On the
sides of and facing the forum and quaestorium,
were stationed select bodies of horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
(K) taken from the extraordinaries, with
mounted volunteers, who served out of respect
to the consul, and were stationed near him.
And parallel to these were posted similar
bodies of foot-soldiers (L). Before the quaestorium
and the forum were the tents of the
twelve tribunes of the two legions (B), and
before the select bodies of horse and infantry
the tents of the praefecti sociorum were probably
placed (C). Again, behind the praetorium,
the quaestorium, and the forum, ran a
street or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</i> (D), 100 feet broad, from one
side of the camp to the other. Along the
upper side of this street was ranged the main
body of the “extraordinary” horse (M): they
were separated into two equal parts by a
street fifty feet broad (E). At the back of
this body of cavalry was posted a similar
body of infantry (N), selected from the allies,
and facing the opposite way, <em>i.e.</em> towards the
ramparts of the camp. The vacant spaces
(O) on each side of these troops were reserved
for foreigners and occasional auxiliaries. The
lower part of the camp was divided from the
upper by a street, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Principalis</i>
(V P), or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principia</i>, a hundred feet broad.
Here the tribunal of the general was erected,
from which he harangued the soldiers, and
here the tribunes administered justice. Here
also the principal standards, the altars of the
gods, and the images of the emperors were
placed. The lower part of the camp was
occupied by the two legions and the troops of
the allies according to the arrangement of the
preceding cut. Between the ramparts and
the tents was left a vacant space of 200 feet
on every side, which was useful for many
purposes: thus it served for the reception of
any booty that was taken, and facilitated the
entrance and exit of the army. The camp
had four gates, one at the top and bottom,
and one at each of the sides; the top or back-gate,
which was the side most away from the
enemy, was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decumana</i>. The bottom
or the front gate was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">practoria</i>, the gates
of the sides were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porta principalis dextra</i>,
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porta principalis sinistra</i>. The whole
camp was surrounded by a trench (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fossa</i>),
generally nine feet deep and twelve broad,
and a rampart (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallum</i>) made of the earth
that was thrown up (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agger</i>), with stakes
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">valli</i>) fixed at the top of it. The labour of
this work was so divided, that the allies completed
the two sides of the camp alongside of
which they were stationed, and the two
Roman legions the rest.&mdash;In describing the
Roman camp and its internal arrangements,
we have confined ourselves to the information
given by Polybius, which, of course,
applies only to his age, and to armies constituted
like those he witnessed. When the
practice of drawing up the army according to
cohorts, ascribed to Marius or Caesar [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Exercitus">Exercitus</a></span>],
had superseded the ancient division
into maniples, and the distinction of triarii,
&amp;c., the internal arrangements of the camp
must have been changed accordingly. In each
legion the tribunes divided themselves into
three sections of two each, and each section in
turn undertook for two months the superintendence
of all matters connected with the
camp. Out of the twenty maniples of Principes
and Triarii in each legion, two were
appointed to take charge of the broad passage
or street called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principia</i>, extending right
across the camp in front of the tents of the
tribunes. Of the remaining eighteen maniples
of Principes and Hastati in each legion,
three were assigned by lot to each of the six
tribunes, and of these three maniples one in
turn rendered each day certain services to the
tribune to whom it was specially attached.
One maniple was selected each day from the
whole legionary force, to keep guard beside
the tent of the general. Three sentinels were
usually posted at the tents of the quaestor,
and of the legati: and by night sentinels
kept watch at every maniple, being chosen
out of the maniple which they guarded. The
Velites mounted guard by day and by night
along the whole extent of the vallum: to
them also in bodies of ten was committed the
charge of the gates, while strong bodies of
infantry and cavalry were thrown forward in
advance of each gate, to resist any sudden
onset, and give timely notice of the approach
of the enemy.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excubiae</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubias agere</i>;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubare</i>; are the general terms used with
reference to mounting guard whether by
night or by day. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vigiliae</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vigilias agere</i>;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vigilare</i>; are restricted to night duty: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excubiae</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vigiliae</i> frequently denote not only
the service itself, but also the individuals
who performed it. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stationes</i> is used specially
to denote the advanced posts thrown forward
in front of the gates. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Custodes</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Custodiae</i>
the parties who watched the gates themselves,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praesidia</i> the sentinels on the ramparts, but
all these words are employed in many other
significations also. The duty of going the
rounds (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vigilias circuire s. circumire</i>) was
committed to the Equites, and for this purpose
each legion supplied daily four, picked
out from each turma in rotation by the commander
of the troop. The eight persons thus
selected decided by lot in which watch they
should make their rounds, two being assigned
to each watch. They then repaired to the
tribune, and each individual received a
written order specifying the posts which he
was to visit, every post being visited in each
watch by one or other of the two to whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the watch belonged. Sometimes we find
centurions, tribunes, and even the general in
chief represented as going the rounds, but,
under ordinary circumstances, the duty was
performed as we have described. The watchword
for the night was not communicated
verbally, but by means of a small rectangular
tablet of wood (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλατεῖον ἐπιγεγραμμένον</span>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i>)
upon which it was written.&mdash;<em>Breaking
up a Camp.</em> On the first signal being given
by the trumpet, the tents were all struck and
the baggage packed, the tents of the general
and the tribunes being disposed of before the
others were touched. At the second signal
the baggage was placed upon the beasts of
burden; at the third, the whole army began
to move.</p>

many of the Eastern nations, who placed
their chief dependence upon their cavalry, we
find horses protected in this manner; but
among the Romans we do not read of any
troops of this description till the later times
of the empire, when the discipline of the legions

began to be placed on the cavalry. This

Persians from the earliest times, from whom
it was adopted by their Macedonian conquerors.

suspended by iron rings and ropes, before the
gates of a city, in such a manner that, when

which were of superior value, either on account
of the material or the workmanship,
are commonly called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">catellae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλύσια</span>), the
diminutive expressing their fineness and delicacy
as well as their minuteness. The specimens
of ancient chains which we have in
bronze lamps, in scales, and in ornaments for
the person, especially necklaces, show a great
variety of elegant and ingenious patterns.
Besides a plain circle or oval, the separate
link is often shaped like the figure 8, or is a
bar with a circle at each end, or assumes other
forms, some of which are here shown. The
links are also found so closely entwined, that
the chain resembles platted wire or thread,
like the gold chains now manufactured at
Venice. This is represented in the lowest figure
of the woodcut.</p>

<p id="Caupona">CAUPŌNA. (1) An inn, where travellers

and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατάλυσις</span>. Inns for the accommodation
of persons of all classes existed
among the Greeks and Romans, although they
were not equal either in size or convenience
to similar places in modern times. An inn
was also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taberna</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taberna diversoria</i>,
or simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diversorium</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deversorium</i>.&mdash;(2) A
shop, where wine and ready-dressed meat
were sold, thus corresponding to the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καπηλεῖον</span>. The person who kept a caupona
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caupo</i>. In Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάπηλος</span> signifies
in general a retail trader, who sold goods in
small quantities; but the word is more particularly
applied to a person who sold ready-dressed
provisions, and especially wine in
small quantities. In these <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καπηλεῖα</span> only persons
of the very lowest class were accustomed
to eat and drink. In Rome itself there were,
no doubt, inns to accommodate strangers;
but these were probably only frequented by
the lower classes, since all persons in respectable
society could easily find accommodation
in the houses of their friends. There were,
however, in all parts of the city, numerous
houses where wine and ready-dressed provisions
were sold. The houses where persons
were allowed to eat and drink were usually
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popinae</i> and not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cauponae</i>; and the
keepers of them, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popae</i>. They were principally
frequented by slaves and the lower
classes, and were consequently only furnished
with stools to sit upon instead of couches.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thermopolia</i>, where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calida</i> or warm
wine and water was sold, appear to have
been the same as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popinae</i>. Many of these
popinae were little better than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lupanaria</i>
or brothels; whence Horace calls them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">immundas
popinas</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ganeae</i>, which are
sometimes mentioned in connection with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popinae</i>, were brothels, whence they are often
classed with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lustra</i>. Under the emperors
many attempts were made to regulate the popinae,
but apparently with little success. All
persons who kept inns or houses of public
entertainment of any kind were held in low
estimation both among the Greeks and Romans.
They appear to have fully deserved
the bad reputation which they possessed, for
they were accustomed to cheat their customers
by false weights and measures, and by all the
means in their power.</p>

<p id="Cautio">CAUTĬO, CĂVĒRE. These words are of
frequent occurrence, and have a great variety
of significations, according to the matter to
which they refer. Their general signification
is that of security given by one person to
another, or security which one person obtains
by the advice or assistance of another.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cautio</i> was most frequently a writing,
which expressed the object of the parties to
it; accordingly the word cautio came to signify
both the instrument (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chirographum</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">instrumentum</i>) and the object which it was
the purpose of the instrument to secure.
Cicero uses the expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cautio chirographi
mei</i>. The phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavere aliquid alicui</i> expressed
the fact of one person giving security
to another as to some particular thing or act.
The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cautio</i> was also applied to the release
which a debtor obtained from his creditor
on satisfying his demand; in this sense
cautio is equivalent to a modern receipt; it is
the debtor’s security against the same demand
being made a second time. Thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavere ab
aliquo</i> signifies to obtain this kind of security.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cavere</i> is also applied to express the
professional advice and assistance of a lawyer
to his client for his conduct in any legal matter.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cavere</i> and its derivatives are also used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
to express the provisions of a law, by which
any thing is forbidden or ordered, as in the
phrase, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cautum est lege</i>, &amp;c. It is also used
to express the words in a will, by which a
testator declares his wish that certain things
should be done after his death.</p>


<p id="Ceadas">CĔADAS or CAEADAS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεάδας</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καιάδας</span>),

to death.</p>


<p id="Celeres">CĔLĔRES, are said by Livy to have been
three hundred horsemen, who formed the
body-guard of Romulus both in peace and
war. There can, however, be little doubt
that these Celeres were not simply the body-guard
of the king, but were the same as the
equites, or horsemen, a fact which is expressly
stated by some writers. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Equites">Equites</a>.</span>]
The etymology of Celeres is variously given.
Some writers derived it from their leader
Celer, who was said to have slain Remus, but
most writers connected it with the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κέλης</span>, in reference to the quickness of their
service. The Celeres were under the command
of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tribunus Celerum</i>, who stood in
the same relation to the king as the magister
equitum did in a subsequent period to the
dictator. He occupied the second place in
the state, and in the absence of the king had
the right of convoking the comitia. Whether
he was appointed by the king, or elected by
the comitia, has been questioned, but the
former is the more probable.</p>


<p id="Cella">CELLA, in its primary sense, means a
store-room of any kind. Of these there were
various descriptions, which took their distinguishing
denominations from the articles
they contained, as, for instance, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella penuaria</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penaria</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella olearia</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella
vinaria</i>. The slave to whom the charge of
these stores was intrusted, was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cellarius</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promus</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">condus</i>, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quia <em>promit</em>
quod <em>conditum est</em></span>,” and sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promus
condus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">procurator peni</i>. This answers
to our butler and housekeeper. Any number
of small rooms clustered together like the cells
of a honeycomb were also termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cellae</i>;
hence the dormitories of slaves and menials
are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cellae</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cellae familiaricae</i>, in
distinction to a bed-chamber, which was
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubiculum</i>. Thus a sleeping-room at a public-house
is also termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cella ostiarii</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">janitoris</i>, is the porter’s lodge. In the baths
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella caldaria</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tepidaria</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frigidaria</i>,
were those which contained respectively the
warm, tepid, and cold bath. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Balneum">Balneae</a>.</span>]
The interior of a temple, that is the part included
within the outside shell (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σηκός</span>), was
also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i>. There was sometimes more
than one <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i> within the same peristyle or
under the same roof, in which case each cell
took the name of the deity whose statue it
contained, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i> Jovis, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i> Junonis, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i>
Minervae, as in the temple of Jupiter on the
Capitoline.</p>


<p id="Cenotaphium">CĔNOTĂPHĬUM, a cenotaph (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κενός</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάφος</span>), was an empty or honorary tomb,
erected as a memorial of a person whose body
was buried elsewhere, or not found for burial
at all.</p>


<p id="Censor">CENSOR (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τιμητής</span>), the name of two magistrates
of high rank in the Roman republic.
Their office was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Censura</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τιμητεία</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τιμητία</span>). The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Census</i>, which was a register
of Roman citizens and of their property, was
first established by Servius Tullius, the fifth
king of Rome. After the expulsion of the
kings it was taken by the consuls; and special
magistrates were not appointed for the
purpose of taking it till the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 443.
The reason of this alteration was owing to
the appointment in the preceding year of
tribuni militum with consular power in place
of the consuls; and as these tribunes might
be plebeians, the patricians deprived the consuls,
and consequently their representatives,
the tribunes, of the right of taking the census,
and entrusted it to two magistrates, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Censores</i>, who were to be chosen exclusively
from the patricians. The magistracy continued
to be a patrician one till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 351,
when C. Marcius Rutilus was the first plebeian
censor. Twelve years afterwards, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
339, it was provided by one of the Publilian
laws, that one of the censors must necessarily
be a plebeian, but it was not till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 280 that
a plebeian censor performed the solemn purification
of the people (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lustrum condidit</i>). In
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 131 the two censors were for the first
time plebeians.&mdash;The censors were elected in
the comitia centuriata held under the presidency
of a consul. As a general principle,
the only persons eligible to the office were
those who had previously been consuls; but
a few exceptions occur. At first there was
no law to prevent a person being censor a
second time; but the only person, who was
twice elected to the office, was C. Marcius
Rutilus in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 265; and he brought forward
a law in this year, enacting that no one
should be chosen censor a second time, and
received in consequence the surname of Censorinus.&mdash;The
censorship is distinguished
from all other Roman magistracies by the
length of time during which it was held.
The censors were originally chosen for a whole
lustrum, that is, a period of five years; but
their office was limited to eighteen months,
as early as ten years after its institution (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
433), by a law of the dictator Mam. Aemilius
Mamercinus. The censors also held a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
peculiar position with respect to rank and
dignity. No imperium was bestowed upon
them, and accordingly they had no lictors.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus censurae</i> was granted to them by a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex centuriata</i>, and not by the curiae, and in
that respect they were inferior in power to
the consuls and praetors. But notwithstanding
this, the censorship was regarded as the
highest dignity in the state, with the exception
of the dictatorship; it was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctus
magistratus</i>, to which the deepest reverence
was due. They possessed of course the sella
curulis. The funeral of a censor was always
conducted with great pomp and splendour,
and hence a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funus censorium</i> was voted even
to the emperors.&mdash;The censorship continued
in existence for 421 years, namely, from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
443 to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 22; but during this period many
lustra passed by without any censor being
chosen at all. Its power was limited by one
of the laws of the tribune Clodius (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 58).
After the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 22 the emperors discharged
the duties of the censorship under the name
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praefectura Morum</i>.&mdash;The duties of the
censors may be divided into three classes, all
of which were however closely connected with
one another: I. <em>The Census</em>, or register of
the citizens and of their property, in which
were included the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lectio senatus</i>, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recognitio
equitum</i>; II. <em>The Regimen Morum</em>;
and III. <em>The administration of the finances of
the state</em>, under which were classed the superintendence
of the public buildings and the
erection of all new public works.&mdash;I. The
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Census">Census</a></span>, the first and principal duty of the
censors, for which the proper expression is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censum agere</i>, was always held in the Campus
Martius, and from the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 435 in a
special building called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Villa Publica</i>. After
the auspicia had been taken, the citizens were
summoned by a public crier (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praeco</i>) to appear
before the censors. Each tribe was
called up separately, and every paterfamilias
had to appear in person before the censors,
who were seated in their curule chairs. The
census was conducted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad arbitrium censoris</i>;
but the censors laid down certain rules,
sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leges censui censendo</i>, in
which mention was made of the different
kinds of property subject to the census, and
in what way their value was to be estimated.
According to these laws each citizen had to
give an account of himself, of his family, and of
his property upon oath, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex animi sententia</i>.
First he had to give his full name (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praenomen</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognomen</i>) and that of his
father, or if he were a freedman that of his
patron, and he was likewise obliged to state
his age. He was then asked, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tu, ex animi
tui sententia, uxorem habes?</i> and if married
he had to give the name of his wife, and
likewise the number, names, and ages of his
children, if any. Single women (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viduae</i>) and
orphans (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">orbi orbaeque</i>) were represented by
their tutores; their names were entered in
separate lists, and they were not included in
the sum total of capita. After a citizen had
stated his name, age, family, &amp;c., he then
had to give an account of all his property, so
far as it was subject to the census. In making
this statement he was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censere</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censeri</i>,
as a deponent, “to value or estimate
himself,” or as a passive “to be valued or
estimated:” the censor, who received the
statement, was also said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censere</i>, as well as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accipere censum</i>. Only such things were
liable to the census (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censui censendo</i>) as were
property <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex jure Quiritium</i>. Land formed the
most important article in the census; next
came slaves and cattle. The censors also
possessed the right of calling for a return of
such objects as had not usually been given in,
such as clothing, jewels, and carriages. We
can hardly doubt that the censors possessed
the power of setting a higher valuation on the
property than the citizens themselves had
put. The tax (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tributum</i>) was usually one
per thousand upon the property entered in
the books of the censors; but on one occasion
the censors, as a punishment, compelled a
person to pay eight per thousand (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">octuplicato
censu</i>, Liv. iv. 24). A person who voluntarily
absented himself from the census, and
thus became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incensus</i>, was subject to the severest
punishment. It is probable that service
in the army was a valid excuse for absence.
After the censors had received the
names of all the citizens with the amount of
their property, they then had to make out the
lists of the tribes, and also of the classes and
centuries; for by the legislation of Servius
Tullius the position of each citizen in the
state was determined by the amount of his
property. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Comitia_ce">Comitia Centuriata</a>.</span>] These
lists formed a most important part of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabulae Censoriae</i>, under which name were
included all the documents connected in any
way with the discharge of the censors’ duties.
These lists, as far at least as they were connected
with the finances of the state, were
deposited in the aerarium, which was the
temple of Saturn; but the regular depository
for all the archives of the censors was in
earlier times the Atrium Libertatis, near the
Villa publica, and in later times the temple of
the Nymphs. The censors had also to make
out the lists of the senators for the ensuing
lustrum, or till new censors were appointed;
striking out the names of such as they considered
unworthy, and making additions to
the body from those who were qualified.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Senatus">Senatus</a>.</span>] In the same manner they held a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
review of the equites equo publico, and added
and removed names as they judged proper.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Equites">Equites</a>.</span>] After the lists had been completed,
the number of citizens was counted
up, and the sum total announced; and accordingly
we find that, in the account of a
census, the number of citizens is likewise
usually given. They are in such cases spoken
of as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capita</i>, sometimes with the addition of
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civium</i>, and sometimes not; and
hence to be registered in the census was the
same thing as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput habere</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Caput">Caput</a>.</span>]&mdash;II.
<span class="smcap">Regimen Morum.</span> This was the most important
branch of the censors’ duties, and the
one which caused their office to be the most
revered and the most dreaded in the Roman
state. It naturally grew out of the right
which they possessed of excluding unworthy
persons from the lists of citizens. They
were constituted the conservators of public
and private virtue and morality; they were
not simply to prevent crime or particular acts
of immorality, but their great object was to
maintain the old Roman character and habits,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mos majorum</i>. The proper expression for
this branch of their power was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">regimen morum</i>,
which was called in the times of the
empire <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cura</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectura morum</i>. The
punishment inflicted by the censors in the
exercise of this branch of their duties was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nota</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Notatio</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Animadversio
Censoria</i>. In inflicting it they were guided
only by their conscientious convictions of
duty; they had to take an oath that they
would act neither through partiality nor favour;
and in addition to this, they were
bound in every case to state in their lists,
opposite the name of the guilty citizen, the
cause of the punishment inflicted on him,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Subscriptio
censoria</i>. The consequence of
such a nota was only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignominia</i> and not infamia
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Infamia">Infamia</a></span>], and the censorial verdict
was not a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicium</i> or res <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicata</i>, for its
effects were not lasting, but might be removed
by the following censors, or by a lex.
A nota censoria was moreover not valid, unless
both censors agreed. The ignominia was
thus only a transitory capitis deminutio,
which does not appear even to have deprived
a magistrate of his office, and certainly did
not disqualify persons labouring under it for
obtaining a magistracy, for being appointed
as judices by the praetor, or for serving in
the Roman armies. This superintendence of
the conduct of Roman citizens extended so
far, that it embraced the whole of the public
and private life of the citizens. Thus we
have instances of their censuring or punishing
persons for not marrying, for breaking a
promise of marriage, for divorce, for bad conduct
during marriage, for improper education
of children, for living in an extravagant and
luxurious manner, and for many other irregularities
in private life. Their influence was
still more powerful in matters connected with
the public life of the citizens. Thus we find
them censuring or punishing magistrates who
were forgetful of the dignity of their office or
guilty of bribery, as well as persons who
were guilty of improper conduct towards magistrates,
of perjury, and of neglect of their
duties both in civil and military life. The
punishments inflicted by the censors are generally
divided into four classes:&mdash;1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Motio</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ejectio e senatu</i>, or the exclusion of a man
from the number of senators. This punishment
might either be a simple exclusion from
the list of senators, or the person might at
the same time be excluded from the tribes
and degraded to the rank of an aerarian.
The censors in their new lists omitted the
names of such senators as they wished to
exclude, and in reading these new lists in
public, passed over the names of those who
were no longer to be senators. Hence the
expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praeteriti senatores</i> is equivalent
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e senatu ejecti</i>. 2. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ademptio equi</i>, or
the taking away the equus publicus from an
eques. This punishment might likewise be
simple, or combined with the exclusion from
the tribes and the degradation to the rank of
an aerarian. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Equites">Equites</a>.</span>] 3. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">motio e
tribu</i>, or the exclusion of a person from his
tribe. If the further degradation to the rank
of an aerarian was combined with the motio
e tribu, it was always expressly stated. 4.
The fourth punishment was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">referre in
aerarios</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facere aliquem aerarium</i>, and
might be inflicted on any person who was
thought by the censors to deserve it. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aerarii">Aerarii</a>.</span>]&mdash;III.
<span class="smcap">The Administration of the Finances
of the State</span>, was another part of
the censors’ office. In the first place the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tributum</i>, or property-tax, had to be paid by
each citizen according to the amount of his
property registered in the census, and, accordingly,
the regulation of this tax naturally
fell under the jurisdiction of the censors.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tributum">Tributum</a>.</span>] They also had the superintendence
of all the other revenues of the state, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vectigalia</i>, such as the tithes paid for the
public lands, the salt-works, the mines, the
customs, &amp;c. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Vectigalia">Vectigalia</a>.</span>] All these branches
of the revenue the censors were accustomed
to let out to the highest bidder for the space
of a lustrum or five years. The act of letting
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venditio</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locatio</i>, and seems to
have taken place in the month of March.
The censors also possessed the right, though
probably not without the concurrence of the
senate, of imposing new vectigalia, and even
of selling the land belonging to the state.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
The censors, however, did not receive the revenues
of the state. All the public money
was paid into the aerarium, which was entirely
under the jurisdiction of the senate;
and all disbursements were made by order of
this body, which employed the quaestors as
its officers. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aerarium">Aerarium</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Senatus">Senatus</a></span>.]&mdash;In one
important department the censors were entrusted
with the expenditure of the public
money; though the actual payments were
no doubt made by the quaestors. The censors
had the general superintendence of all
the public buildings and works (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opera publica</i>);
and to meet the expenses connected
with this part of their duties, the senate voted
them a certain sum of money or certain revenues,
to which they were restricted, but
which they might at the same time employ
according to their discretion. They had to
see that the temples and all other public buildings
were in a good state of repair (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aedes
sacras tueri</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sarta tecta exigere</i>), that no
public places were encroached upon by the
occupation of private persons (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loca tueri</i>), and
that the aquaeducts, roads, drains, &amp;c. were
properly attended to. The repairs of the
public works and the keeping of them in proper
condition were let out by the censors by
public auction to the lowest bidder. The
persons who undertook the contract were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conductores</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">redemptores</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">susceptores</i>, &amp;c.; and the duties they had to
discharge were specified in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Censoriae</i>.
The censors had also to superintend
the expenses connected with the worship of
the gods. In these respects it is not easy to
define with accuracy the respective duties of
the censors and aediles: but it may be remarked
in general that the superintendence
of the aediles had more of a police character,
while that of the censors had reference to all
financial matters.&mdash;After the censors had performed
their various duties and taken the
census, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lustrum</i> or solemn purification of
the people followed. When the censors entered
upon their office, they drew lots to see
which of them should perform this purification
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lustrum facere</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">condere</i>), but both
censors were obliged of course to be present
at the ceremony. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lustrum">Lustrum</a>.</span>]&mdash;In the Roman
and Latin colonies and in the municipia
there were censors, who likewise bore the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinquennales</i>. They are spoken of
under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Colonia">Colonia</a></span>. A census was sometimes
taken in the provinces, even under the republic;
but there seems to have been no
general census taken in the provinces till the
time of Augustus. At Rome the census still
continued to be taken under the empire, but
the old ceremonies connected with it were no
longer continued, and the ceremony of the
lustration was not performed after the time
of Vespasian.&mdash;The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">census</i>, besides the
meaning of “valuation” of a person’s estate,
has other significations, which must be briefly
mentioned: 1. It signified the amount of a
person’s property, and hence we read of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">census senatorius</i>, the estate of a senator;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">census equestris</i>, the estate of an eques.
2. The lists of the censors. 3. The tax
which depended upon the valuation in the
census.</p>


<p id="Census">CENSUS.&mdash;(1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>&mdash;The Greek term
for a man’s property as ascertained by the
census, as well as for the act of ascertaining
it, is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τίμημα</span>. The only Greek state concerning
whose arrangement of the census we have
any satisfactory information, is Athens. Previous
to the time of Solon no census had been
instituted at Athens. According to his census,
all citizens were divided into four classes:
1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentacosiomedimni</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πεντακοσιομέδιμνοι</span>),
or persons possessing landed property which
yielded an annual income of at least 500
medimni of dry or liquid produce. 2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippeis</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἱππεῖς</span>), i.e. knights or persons able
to keep a war-horse, were those whose lands
yielded an annual produce of at least 300 medimni,
whence they are also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριακοσιομέδιμνοι</span>.
3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zeugitae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζευγῖται</span>), i.e. persons
able to keep a yoke of oxen (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζεῦγος</span>), were
those whose annual income consisted of at
least 150 medimni. 4. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thetes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θῆτες</span>)
contained all the rest of the free population,
whose income was below that of the Zeugitae.
The constitution of Athens, so long as it was
based upon these classes, was a timocracy
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τιμοκρατία</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ τιμημάτων πολιτεία</span>). The
highest magistracy at Athens, or the archonship,
was at first accessible only to persons
of the first class, until Aristides threw all the
state offices open to all classes indiscriminately.
The maintenance of the republic
mainly devolved upon the first three classes,
the last being exempted from all taxes. As
the land in the legislation of Solon was regarded
as the capital which yielded an annual
income, he regulated his system of taxation
by the value of the land, which was treated
as the taxable capital. Lists of this taxable
property (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπογραφαί</span>) were kept at first by
the naucrari, who also had to conduct the
census, and afterwards by the demarchi.&mdash;As
property is a fluctuating thing, the census
was repeated from time to time, but the
periods differed in the various parts of
Greece, for in some a census was held every
year, and in others every two or four years.
At Athens every person had to state the

doubt about his honesty, it seems that a
counter-valuation (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιτίμησις</span>) might be made.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
This system of taxation according to classes,
and based upon the possession of productive
estates, underwent a considerable change in
the time of the Peloponnesian war, though the
divisions into classes themselves continued
to be observed for a considerable time after.
As the wants of the republic increased, and
as many citizens were possessed of large
property, without being landed proprietors,
the original land-tax was changed into a
property-tax. This property-tax was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφορά</span>, concerning which see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Eisphora">Eisphora</a></span>.

<p id="Centesima">CENTESĬMA, namely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pars</i>, or the hundredth
part, also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vectigal rerum venalium</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centesima rerum venalium</i>, was a tax
of one per cent. levied at Rome and in Italy
upon all goods that were exposed for public
sale at auctions. It was collected by persons
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coactores</i>. This tax was perhaps introduced
after the civil war between Marius
and Sulla. Its produce was assigned by
Augustus to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aerarium militare</i>. Tiberius
reduced the tax to one half per cent. (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ducentesima</i>),
after he had changed Cappadocia
into a province, and had thereby increased
the revenue of the empire. Caligula in the
beginning of his reign abolished the tax altogether
for Italy.</p>

<p id="Centumviri">CENTUMVĬRI, were judices, who resembled
other judices in this respect, that they
decided cases under the authority of a magistratus;
but they differed from other judices
in being a definite body or collegium. This
collegium seems to have been divided into
four parts, each of which sometimes sat by
itself. The origin of the court is unknown.
According to an ancient writer, three were
chosen out of each tribe, and consequently
the whole number out of the 35 tribes would
be 105, who, in round numbers, were called
the hundred men. If the centumviri were
chosen from the tribes, this seems a strong
presumption in favour of the high antiquity
of the court. It was the practice to set up a
spear in the place where the centumviri were
sitting, and accordingly the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta centumviralis</i>, is sometimes used as
equivalent to the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicium centumvirale</i>.
The praetor presided in this court.
The jurisdiction of the centumviri was chiefly
confined to civil matters, but it appears that
crimina sometimes came under their cognizance.
The younger Pliny, who practised
in this court, makes frequent allusions to it
in his letters.</p>

<p id="Cerealia">CĔRĔĀLĬA, a festival celebrated at Rome
in honour of Ceres, whose wanderings in
search of her lost daughter Proserpine were
represented by women, clothed in white, running
about with lighted torches. During its
continuance, games were celebrated in the
Circus Maximus, the spectators of which appeared
in white; but on any occasion of
public mourning the games and festivals were
not celebrated at all, as the matrons could
not appear at them except in white. The
day of the Cerealia is doubtful; some think
it was the ides or 13th of April, others the
7th of the same month.</p>


<p id="Cerevisia">CĔRĔVĪSĬA, CERVĪSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζύθος</span>), ale or
beer, was almost or altogether unknown to
the Greeks and Romans; but it was used very
generally by the surrounding nations, whose
soil and climate were less favourable to the
growth of vines. According to Herodotus, the
Egyptians commonly drank “barley wine;”
and Diodorus Siculus says that the Egyptian
beer was nearly equal to wine in strength and
flavour. The Iberians and Thracians, and the
people in the north of Asia Minor, instead of
drinking their beer out of cups, placed it
before them in a large bowl or vase, which
was sometimes of gold or silver. This being
full to the brim with the grains, as well as
the fermented liquor, the guests, when they
pledged one another, drank together out of
the same bowl by stooping down to it,
although, when this token of friendship was
not intended, they adopted the more refined
method of sucking up the fluid through tubes
of cane. The Suevi and other northern nations
offered to their gods libations of beer,
and expected that to drink it in the presence
of Odin would be among the delights of
Valhalla.</p>


<p id="Ceroma">CĒRŌMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κήρωμα</span>), the oil mixed with

<p id="Cetra">CETRA, or CAETRA, a target, <em>i.e.</em> a small
round shield, made of the hide of a quadruped.
It formed part of the defensive armour
of the Osci, and of the people of Spain, Mauritania,
and Britain, and seems to have been
much the same as the target of the Scotch
Highlanders. The Romans do not appear to
have used the cetra; but we find mention of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cetratae cohortes</i> levied in the provinces.

(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χαλκίοικος</span>), i.e. the goddess of the brazen-house.
Young men marched on the occasion
in full armour to the temple of the goddess;
and the ephors, although not entering the
temple, but remaining within its sacred precincts,
were obliged to take part in the
sacrifice.</p>


<p id="Chalcus">CHALCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκοῦς</span>), a denomination of
Greek copper-money. Bronze or copper (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκός</span>)
was very little used by the Greeks for
money till after the time of Alexander the
Great. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκία πονηρὰ</span> at Athens issued
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 406 were a peculiar exception; and
they were soon afterwards called in, and the
silver currency restored. It is not improbable,
however, that the copper coin called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκοῦς</span>
was in circulation in Athens still earlier.
The smallest silver coin at Athens was the
quarter-obol, and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκοῦς</span> was the half of
that, or the eighth of an obol. Its value was
somewhat more than 3-4ths of a farthing.
The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκοῦς</span> in later times was divided into
lepta, of which it contained seven. In later
times the obol was coined of copper as well as
silver.</p>


<p id="Charistia">CHĂRISTĬA (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαρίζομαι</span>, to grant a
favour or pardon), a solemn feast among the
Romans, to which none but relations and
members of the same family were invited, in
order that any quarrel or disagreement which
had arisen amongst them might be made up.
The day of celebration was the 19th of February.</p>


<p id="Cheironomia">CHEIRŎNŎMĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειρονομία</span>), a mimetic
movement of the hands, which formed a part
of the art of dancing among the Greeks and
Romans. In gymnastics it was applied to
the movements of the hands in pugilistic
combat.</p>


<p id="Cheirotonia">CHEIRŎTŎNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</span>). In the
Athenian assemblies two modes of voting were
practised, the one by pebbles (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψηφίζεσθαι</span>),
the other by a show of hands (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονεῖν</span>).
The latter was employed in the election of
those magistrates who were chosen in the
public assemblies, and who were hence called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονητοί</span>, in voting upon laws, and in
some kinds of trials on matters which concerned
the people. We frequently find, however,
the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψηφίζεσθαι</span> used where the
votes were really given by show of hands.
The manner of voting by a show of hands
was as follows:&mdash;The herald said: “Whoever
thinks that Meidias is guilty, let him
lift up his hand.” Then those who thought
so stretched forth their hands. Then the
herald said again: “Whoever thinks that
Meidias is not guilty, let him lift up his
hand;” and those who were of this opinion
stretched forth their hands. The number of
hands was counted each time by the herald;
and the president, upon the herald’s report,
declared on which side the majority voted.
It is important to understand clearly the
compounds of this word. A vote condemning
an accused person is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταχειροτονία</span>: one acquitting
him, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποχειροτονία</span>; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειροτονεῖν</span> is
to confirm by a majority of votes: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειροτονία
τῶν νομῶν</span> was a revision of the laws,
which took place at the beginning of every year:
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειροτονία τῶν ἀρχῶν</span> was a vote taken in the
first assembly of each prytany on the conduct
of the magistrates; in these cases, those who
voted for the confirmation of the law, or for
the continuance in office of the magistrate,
were said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιχειροτονεῖν</span>, those on the other
side <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποχειροτονεῖν</span>: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαχειροτονία</span> is a vote for
one of two alternatives: <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιχειροτονεῖν</span>, to
vote against a proposition. The compounds
of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψηφίζεσθαι</span> have similar meanings.</p>


<p id="Chirographum">CHĪRŎGRĂPHUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειρόγραφον</span>), meant
first, as its derivation implies, a hand-writing
or autograph. In this its simple sense, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χείρ</span>
in Greek and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manus</i> in Latin are often substituted
for it. From this meaning was easily
derived that of a signature to a will or other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
instrument, especially a note of hand given
by a debtor to his creditor.</p>

<p id="Chlamys">CHLĂMỸS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χλαμύς</span>, <em>dim.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χλαμύδιον</span>), a
scarf, denoted an article of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amictus</i>, or
outer raiment of the Greeks. It was for the
most part woollen; and it differed from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">himation</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον</span>), or cloak, the usual amictus
of the male sex, in being smaller, finer, and
oblong instead of square, its length being
generally about twice its breadth. The scarf
does not appear to have been much worn by
children. It was generally assumed on
reaching adolescence, and was worn by the
ephebi from about seventeen to twenty years
of age, and hence was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χλαμὺς ἐφηβηική</span>.
It was also worn by the military, especially
of high rank, over their body armour, and by
hunters and travellers, more particularly on
horseback. The usual mode of wearing the
scarf was to pass one of its shorter sides
round the neck, and to fasten it by means of
a brooch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fibula</i>), either over the breast (cut,
<span class="smcap"><a href="#ill200b">Hasta</a></span>), in which case it hung down the back,
or over the right shoulder, so as to cover the
left arm (cut, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Causia">Causia</a></span>). In the following cut
it is worn again in another way. The aptitude
of the scarf to be turned in every possible
form around the body, made it useful
even for defence. The hunter used to wrap
his chlamys about his left arm when pursuing
wild animals, and preparing to fight with
them. The annexed woodcut exhibits a
figure of Neptune armed with the trident in
his right hand, and having a chlamys to
protect the left. When Diana goes to the
chase, as she does not require her scarf for
purposes of defence, she draws it from behind
over her shoulders, and twists it round her
waist so that the belt of her quiver passes across
it. (See <a href="#ill084b">woodcut</a>.) Among the Romans the
scarf came more into use under the emperors.
Caligula wore one enriched with gold.
Severus, when he was in the country or on
an expedition, wore a scarf dyed with the
coccus.</p>

<p id="Choenix">CHOENIX (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χοῖνιξ</span>), a Greek measure of
capacity, the size of which is differently
given; it was probably of different sizes in
the several states. Some writers make it
equal to three cotylae (nearly 1½ pints English);
others to four cotylae (nearly 2 pints
English); others again make it eight cotylae
(nearly 4 pints English).</p>


<p id="Choregus">CHŎRĒGUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χορηγός</span>), a person who had
to bear the expenses of the choregia (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χορηγία</span>),
one of the regularly recurring state burthens
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐγκύκλιοι λειτουργίαι</span>) at Athens. The choregus
was appointed by his tribe, though we
are not informed according to what order.
The same person might serve as choregus for
two tribes at once; and after <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 412 a decree
was passed allowing two persons to unite
and undertake a choregia together. The duties
of the choregia consisted in providing
the choruses for tragedies and comedies, the
lyric choruses of men and boys, the pyrrhicists,
the cyclic choruses, and the choruses of
flute-players for the different religious festivals
at Athens. When a poet intended to
bring out a play, he had to get a chorus assigned
him by the archon [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a></span>], who
nominated a choregus to fulfil the requisite
duties. He had first to collect his chorus,
and then to procure a teacher (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χοροδιδάσκαλος</span>),
whom he paid for instructing the choreutae.
The chorus were generally maintained, during
the period of their instruction, at the expense
of the choregus. The choregus who exhibited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the best musical or theatrical entertainment
received as a prize a tripod, which he
had the expense of consecrating, and sometimes
he had also to build the monument on
which it was placed. There was a whole
street at Athens formed by the line of these
tripod-temples, and called “The Street of the
Tripods.”</p>

<p id="Chorus">CHŎRUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χορός</span>) probably signified originally
a company of dancers dancing in a ring.
In later times, a choric performance always
implies the singing or musical recitation of a
poetical composition, accompanied by appropriate
dancing and gesticulation, or at least
by a measured march. In all the Dorian
states, especially among the Spartans, choral
performances were cultivated with great assiduity.
Various causes contributed to this, as,
for example, their universal employment in
the worship of Apollo, the fact that they were
not confined to the men, but that women
also took part in them, and that many of the
dances had a gymnastic character given them,
and were employed as a mode of training to
martial exercises. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Saltatio">Saltatio</a>.</span>] Hence Doric
lyric poetry became almost exclusively choral,
which was not the case with the other great
school of Greek lyric poetry, the Aeolian; so
that the Doric dialect came to be looked upon
as the appropriate dialect for choral compositions,
and Doric forms were retained by the
Athenians even in the choral compositions
which were interwoven with their dramas.
The instrument commonly used in connection
with the Doric choral poetry was the cithara.
A great impetus was given to choral poetry
by its application to the dithyramb. This ancient
Bacchanalian performance seems to have
been a hymn sung by one or more of an irregular
band of revellers, to the music of the
flute. Arion, a contemporary of Periander,
was the first who gave a regular choral form
to the dithyramb. This chorus, which ordinarily
consisted of fifty men or youths, danced
in a ring round the altar of Dionysus. Hence
such choruses were termed <em>cyclic</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύκλιοι
χοροί</span>). With the introduction of a regular
choral character, Arion also substituted the
cithara for the flute. It was from the dithyramb
that the Attic tragedy was developed.
For details see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Tragoedia">Tragoedia</a></span>. From the time
of Sophocles onwards the regular number of
the chorus in a tragedy was 15; but it is
impossible to arrive at any definite conclusion
with regard to the number of the chorus in
the early dramas of Aeschylus. The fact
that the number of the dithyrambic chorus
was 50, and that the mythological number
of the Oceanides and Danaides was the same,
tempts one to suppose that the chorus in the
Prometheus and the Supplices consisted of
50. Most writers, however, agree in thinking
that such a number was too large to have
been employed. The later chorus of 15 was
arranged in a quadrangular form (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετράγωνος</span>).
It entered the theatre by the passage
to the right of the spectators. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Theatrum">Theatrum</a>.</span>]
Its entrance was termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάροδος</span>; its leaving
the stage in the course of the play <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετάστασις</span>;
its re-entrance <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιπάροδος</span>; its exit <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄφοδος</span>.
As it entered in three lines, with the spectators
on its left, the stage on its right, the
middle choreutes of the left row (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίτος ἀριστέρου</span>)
was the Coryphaeus or Hegemon, who
in early times at least was not unfrequently
the choregus himself. Of course the positions
first taken up by the choreutae were
only retained till they commenced their evolutions.
To guide them in these, lines were
marked upon the boards with which the
orchestra was floored. The flute as well as
the cithara was used as an accompaniment to
the choric songs. The dance of the tragic
chorus was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐμμέλεια</span>.&mdash;The ordinary
number of the chorus in a comedy was 24.
Like the tragic chorus it was arranged in a
quadrangular form, and entered the orchestra
from opposite sides, according as it was supposed
to come from the city or from the
country. It consisted sometimes half of male
and half of female choreutae. The dance of
the comic chorus was the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόρδαξ</span>. In the
Satyric drama the chorus consisted of Satyrs:
its number is quite uncertain. Its dance was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σίκιννις</span>. When a poet intended to
bring forward a play, he had to apply for a
chorus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χορὸν αἰτεῖν</span>) to the archons, to the
king archon if the play was to be brought
forward at the Lenaea, to the archon eponymus
if at the great Dionysia. If the play
were thought to deserve it, he received a
chorus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χορὸν λαμβάνειν</span>), the expenses of
which were borne by a choregus. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Choregus">Choregus</a>.</span>]
The poet then either trained (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διδάσκειν</span>)
the chorus himself, or entrusted that business
to a professed chorus trainer (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χοροδιδάσκαλος</span>),
who usually had an assistant (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποδιδάσκαλος</span>).
For training the chorus in its evolutions there
was also an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀρχηστοδιδάσκαλος</span>.</p>


<p id="Chous">CHOUS, or CHOEUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χοῦς</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χοεῦς</span>), was
equal to the Roman congius, and contained six
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξέσται</span>, or sextarii (nearly six pints English).
It seems that there was also a smaller measure
of the same name, containing two sextarii
(nearly two pints English).</p>


<p id="Chronologia">CHRŎNOLŎGĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρονολογία</span>), chronology.
The Greeks reckoned their years generally
according to their magistrates, in the early
times according to the years of the reign of
their kings, and afterwards according to their
annual magistrates. At Athens the year was
called by the name of one of the nine archons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
who from this circumstance was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων
ἐπώνυμος</span>, or the archon par excellence; and
at Sparta the years were called after one of
the five ephors, who for this reason was likewise
termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπώνυμος</span>. In Argos time was
counted according to the years of the high
priestess of Hera, who held her office for life
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡρεσίς</span>); and the inhabitants of Elis probably
reckoned according to the Olympic games,
which were celebrated every fifth year during
the first full moon which followed after the
summer solstice. Thus there was no era
which was used by <em>all</em> the Greeks in common
for the ordinary purposes of life.&mdash;Timaeus,
who flourished about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 260, was the first
historian who counted the years by Olympiads,
each of which contained four years.
The beginning of the Olympiads is commonly
fixed in the year 3938 of the Julian period,
or in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 776. If we want to reduce any
given Olympiad to years before Christ, <em>e.g.</em>
Ol. 87, we take the number of the Olympiads
actually elapsed, that is, 86, multiply it by 4,
and deduct the number obtained from 776, so
that the first year of the 87th Ol. will be the
same as the year 432 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> If the number of
Olympiads amounts to more than 776 years,
that is, if the Olympiad falls after the birth
of Christ, the process is the same as before,
but from the sum obtained by multiplying
the Olympiads by 4, we must deduct the
number 776, and what remains is the number
of the years after Christ. As the Olympic
games were celebrated 293 times, we have
293 Olympic cycles, that is, 1172 years, 776
of which fall before, and 396 after Christ.&mdash;Some
writers also adopted the Trojan era, the
fall of Troy being placed by Eratosthenes and
those who adopted this era, in the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
1184. After the time of Alexander the Great,
several other eras were introduced in the
kingdoms that arose out of his empire. The
first was the Philippic era, sometimes also
called the era of Alexander or the era of
Edessa; it began on the 12th of November
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 324, the date of the accession of Philip
Arrhidaeus. The second was the era of the
Seleucidae, beginning on the 1st of October
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 312, the date of the victory of Seleucus
Nicator at Gaza, and of his re-conquest of
Babylonia. This era was used very extensively
in the East. The Chaldaean era differed
from it only by six months, beginning
in the spring of <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 311. Lastly, the eras of
Antioch, of which there were three, but the
one most commonly used began in November
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 49.&mdash;The Romans during the time of the
republic reckoned their years by the names
of the consuls, which were registered in the
Fasti. Along with this era there existed
another, used only by the historians. It
reckoned the years from the foundation of the
city (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab urbe condita</i>); but the year of the
foundation of the city was a question of uncertainty
among the Romans themselves. M.
Terentius Varro placed it on the 21st of April
in the third year of the 6th Olympiad, that
is, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 753; and this is the era most commonly
used. To find out the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> corresponding
to the year <span class="allsmcap">A.U.C.</span>, subtract the year
<span class="allsmcap">A.U.C.</span> from 754; thus 605 <span class="allsmcap">A.U.C.</span> = 149 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
To find out the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> corresponding to
the year <span class="allsmcap">A.U.C.</span>, subtract 753 from the year
<span class="allsmcap">A.U.C.</span>; thus 767 <span class="allsmcap">A.U.C.</span> = 14 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span></p>

</div>

<p id="Circus">CIRCUS. When Tarquinius Priscus had
taken the town of Apiolae from the Latins,
he commemorated his success by an exhibition
of races and pugilistic contests in the
Murcian valley, between the Palatine and
Aventine hills, around which a number of
temporary platforms were erected by the
patres and equites, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectacula</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fori</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foruli</i>, from their resemblance to the deck of
a ship; each one raising a stage for himself,
upon which he stood to view the games.
This course, with its surrounding scaffoldings,
was termed circus; either because the spectators
stood round to see the shows, or because
the procession and races went round in
a circuit. Previously, however, to the death
of Tarquin, a permanent building was constructed
for the purpose, with regular tiers
of seats in the form of a theatre. To this the
name of Circus Maximus was subsequently
given, as a distinction from the Flaminian
and other similar buildings, which it surpassed
in extent and splendour; and hence
it is often spoken of as <em>the</em> Circus, without
any distinguishing epithet. Of the Circus
Maximus scarcely a vestige now remains;
but this loss is fortunately supplied by the
remains of a small circus on the Via Appia,
the ground-plan of which is in a state of considerable
preservation: it is represented in
the annexed cut, and may be taken as a model
of all others. Around the double lines
(A, A) were arranged the seats (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gradus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sedilia</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subsellia</i>), as in a theatre, termed collectively
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavea</i>; the lowest of which were
separated from the ground by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">podium</i>, and
the whole divided longitudinally by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praecinctiones</i>,
and diagonally into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cunei</i>, with their
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vomitoria</i> attached to each. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</a>.</span>]
Towards the extremity of the upper
branch of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavea</i>, the general outline is
broken by an outwork (B), which was probably
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulvinar</i>, or station for the emperor,
as it is placed in the best situation for
seeing both the commencement and end of
the course, and in the most prominent part
of the circus. In the opposite branch is observed
another interruption to the uniform
line of seats (C), betokening also, from its
construction, a place of distinction; which
might have been assigned to the person at
whose expense the games were given (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">editor
spectaculorum</i>). In the centre of the area
was a low wall (D) running lengthways down
the course, which, from its resemblance to
the position of the dorsal bone in the human
frame, was termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spina</i>. At each extremity
of the spina were placed, upon a base (E, E),
three wooden cylinders, of a conical shape,
like cypress trees, which were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metae</i>&mdash;the
goals. Their situation is distinctly seen
in the cut on <a href="#ill089">p. 89</a>. The most remarkable
objects upon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spina</i> were two columns (F)
supporting seven conical balls, which, from
their resemblance to eggs, were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ova</i>.
Their use was to enable the spectators to
count the number of rounds which had been
run; and they were seven in number, because
seven was the number of the circuits
made in each race. As each round was run,
one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ova</i> was either put up or taken
down. An egg was adopted for this purpose,
in honour of Castor and Pollux. At the
other extremity of the spina were two similar
columns (G), sustaining dolphins, termed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delphinae</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delphinarum columnae</i>, which
do not appear to have been intended to be
removed, but only placed there as corresponding
ornaments to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ova</i>; and the figure
of the dolphin was selected in honour of
Neptune. These figures are also seen in the
cut on <a href="#ill089">p. 89</a>. At the extremity of the circus
in which the two horns of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavea</i> terminate,
were placed the stalls for the horses and
chariots (H, H), commonly called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carceres</i>,
but more anciently the whole line of building
at this end of the circus was termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oppidum</i>:
hence in the circus, of which the plan is
given above, we find two towers (I, I) at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
each end of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carceres</i>. The number of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carceres</i> is supposed to have been usually
twelve, as in this plan.</p>

  <div class="caption">Carceres, with Gates open. (Marble in British Museum.)</div>
</div>

<p>They were vaults,
closed in front by gates of open wood-work
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cancelli</i>), which were opened simultaneously
upon the signal being given, by removing a
rope attached to pilasters of the kind called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermae</i>, placed for that purpose between
each stall, upon which the gates were immediately
thrown open by a number of men, as
represented in the preceding woodcut. The
cut below represents a set of four <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carceres</i>,
with their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermae</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cancelli</i> open, as left
after the chariots had started; in which the
gates are made to open inwards. The preceding
account and woodcuts will be sufficient
to explain the meaning of the various words
by which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carceres</i> were designated in
poetical language, namely, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">claustra</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crypta</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fauces</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fores carceris</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repagula</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">limina
equorum</i>. There were five entrances to the
circus; one (L) in the centre of the carceres,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porta pompae</i>, because it was the one
through which the Circensian procession entered,
and the others at M, M, N, and O. At
the entrance of the course, exactly in the
direction of the line (J, K), were two small
pedestals (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hermuli</i>) on each side of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">podium</i>,
to which was attached a chalked rope
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alba linea</i>), for the purpose of making the
start fair, precisely as is practised at Rome
for the horse-races during Carnival. Thus,
when the doors of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carceres</i> were thrown
open, if any of the horses rushed out before
the others, they were brought up by this rope
until the whole were fairly abreast, when it
was loosened from one side, and all poured
into the course at once. This line was also
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calx</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">creta</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metae</i> served
only to regulate the turnings of the course,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alba linea</i> answered to the starting and
winning post of modern days.&mdash;From this
description the Circus Maximus differed little,
except in size and magnificence of embellishment.
The numbers which the Circus Maximus
was capable of containing are computed
at 150,000 by Dionysius, 260,000 by Pliny,
and 385,000 by P. Victor, all of which are
probably correct, but have reference to different
periods of its history. Its length, in
the time of Julius Caesar, was three stadia,
the width one, and the depth of the buildings
occupied half a stadium. When the Circus
Maximus was permanently formed by Tarquinius
Priscus, each of the thirty curiae had
a particular place assigned to it; but as no
provision was made for the plebeians in this
circus, it is supposed that the Circus Flaminius
was designed for the games of the commonalty,
who in early times chose their tribunes
there, on the Flaminian field. However,
in the latter days of the republic, these invidious
distinctions were lost, and all classes
sat promiscuously in the circus. The seats
were then marked off at intervals by a line
or groove drawn across them (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linea</i>), so that
the space included between two lines afforded
sitting room for a certain number of spectators.
Under the empire, however, the senators
and equites were separated from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
common people. The seat of the emperor
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulvinar or cubiculum</i>) was most likely in
the same situation in the Circus Maximus as
in the one above described.&mdash;The Circensian
games (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ludi Circenses</i>) were first instituted
by Romulus, according to the legends, when
he wished to attract the Sabine population to
Rome, for the purpose of furnishing his own
people with wives, and were celebrated in
honour of the god Consus, or Neptunus
Equestris, from whom they were styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Consuales</i>.
But after the construction of the
Circus Maximus they were called indiscriminately
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Circenses</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romani</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magni</i>. They
embraced six kinds of games:&mdash;I. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus_i">Cursus</a></span>;
II. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus_ii">Ludus Trojae</a></span>; III. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus_iii">Pugna Equestris</a></span>;
IV. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus_iv">Certamen Gymnicum</a></span>; V. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus_v">Venatio</a></span>; VI.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus_vi">Naumachia</a></span>. The two last were not peculiar
to the circus, but were exhibited also in the
amphitheatre, or in buildings appropriated
for them. The games commenced with a
grand procession (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompa Circensis</i>), in which
all those who were about to exhibit in the
circus, as well as persons of distinction, bore
a part. The statues of the gods formed the
most conspicuous feature in the show, which
were paraded upon wooden platforms, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fercula</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thensae</i>. The former were borne
upon the shoulders, as the statues of saints
are carried in modern processions; the latter
were drawn along upon wheels.&mdash;I. <span id="Circus_i" class="smcap">Cursus</span>,
the races. The carriage usually employed in
the circus was drawn by two or four horses
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bigae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrigae</i>). [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Currus">Currus</a>.</span>] The usual
number of chariots which started for each
race was four. The drivers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurigae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agitatores</i>)
were also divided into four companies,
each distinguished by a different colour, to
represent the four seasons of the year, and
called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factio</i>: thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factio prasina</i>, the green,
represented the spring; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factio russata</i>, red,
the summer; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factio veneta</i>, azure, the autumn;
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factio alba</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albata</i>, white, the
winter. Originally there were but two factions,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albata</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">russata</i>, and consequently
only two chariots started at each race. The
driver stood in his car within the reins, which
went round his back. This enabled him to
throw all his weight against the horses, by
leaning backwards; but it greatly enhanced
his danger in case of an upset. To avoid
this peril, a sort of knife or bill-hook was
carried at the waist, for the purpose of cutting
the reins in a case of emergency. When
all was ready, the doors of the carceres were
flung open, and the chariots were formed
abreast of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alba linea</i> by men called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">moratores</i>
from their duty; the signal for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
start was then given by the person who presided
at the games, sometimes by sound of
trumpet, or more usually by letting fall a
napkin; whence the Circensian games are
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectacula mappae</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alba linea</i>
was then cast off, and the race commenced,
the extent of which was seven times round
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spina</i>, keeping it always on the left. A
course of seven circuits was termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unus
missus</i>, and twenty-five was the number of
races run in each day, the last of which was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">missus aerarius</i>, because in early times
the expense of it was defrayed by a collection
of money (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes</i>) made amongst the people.
The victor descended from his car at the conclusion
of the race, and ascended the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spina</i>,
where he received his reward (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bravium</i>, from
the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βραβεῖον</span>), which consisted in a
considerable sum of money.</p>

<p>The horse-racing
followed the same rules as the chariots.
The enthusiasm of the Romans for these
races exceeded all bounds. Lists of the
horses (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libella</i>), with their names and colours,
and those of the drivers, were handed about,
and heavy bets made upon each faction; and
sometimes the contests between two parties
broke out into open violence and bloody quarrels,

in the circus had nearly lost the Emperor
Justinian his crown.&mdash;II. <span id="Circus_ii" class="smcap">Ludus Trojae</span>,

the government of a prince; the citizens were
his subjects, and derived all their privileges,
civil as well as religious, from their nobles
and princes. The shadows of a council and
assembly were already in existence, but their
business was to obey. Upon the whole the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
notion of citizenship in the heroic ages only
existed so far as the condition of aliens or of
domestic slaves was its negative. The rise
of a dominant class gradually overthrew the
monarchies of ancient Greece. Of such a
class, the chief characteristics were good birth
and the hereditary transmission of privileges,
the possession of land, and the performance
of military service. To these characters the
names <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gamori</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γάμοροι</span>), <em>knights</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππεῖς</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eupatridae</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐπατρίδαι</span>), &amp;c. severally correspond.
Strictly speaking, these were the only
citizens; yet the lower class were quite distinct
from bondmen or slaves. It commonly
happened that the nobility occupied the fortified
towns, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</span>) lived in
the country and followed agricultural pursuits:
whenever the latter were gathered
within the walls, and became seamen or
handicraftsmen, the difference of ranks was
soon lost, and wealth made the only standard.
The quarrels of the nobility among themselves,
and the admixture of population arising from
immigrations, all tended to raise the lower
orders from their political subjection. It
must be remembered, too, that the possession
of domestic slaves, if it placed them in no
new relation to the governing body, at any
rate gave them leisure to attend to the higher
duties of a citizen, and thus served to increase
their political efficiency. During the convulsions
which followed the heroic ages, naturalisation
was readily granted to all who desired
it; as the value of citizenship increased, it
was, of course, more sparingly bestowed. The
ties of hospitality descended from the prince
to the state, and the friendly relations of the
Homeric heroes were exchanged for the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προξενίαι</span> of a later period. In political intercourse,
the importance of these last soon began
to be felt, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proxenus</i> at Athens, in
after times, obtained rights only inferior to
actual citizenship. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Hospitium">Hospitium</a>.</span>] The isopolite
relation existed, however, on a much
more extended scale. Sometimes particular
privileges were granted: as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιγαμία</span>, the
right of intermarriage; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγκτησις</span>, the right
of acquiring landed property; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτέλεια</span>, immunity
from taxation, especially <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτέλεια μετοικίου</span>,
from the tax imposed on resident aliens.
All these privileges were included under the
general term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰσοτέλεια</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰσοπολίτεια</span>, and the
class who obtained them were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰσοτελεῖς</span>.
They bore the same burthens with the citizens,
and could plead in the courts or transact
business with the people, without the intervention
of a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάτης</span>, or patron. Respecting
the division of the Athenian citizens into
tribes, phratriae and demes, see the articles
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribus">Tribus</a></span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Demus">Demus</a></span>.&mdash;If we would picture to
ourselves the true notion which the Greeks
embodied in the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">polis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόλις</span>), we must
lay aside all modern ideas respecting the
nature and object of a state. With us practically,
if not in theory, the <em>essential</em> object of
a state hardly embraces more than the protection
of life and property. The Greeks, on
the other hand, had the most vivid conception
of the state as a whole, every part of which
was to co-operate to some great end to which
all other duties were considered as subordinate.
Thus the aim of democracy was said
to be liberty; wealth, of oligarchy; and education,
of aristocracy. In all governments
the endeavour was to draw the social union
as close as possible, and it seems to have been
with this view that Aristotle laid down a
principle which answered well enough to the
accidental circumstances of the Grecian states,
that a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">polis</i> must be of a certain size. This
unity of purpose was nowhere so fully carried
out as in the government of Sparta. The
design of Spartan institutions was evidently
to unite the governing body among themselves
against the superior numbers of the subject
population. The division of lands, the syssitia,
the education of their youth, all tended
to this great object. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Helotes">Helotes</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Perioeci">Perioeci</a></span>.]
In legal rights all Spartans were equal: but
there were yet several gradations, which,
when once formed, retained their hold on the
aristocratic feelings of the people. First,
there was the dignity of the Heraclide families;
and, connected with this, a certain pre-eminence
of the Hyllean tribe. Another distinction
was that between the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homoioi</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅμοιοι</span>)
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypomeiones</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπομείονες</span>), which, in later
times, appears to have been considerable.
The latter term probably comprehended those
citizens who, from degeneracy of manners or
other causes, had undergone some kind of
civil degradation. To these the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homoioi</i> were
opposed, although it is not certain in what
the precise difference consisted. All the
Spartan citizens were included in the three
tribes, Hylleans, Dymanes or Dymanatae, and
Pamphilians, each of which was divided into
ten obes or phratries. The citizens of Sparta,
as of most oligarchical states, were landowners,
although this does not seem to have been
looked upon as an essential of citizenship.&mdash;(2)
<span class="smcap">Roman.</span> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Civitas</i> means the whole body
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cives</i>, or members, of any given state, and
the word is frequently used by the Roman
writers to express the rights of a Roman
citizen, as distinguished from those of other
persons not Roman citizens, as in the phrases,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dare civitatem</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donare civitate</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usurpare civitatem</i>.
Some members of a political community
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cives</i>) may have more political rights
than others; and this was the case at Rome
under the republic, in which we find a distinction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
made between two great classes of
Roman citizens, one that had, and another
that had not, a share in the sovereign power
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">optimo jure</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non optimo jure cives</i>). That
which peculiarly distinguished the higher
class, or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">optimo jure cives</i>, was the right
to vote in a tribe (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus suffragiorum</i>), and the
capacity of enjoying magistracy (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus honorum</i>).
The inferior class, or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non optimo
jure cives</i>, did not possess the above rights,
which the Romans called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus publicum</i>, but
they only had the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus privatum</i>, which comprehended
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus connubii</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus commercii</i>,
and those who had not these had no citizenship.&mdash;Under
the empire we find the free
persons who were within the political limits
of the Roman state divided into three great
classes. The same division probably existed
in an early period of the Roman state, and
certainly existed in the time of Cicero. These
classes were, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cives</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latini</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peregrini</i>.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Civis</i> is he who possesses the complete rights
of a Roman citizen. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peregrinus</i> was incapable
of exercising the rights of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commercium</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">connubium</i>, which were the characteristic
rights of a Roman citizen; but he had a
capacity for making all kinds of contracts
which were allowable by the jus gentium.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latinus</i> was in an intermediate state;
he had not the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">connubium</i>, and consequently
he had not the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patria potestas</i> nor rights of
agnatio; but he had the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commercium</i> or the
right of acquiring quiritarian ownership, and
he had also a capacity for all acts incident to
quiritarian ownership, as the power of making
a will in Roman form, and of becoming heres
under a will. The rights of a Roman citizen
were acquired in several ways, but most commonly
by a person being born of parents who
were Roman citizens. A slave might obtain
the civitas by manumission (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vindicta</i>), by the
census, and by a testamentum, if there was
no legal impediment; but it depended on
circumstances whether he became a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civis
Romanus</i>, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latinus</i>, or in the number of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peregrini dediticii</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Manumissio">Manumissio</a>.</span>] The
civitas could be conferred on a foreigner by a
lex, as in the case of Archias, who was a
civis of Heraclea, a civitas which had a foedus
with Rome, and who claimed the civitas Romana
under the provisions of a lex of Silvanus
and Carbo, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 89. By the provisions of
this lex, the person who chose to take the
benefit of it was required, within sixty days
after the passing of the lex, to signify to the
praetor his wish and consent to accept the
civitas (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">profiteri</i>). This lex was intended to
give the civitas, under certain limitations, to
foreigners who were citizens of foederate
states (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foederatis civitatibus adscripti</i>).
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Foederatae">Foederatae Civitates</a>.</span>] Thus the great
mass of the Italians obtained the civitas, and
the privileges of the former civitates foederatae
were extended to the provinces, first to
part of Gaul, and then to Sicily, under the
name of Jus Latii or Latinitas. This Latinitas
gave a man the right of acquiring the
Roman citizenship by having exercised a
magistratus in his own civitas; a privilege
which belonged to the foederatae civitates of
Italy before they obtained the Roman civitas.</p>

<p id="Clavus">CLĀVUS ANNĀLIS. In the early ages of
Rome, when letters were yet scarcely in use,
the Romans kept a reckoning of their years by
driving a nail (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clavus</i>), on the ides of each
September, into the side walls of the temple
of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, which ceremony
was performed by the consul or a dictator.</p>


<p id="Clavus_g">CLĀVUS GŬBERNĀCŬLI. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Navis">Navis</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Clavus_l">CLĀVUS LĀTUS, CLĀVUS ANGUSTUS.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clavus</i>, as an article of dress, seems to
have been a purple band worn upon the tunic
and toga, and was of two fashions, one broad
and the other narrow, denominated respectively
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clavus latus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clavus angustus</i>. The
former was a single broad band of purple,
extending perpendicularly from the neck
down the centre of the tunic; the latter probably
consisted of two narrow purple slips,
running parallel to each from the top to the
bottom of the tunic, one from each shoulder.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">latus clavus</i> was a distinctive badge of
the senatorian order; and hence it is used to
signify the senatorial dignity, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laticlavius</i>,
the person who enjoys it. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">angustus
clavus</i> was the decoration of the equestrian
order; but the right of wearing the latus
clavus was also given to the children of
equestrians, at least in the time of Augustus,
as a prelude to entering the senate-house.
This, however, was a matter of personal indulgence,
and was granted only to persons of
very ancient family and corresponding wealth,
and then by special favour of the emperor.
In such cases the latus clavus was assumed
with the toga virilis, and worn until the age
arrived at which the young equestrian was
admissible into the senate, when it was relinquished
and the angustus clavis resumed, if a
disinclination on his part, or any other circumstances,
prevented him from entering the
senate, as was the case with Ovid. But it
seems that the latus clavus could be again
resumed if the same individual subsequently
wished to become a senator, and hence a
fickle character is designated as one who is
always changing his clavus. The latus clavus
is said to have been introduced at Rome by
Tullus Hostilius, and to have been adopted by
him after his conquest of the Etruscans; nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
does it appear to have been confined to any
particular class during the earlier periods,
but to have been worn by all ranks promiscuously.
It was laid aside in public mourning.</p>


<p id="Clepsydra">CLEPSȲDRA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Horologium">Horologium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Cleruchi">CLĒRŪCHI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κληροῦχοι</span>), the name of
Athenian citizens who occupied conquered
lands; their possession was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cleruchia</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κληρουχία</span>). The Athenian Cleruchi differed
from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄποικοι</span> or ordinary colonists. The
only object of the earlier colonies was to
relieve surplus population, or to provide a
home for those whom internal quarrels had
exiled from their country. Most usually they
originated in private enterprise, and became
independent of, and lost their interest in, the
parent state. On the other hand, it was
essential to the very notion of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cleruchia</i> that
it should be a public enterprise, and should
always retain a connection more or less intimate
with Athens herself. The connection
with the parent state subsisted in all degrees.
Sometimes, as in the case of Lesbos, the
holders of land did not reside upon their
estates, but let them to the original inhabitants,
while themselves remained at Athens.
The condition of these cleruchi did not differ
from that of Athenian citizens who had estates
in Attica. All their political rights they
not only retained, but exercised as Athenians.
Another case was where the cleruchi resided
on their estates, and either with or without
the old inhabitants, formed a new community.
These still retained the rights of Athenian
citizens, which distance only precluded them
from exercising: they used the Athenian
courts; and if they or their children wished
to return to Athens, naturally and of course
they regained the exercise of their former
privileges. Sometimes, however, the connection
might gradually dissolve, and the cleruchi
sink into the condition of mere allies, or
separate wholly from the mother country.
It was to Pericles that Athens was chiefly
indebted for the extension and permanence
of her colonial settlements. His principal object
was to provide for the redundancies of
population, and raise the poorer citizens to
a fortune becoming the dignity of Athenian
citizens. It was of this class of persons that
the settlers were chiefly composed; the state
provided them with arms, and defrayed the
expenses of their journey. The Cleruchiae
were lost by the battle of Aegospotami, but
partially restored on the revival of Athenian
power.</p>


<p id="Cleteres">CLĒTĒRES or CLĒTORES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλητῆρες</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλῆτορες</span>), summoners, were at Athens not
official persons, but merely witnesses to the
prosecutor that he had served the defendant
with a notice of the action brought against him,
and the day upon which it would be requisite
for him to appear before the proper magistrate.</p>


<p id="Clibanarii">CLĪBĂNĀRĬI. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cataphracti">Cataphracti</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Cliens">CLĬENS is said to contain the same element
as the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cluere</i>, to “hear” or “obey,”
and may be accordingly compared with the
German word <em>höriger</em>, “a dependant,” from
<em>hören</em>, “to hear.” In the earliest times of
the Roman state we find a class of persons
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clientes</i>, who must not be confounded
with the plebeians, from whom they were
distinct. The clients were not slaves: they
had property of their own and freedom, and
appear to have had votes in the comitia centuriata,
but they did not possess the full rights
of Roman citizens; and the peculiarity of
their condition consisted in every client being
in a state of dependence upon or subjection to
some patrician, who was called his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patronus</i>,
and to whom he owed certain rights and
duties. The patronus, on the other hand,
likewise incurred certain obligations towards
his client. This relationship between patronus
and cliens was expressed by the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clientela</i>,
which also expressed the whole body of a
man’s clients. The relative rights and duties
of the patrons and the clients were, according
to Dionysius, as follows:&mdash;The patron was the
legal adviser of the cliens; he was the client’s
guardian and protector, as he was the guardian
and protector of his own children; he
maintained the client’s suit when he was
wronged, and defended him when another
complained of being wronged by him: in a
word, the patron was the guardian of the
client’s interests, both private and public.
The client contributed to the marriage portion
of the patron’s daughter, if the patron
was poor; and to his ransom, or that of his
children, if they were taken prisoners; he
paid the costs and damages of a suit which
the patron lost, and of any penalty in which
he was condemned; he bore a part of the
patron’s expenses incurred by his discharging
public duties, or filling the honourable places
in the state. Neither party could accuse the
other, or bear testimony against the other, or
give his vote against the other. This relationship
between patron and client subsisted
for many generations, and resembled in all
respects the relationship by blood. The
relation of a master to his liberated slave
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libertus</i>) was expressed by the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patronus</i>,
and the libertus was the cliens of his
patronus. Distinguished Romans were also
the protectors of states and cities, which were
in a certain relation of subjection or dependence
to Rome. In the time of Cicero we also
find <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patronus</i> in the sense of adviser, advocate,
or defender, opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cliens</i> in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
sense of the person defended or the consultor,&mdash;a
use of the word which must be referred
to the original character of the patronus.</p>

<p id="Clipeus">CLĬPĔUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσπίς</span>), the large shield worn
by the Greeks and Romans, which was originally
of a circular form, and is said to have
been first used by Proetus and Acrisius of
Argos, and therefore is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clipeus Argolicus</i>,
and likened to the sun. But the clipeus
is often represented in Roman sculpture of an
oblong oval, which makes the distinction between
the common buckler and that of Argos.
The outer rim was termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄντυξ</span> by the Greeks;
and in the centre was a projection called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀμφάλος</span> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">umbo</i>, which served as a sort of
weapon by itself, or caused the missiles of the
enemy to glance off from the shield. In the
Homeric times, the Greeks merely used a
leather strap (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελαμών</span>) to support the shield,
but subsequently a handle (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄχανον</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀχάνη</span>).
The usual form of the clipeus is exhibited in
the figure of the Greek warrior on <a href="#ill041">p. 41</a>.
When the census was instituted by Servius
Tullius at Rome, the first class only used the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clipeus</i>, and the second were armed with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutum</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Scutum">Scutum</a></span>]; but after the Roman soldiery
received pay, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clipeus</i> was discontinued
altogether for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutum</i>.</p>


<p id="Clitellae">CLĪTELLAE, a pair of panniers, and therefore

<p id="Cloaca">CLŎĀCA, a sewer, a drain. Rome was
intersected by numerous sewers, some of
which were of an immense size: the most
celebrated of them was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cloaca maxima</i>,
the construction of which is ascribed to Tarquinius
Priscus. It was formed by three
tiers of arches, one within the other, the
innermost of which is a semicircular vault of
14 feet in diameter. The manner of its construction
is shown in the preceding cut.
Under the republic, the administration of the
sewers was entrusted to the censors: but
under the empire, particular officers were
appointed for that purpose, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cloacarum
curatores</i>, who employed condemned criminals
in cleansing and repairing them.</p>

<p id="Coactor">CŎACTOR, the name of collectors of various
sorts, <em>e.g.</em> the servants of the publicani, or
farmers of the public taxes, who collected the
revenues for them, and those who collected
the money from the purchasers of things sold
at a public auction. Horace informs us that
his father was a coactor of this kind. Moreover,
the servants of the money-changers were so
called, from collecting their debts for them.

<p id="Cochlea">CŎCHLĔA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοχλίας</span>), which properly means
a snail, was also used to signify other things
of a spiral form. (1) A screw, used in
working clothes-presses, and oil and wine
presses.&mdash;(2) A spiral pump for raising
water, invented by Archimedes, from whom
it has ever since been called the Archimedean

<p id="Cochlear">COCHLĔAR. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοχλιάριον</span>), a kind of spoon,
which appears to have terminated with a
point at one end, and at the other was broad
and hollow like our own spoons. The pointed
end was used for drawing snails (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cochleae</i>)
out of their shells, and eating them, whence
it derived its name; and the broader part
for eating eggs, &amp;c. Cochlear was also the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
name given to a small measure like our

<p id="Codex">CŌDEX, identical with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caudex</i>, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Claudius</i>

and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coda</i>, originally signified the trunk or
stem of a tree. The name codex was especially
applied to wooden tablets bound together
and lined with a coat of wax, for the purpose
of writing upon them, and when, at a later
age, parchment or paper, or other materials
were substituted for wood, and put together
in the shape of a book, the name of codex was
still given to them. In the time of Cicero
we find it also applied to the tablet on which
a bill was written. At a still later period,
during the time of the emperors, the word
was used to express any collection of laws or
constitutions of the emperors, whether made
by private individuals or by public authority,

<p id="Coena">COENA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεῖπνον</span>), the principal meal of the
Greeks and Romans, dinner. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>
Three names of meals occur in the Iliad and
Odyssey&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ariston</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄριστον</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deipnon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεῖπνον</span>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dorpon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόρπον</span>). The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ariston</i> uniformly
means the early, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dorpon</i> does the
late meal; but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deipnon</i>, on the other hand,
is used for either, apparently without any
reference to time. In the Homeric age it
appears to have been usual to sit during mealtimes.
Beef, mutton, and goat’s flesh were
the ordinary meats, usually eaten roasted.
Cheese, flour, and occasionally fruits, also
formed part of the Homeric meals. Bread,
brought on in baskets, and salt (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἃλς</span>, to which
Homer gives the epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεῖος</span>), are mentioned.
The Greeks of a later age usually partook of
three meals, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acratisma</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκράτισμα</span>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ariston</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deipnon</i>. The last, which corresponds
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dorpon</i> of the Homeric poems,
was the evening meal or dinner; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ariston</i>
was the luncheon; and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acratisma</i>, which
answers to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ariston</i> of Homer, was the
early meal or breakfast. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acratisma</i> was
taken immediately after rising in the morning.
It usually consisted of bread, dipped in unmixed
wine (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκρατος</span>), whence it derived its
name. Next followed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ariston</i> or luncheon;
but the time at which it was taken is uncertain.
It is frequently mentioned in Xenophon’s
Anabasis, and appears to have been
taken at different times, as would naturally
be the case with soldiers in active service.
We may conclude from many circumstances
that this meal was taken about the middle of
the day, and that it answered to the Roman
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prandium</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ariston</i> was usually a simple
meal, but of course varied according to the
habits of individuals. The principal meal
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deipnon</i>. It was usually taken
rather late in the day, frequently not before
sunset. The Athenians were a social people,
and were very fond of dining in company.
Entertainments were usually given, both in
the heroic ages and later times, when sacrifices
were offered to the gods, either on public
or private occasions; and also on the anniversary
of the birthdays of members of the
family, or of illustrious persons, whether
living or dead. When young men wished to
dine together they frequently contributed
each a certain sum of money, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">symbole</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συμβολή</span>), or brought their own provisions
with them. When the first plan was adopted,
they were said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ συμβολῶν δειπνεῖν</span>, and one
individual was usually entrusted with the
money to procure the provisions, and make
all the necessary preparations. This kind of
entertainment, in which each guest contributed
to the expense, is mentioned in Homer
under the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔρανος</span>. An entertainment
in which each person brought his own provisions
with him, or at least contributed something
to the general stock, was called a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεῖπνον
ἀπὸ σπυρίδος</span>, because the provisions were
brought in baskets.&mdash;The most usual kind of
entertainments, however, were those in which
a person invited his friends to his own house.
It was expected that they should come dressed
with more than ordinary care, and also have
bathed shortly before. As soon as the guests
arrived at the house of their host, their shoes
or sandals were taken off by the slaves and
their feet washed. After their feet had been
washed, the guests reclined on the couches.
It has already been remarked that Homer
never describes persons as reclining, but
always as sitting at their meals; but at what
time the change was introduced is uncertain.
The Dorians of Crete always sat; but the
other Greeks reclined. The Greek women
and children, however, like the Roman, continued
to sit at their meals. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Accubatio">Accubatio</a>.</span>]
It was usual for only two persons to recline
on each couch. After the guests had placed
themselves on the couches, the slaves brought
in water to wash their hands. The dinner
was then served up; whence we read of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὰς
τραπέζας εἰσφέρειν</span>, by which expression we
are to understand not merely the dishes, but
the tables themselves, which were small
enough to be moved with ease. In eating,
the Greeks had no knives or forks, but made
use of their fingers only, except in eating
soups or other liquids, which they partook of
by means of a spoon, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυστίλη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μύστρον</span>,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μύστρος</span>. It would exceed the limits of
this work to give an account of the different
dishes which were introduced at a Greek
dinner, though their number is far below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
those which were usually partaken of at a
Roman entertainment. The most common
food among the Greeks was the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάζα</span>, a kind
of frumenty or soft cake, which was prepared
in different ways. Wheaten or barley bread
was the second most usual species of food; it
was sometimes made at home, but more
usually bought at the market of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρτοπῶλαι</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρτοπώλιδες</span>. The vegetables ordinarily
eaten were mallows (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαλάχη</span>), lettuces (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρίδαξ</span>),
cabbages (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥάφανοι</span>), beans (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύαμοι</span>), lentils
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φακαῖ</span>), &amp;c. Pork was the most favourite
animal food, as was the case among the Romans.
It is a curious fact, which Plato has
remarked, that we never read in Homer of
the heroes partaking of fish. In later times,
however, fish was one of the most favourite
foods of the Greeks. A dinner given by an
opulent Athenian usually consisted of two
courses, called respectively <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρῶται τράπεζαι</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεύτεραι τράπεζαι</span>. The first course embraced
the whole of what we consider the
dinner, namely, fish, poultry, meat, &amp;c.; the
second, which corresponds to our dessert and
the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bellaria</i>, consisted of different
kinds of fruit, sweetmeats, confections, &amp;c.
When the first course was finished, the tables
were taken away, and water was given to the
guests for the purpose of washing their hands.
Crowns made of garlands of flowers were also
then given to them, as well as various kinds
of perfumes. Wine was not drunk till the
first course was finished; but as soon as the
guests had washed their hands, unmixed wine
was introduced in a large goblet, of which
each drank a little, after pouring out a small
quantity as a libation. This libation was
said to be made to the “good spirit”
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθοῦ δαίμονος</span>), and was usually accompanied
with the singing of the paean and the
playing of flutes. After this libation mixed
wine was brought in, and with their first cup
the guests drank to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διὸς Σωτῆρος</span>. With the
libations the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deipnon</i> closed; and at the introduction
of the dessert (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεύτεραι τράπεζαι</span>)
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πότος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συμπόσιον</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῶμος</span> commenced, of
which an account is given under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Symposium">Symposium</a></span>.&mdash;(2)
<span class="smcap">Roman.</span> As the Roman meals are not
always clearly distinguished, it will be convenient
to treat of all under the most important
one; and we shall confine ourselves to the
description of the ordinary life of the middle
ranks of society in the Augustan age, noticing
incidentally the most remarkable deviations.
The meal with which the Roman sometimes
began the day was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jentaculum</i>, which was
chiefly taken by children, or sick persons, or
the luxurious. An irregular meal (if we may
so express it) was not likely to have any very
regular time: two epigrams of Martial, however,
seem to fix the hour at about three or
four o’clock in the morning. Bread formed
the substantial part of this early breakfast, to
which cheese, or dried fruit, as dates and
raisins, were sometimes added. Next followed
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prandium</i> or luncheon, with persons of
simple habits a frugal meal, usually taken
about twelve or one o’clock. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coena</i>, or
principal meal of the day, corresponding to
our “dinner,” was usually taken about three
o’clock in the time of Cicero and Augustus,
though we read of some persons not dining
till near sunset. A Roman dinner at the
house of a wealthy man usually consisted of
three courses. The first was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promulsis</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">antecoena</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gustatio</i>, and was made up of
all sorts of stimulants to the appetite. Eggs
also were so indispensable to the first course
that they almost gave a name to it (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab ovo
usque ad mala</i>). The frugality of Martial
only allowed of lettuce and Sicenian olives;
indeed he himself tells us that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promulsis</i>
was a refinement of modern luxury. It would
far exceed our limits to mention all the dishes
which formed the second course of a Roman
dinner. Of birds, the Guinea hen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Afra avis</i>),
the pheasant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phasiana</i>, so called from Phasis,
a river of Colchis), and the thrush, were
most in repute; the liver of a capon steeped
in milk, and beccaficos (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ficedulae</i>) dressed
with pepper, were held a delicacy. The peacock,
according to Macrobius, was first introduced
by Hortensius the orator, at an inaugural
supper, and acquired such repute among
the Roman gourmands as to be commonly sold
for fifty denarii. Other birds are mentioned,
as the duck (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anas</i>), especially its head and
breast; the woodcock (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">attagen</i>), the turtle,
and flamingo (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phoenicopterus</i>), the tongue of
which, Martial tells us, particularly commended
itself to the delicate palate. Of fish,
the variety was perhaps still greater; the
charr (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scarus</i>), the turbot (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rhombus</i>), the sturgeon
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acipenser</i>), the mullet (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mullus</i>), were
highly prized, and dressed in the most various
fashions. Of solid meat, pork seems to have
been the favourite dish, especially sucking
pig. Boar’s flesh and venison were also in
high repute: the former is described by
Juvenal as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animal propter convivia natum</i>.
Condiments were added to most of these
dishes: such were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">muria</i>, a kind of
pickle made from the tunny fish; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">garum
sociorum</i>, made from the intestines of the
mackerel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scomber</i>), so called because brought
from abroad; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alec</i>, a sort of brine; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">faex</i>, the
sediment of wine, &amp;c. Several kinds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fungi</i>
are mentioned, truffles (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">boleti</i>), mushrooms
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuberes</i>), which either made dishes by themselves,
or formed the garniture for larger
dishes. It must not be supposed that the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">artistes</i> of imperial Rome were at all behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
ourselves in the preparation and arrangements
of the table. In a large household, the functionaries
to whom this important duty was
entrusted were four, the butler (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promus</i>), the
cook (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">archimagirus</i>), the arranger of the dishes
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">structor</i>), and the carver (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carptor</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scissor</i>).
Carving was taught as an art, and performed
to the sound of music, with appropriate gesticulations.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the supper of Petronius, a large round
tray (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferculum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repositorium</i>) is brought in,
with the signs of the zodiac figured all round
it, upon each of which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">artiste</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">structor</i>)
had placed some appropriate viand, a goose
on Aquarius, a pair of scales with tarts (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriblitae</i>)
and cheesecakes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placentae</i>) in each
scale on Libra, &amp;c. In the middle was
placed a hive supported by delicate herbage.
Presently four slaves come forward dancing
to the sound of music, and take away the
upper part of the dish; beneath appear all
kinds of dressed meats; a hare with wings to
imitate Pegasus, in the middle; and four
figures of Marsyas at the corners, pouring
hot sauce (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">garum piperatum</i>) over the fish,
that were swimming in the Euripus below. So
entirely had the Romans lost all shame of
luxury, since the days when Cincius, in supporting
the Fannian law, charged his own
age with the enormity of introducing the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porcus Trojanus</i>, a sort of pudding stuffed
with the flesh of other animals.&mdash;The third
course was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bellaria</i> or dessert, to which
Horace alludes when he says of Tigellius <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab
ovo usque ad mala citaret</i>; it consisted of
fruits (which the Romans usually ate uncooked),
such as almonds (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amygdalae</i>), dried
grapes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uvae passae</i>), dates (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palmulae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caryotae</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dactyli</i>); of sweetmeats and confections,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edulia mellita</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dulciaria</i>, such as cheesecakes
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cupediae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crustula</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liba</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placentae</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">artolagani</i>), almond cakes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coptae</i>), tarts
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriblitae</i>), whence the maker of them was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pistor dulciarius</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placentarius</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libarius</i>,
&amp;c. We will now suppose the table
spread and the guests assembled, each with
his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mappa</i> or napkin, and in his dinner dress,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coenatoria</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubitoria</i>, usually of a
bright colour, and variegated with flowers.
First they took off their shoes, for fear of
soiling the couch, which was often inlaid
with ivory or tortoise-shell, and covered with
cloth of gold. Next they lay down to eat,
the head resting on the left elbow and supported
by cushions. There were usually, but
not always, three on the same couch, the
middle place being esteemed the most honourable.
Around the tables stood the servants
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ministri</i>) clothed in a tunic, and girt with
napkins; some removed the dishes and wiped
the tables with a rough cloth, others gave the
guests water for their hands, or cooled the
room with fans. Here stood an eastern youth
behind his master’s couch, ready to answer
the noise of the fingers, while others bore a
large platter of different kinds of meat to the
guests. Dinner was set out in a room called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coenatio</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diaeta</i> (which two words perhaps
conveyed to a Roman ear nearly the same
distinction as our dining-room and parlour).
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coenatio</i>, in rich men’s houses, was fitted
up with great magnificence. Suetonius mentions
a supper-room in the golden palace of
Nero, constructed like a theatre, with shifting
scenes to change with every course. In the
midst of the coenatio were set three couches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triclinia</i>), answering in shape to the square,
as the long semicircular couches (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sigmata</i>)
did to the oval tables. An account of the
disposition of the couches, and of the place
which each guest occupied, is given in the
article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Triclinium">Triclinium</a></span>.</p>

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognati</i>. The foundation of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognatio</i> is a

at Athens, who had the management of
all financial matters in the time of the kings.
Cleisthenes deprived them of the charge of
the finances, which he transferred to the
Apodectae. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Apodectae">Apodectae</a>.</span>] From this time
the Colacretae had only to provide for the
meals in the Prytaneium, and subsequently to
pay the fees to the dicasts, when the practice
of paying the dicasts was introduced by
Pericles.</p>


<p id="Collegium">COLLĒGĬUM. The persons who formed
a collegium were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">collegae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sodales</i>.
The word collegium properly expressed the
notion of several persons being united in any
office or for any common purpose; it afterwards
came to signify a body of persons, and
the union which bound them together. The
collegium was the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑταιρία</span> of the Greeks. The
legal notion of a collegium was as follows:&mdash;A
collegium or corpus, as it was also called,
must consist of three persons at least. Persons
who legally formed such an association
were said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus habere</i>, which is equivalent
to our phrase of being incorporated; and in
later times they were said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corporati</i>,
and the body was called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corporatio</i>. Associations
of individuals, who were entitled to
have a corpus, could hold property in common.
Such a body, which was sometimes also called
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">universitas</i>, was a legal unity. That which
was due to the body, was not due to the individuals
of it; and that which the body owed,
was not the debt of the individuals. The
common property of the body was liable to be
seized and sold for the debts of the body. It
does not appear how collegia were formed,
except that some were specially established by
legal authority. Other collegia were probably
formed by voluntary associations of individuals
under the provisions of some general
legal authority, such as those of the publicani.
Some of these corporate bodies resembled
our companies or guilds; such were the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fabrorum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pistorum</i>, &amp;c. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">collegia</i>. Others
were of a religious character; such as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontificum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">augurum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fratrum arvalium collegia</i>.
Others were bodies concerned about
government and administration; as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribunorum
plebis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quaestorum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decurionum collegia</i>. According
to the definition of a collegium, the
consuls being only two in number were not
a collegium, though each was called collega
with respect to the other, and their union in
office was called collegium. When a new
member was taken into a collegium, he was
said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">co-optari</i>, and the old members were said
with respect to him, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">recipere in collegium</i>.
The mode of filling up vacancies would vary
in different collegia. The statement of their
rules belongs to the several heads of <span class="smcap"><a href="#Augur">Augur</a></span>,
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pontifex">Pontifex</a></span>, &amp;c.</p>


<p id="Colonia">CŎLŌNĬA, a colony, contains the same
element as the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colere</i>, “to cultivate,” and
as the word colonus, which probably originally
signified a “tiller of the earth.” (1)
<span class="smcap">Greek.</span> The usual Greek words for a colony
are <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποικία</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κληρουχία</span>. The latter word,
which signified a division of conquered lands
among Athenian citizens, and which corresponds
in some respects to the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colonia</i>,
is explained in the article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Cleruchi">Cleruchi</a></span>. The
earlier Greek colonies, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποικίαι</span>, were
usually composed of mere bands of adventurers,
who left their native country, with their
families and property, to seek a new home for
themselves. Some of the colonies, which
arose in consequence of foreign invasion or
civil wars, were undertaken without any
formal consent from the rest of the community;
but usually a colony was sent out with the
approbation of the mother country, and under
the management of a leader (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰκιστής</span>) appointed
by it. But whatever may have been
the origin of the colony, it was always considered
in a political point of view independent
of the mother country, called by the
Greeks <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metropolis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μητρόπολις</span>), the “mother-city,”
and entirely emancipated from its control.
At the same time, though a colony was
in no political subjection to its parent state,
it was united to it by the ties of filial affection;
and, according to the generally received
opinions of the Greeks, its duties to the parent
state corresponded to those of a daughter to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
her mother. Hence, in all matters of common
interest, the colony gave precedence to the
mother state; and the founder of the colony
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰκιστής</span>), who might be considered as the
representative of the parent state, was usually
worshipped, after his death, as a hero.
Also, when the colony became in its turn a
parent, it usually sought a leader for the
colony which it intended to found from the
original mother country; and the same feeling
of respect was manifested by embassies
which were sent to honour the principal
festivals of the parent state, and also by bestowing
places of honour and other marks of
respect upon the ambassadors and other members
of the parent state, when they visited
the colony at festivals and on similar occasions.
The colonists also worshipped in their new
settlement the same deities as they had been
accustomed to honour in their native country:
the sacred fire, which was constantly kept
burning on their public hearth, was taken
from the Prytaneium of the parent city; and
sometimes the priests also were brought from
the mother state. In the same spirit, it was
considered a violation of sacred ties for a
mother country and a colony to make war
upon one another. The preceding account of
the relations between the Greek colonies and
the mother country is supported by the history
which Thucydides gives us of the quarrel
between Corcyra and Corinth. Corcyra was
a colony of Corinth, and Epidamnus a
colony of Corcyra; but the leader (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰκιστής</span>)
of the colony of Epidamnus was a Corinthian
who was invited from the metropolis Corinth.
In course of time, in consequence of civil dissensions,
and attacks from the neighbouring
barbarians, the Epidamnians apply for aid to
Corcyra, but their request is rejected. They
next apply to the Corinthians, who took
Epidamnus under their protection, thinking,
says Thucydides, that the colony was no less
theirs than the Corinthians’: and also induced
to do so through hatred of the Corcyraeans,
because they neglected them though
they were colonists; for they did not give to
the Corinthians the customary honours and
deference in the public solemnities and sacrifices,
which the other colonies were wont to
pay to the mother country. The Corcyraeans,
who had become very powerful by sea, took
offence at the Corinthians receiving Epidamnus
under their protection, and the result
was a war between Corcyra and Corinth.
The Corcyraeans sent ambassadors to Athens
to ask assistance; and in reply to the objection
that they were a colony of Corinth, they
said, “that every colony, as long as it is
treated kindly, respects the mother country:
but when it is injured, is alienated from it;
for colonists are not sent out as subjects, but
that they may have equal rights with those
that remain at home.” It is true that ambitious
states, such as Athens, sometimes
claimed dominion over other states on the
ground of relationship; but as a general
rule, colonies may be regarded as independent
states, attached to their metropolis by ties of
sympathy and common descent, but no further.
The case of Potidaea, to which the
Corinthians sent annually the chief magistrates
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημιουργοί</span>), appears to have been an
exception to the general rule.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span>
A kind of colonisation seems to have existed
among the oldest Italian nations, who, on
certain occasions, sent out their superfluous
male population, with arms in their hands,
to seek for a new home. But these were
apparently mere bands of adventurers, and
such colonies rather resembled the old Greek
colonies, than those by which Rome extended
her dominion and her name. Colonies were
established by the Romans as far back as the
annals or traditions of the city extend, and
the practice was continued, without intermission,
during the republic and under
the empire. Colonies were intended to keep
in check a conquered people, and also to
repress hostile incursions; and their chief
object was originally the extension and preservation
of the Roman dominion in Italy.
Cicero calls the old Italian colonies the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propugnacula
imperii</i>. Another object was to
increase the power of Rome by increasing the
population. Sometimes the immediate object
of a colony was to carry off a number of turbulent
and discontented persons. Colonies
were also established for the purpose of providing
for veteran soldiers, a practice which
was begun by Sulla, and continued under the
emperors; these coloniae were called militares.
The old Roman colonies were in the
nature of garrisons planted in conquered
towns, and the colonists had a portion of the
conquered territory (usually a third part)
assigned to them. The inhabitants retained
the rest of their lands, and lived together
with the new settlers, who alone composed
the proper colony. The conquered people
must at first have been quite a distinct class
from, and inferior to, the colonists. No
colonia was established without a lex, plebiscitum,
or senatusconsultum; a fact which
shows that a Roman colony was never a mere
body of adventurers, but had a regular organisation
by the parent state. When a law
was passed for founding a colony, persons
were appointed to superintend its formation
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coloniam deducere</i>). These persons varied
in number, but three was a common number
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triumviri ad colonos deducendos</i>). We also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
read of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duumviri</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinqueviri</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vigintiviri</i> for
the same purpose. The law fixed the quantity
of land that was to be distributed, and
how much was to be assigned to each person.
No Roman could be sent out as a colonist
without his free consent, and when the colony
was not an inviting one, it was difficult to
fill up the number of volunteers. The colonia
proceeded to its place of destination in the
form of an army (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub vexillo</i>), which is indicated
on the coins of some coloniae. An urbs,
if one did not already exist, was a necessary
part of a new colony, and its limits were
marked out by a plough, which is also indicated
on ancient coins. The colonia had also a territory,
which, whether marked out by the
plough or not, was at least marked out by
metes and bounds. Thus the urbs and territory
of the colonia respectively corresponded
to the urbs Roma and its territory. Religious
ceremonies always accompanied the foundation
of the colony, and the anniversary was
afterwards observed. It is stated that a
colony could not be sent out to the same
place to which a colony had already been sent
in due form (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicato deducta</i>). This merely
means, that so long as the colony maintained
its existence, there could be no new colony in
the same place; a doctrine that would hardly
need proof, for a new colony implied a new
assignment of lands; but new settlers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novi
adscripti</i>) might be sent to occupy colonial
lands not already assigned. Indeed it was
not unusual for a colony to receive additions,
and a colony might be re-established,
if it seemed necessary, from any cause. The
commissioners appointed to conduct the
colony had apparently a profitable office, and
the establishment of a new settlement gave
employment to numerous functionaries, among
whom Cicero enumerates&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apparitores</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scribae</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">librarii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praecones</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">architecti</i>. The
foundation of a colony might then, in many
cases, not only be a mere party measure, carried
for the purpose of gaining popularity,
but it would give those in power an opportunity
of providing places for many of their
friends.&mdash;The colonies founded by the Romans
were divided into two great classes of colonies
of Roman citizens and Latin colonies;
names which had no reference to the persons
who formed the colonies, but merely indicated
their political rights with respect to Rome as
members of the colony. The members of a
Roman colony (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colonia civium Romanorum</i>)
preserved all the rights of Roman citizens.
The members of a Latin colony (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colonia
Latina</i>) ceased to have the full rights of
Roman citizens. Probably some of the old
Latin colonies were established by the Romans
in conjunction with other Latin states. After
the conquest of Latium, the Romans established
colonies, called Latin colonies, in
various parts of Italy. Roman citizens, who
chose to join such colonies, gave up their
civic rights for the more solid advantage of a
grant of land, and became <span class="smcap">Latini</span>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Civitas">Civitas</a>.</span>]
Such colonies were subject to, and part of, the
Roman state; but they did not possess the
Roman franchise, and had no political bond
among themselves.&mdash;The lex Julia, passed
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 90, gave the Roman franchise to the
members of the Latin colonies and the Socii;
and such Latin colonies and states of the Socii
were then called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">municipia</i>, and became complete
members of the Roman state. Thus
there was then really no difference between
these municipia and the Roman coloniae, except
in their historical origin: the members
of both were Roman citizens, and the Roman
law prevailed in both.&mdash;In the colonies, as at
Rome, the popular assembly had originally
the sovereign power; they chose the magistrates,
and could even make laws. When the
popular assemblies became a mere form in
Rome, and the elections were transferred by
Tiberius to the senate, the same thing happened
in the colonies, whose senates then
possessed whatever power had once belonged
to the community. The common name of this
senate was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordo decurionum</i>; in later times,
simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordo</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curia</i>; the members of it
were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decuriones</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiales</i>. Thus, in the
later ages, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curia</i> is opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus</i>, the
former being the senate of a colony, and the
latter the senate of Rome. But the terms
senatus and senator were also applied to the
senate and members of the senate of a colony.
After the decline of the popular assemblies,
the senate had the whole internal administration
of a city, conjointly with the magistratus;
but only a decurio could be a magistratus,
and the choice was made by the decuriones.
The highest magistratus of a colonia were the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duumviri</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quattuorviri</i>, so called, as the
members might vary, whose functions may
be compared with those of the consulate at
Rome before the establishment of the praetorship.
The name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duumviri</i> seems to have
been the most common. Their principal
duties were the administration of justice, and
accordingly we find on inscriptions “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duumviri
J. D.” (<em>juri dicundo</em>), “Quattuorviri
J. D.</span>” The name consul also occurs in inscriptions
to denote this chief magistracy;
and even dictator and praetor occur under the
empire and under the republic. The office of
the duumviri lasted a year.&mdash;In some Italian
towns there was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectus juri dicundo</i>;
he was in the place of, and not co-existent
with, the duumviri. The duumviri were, as
we have seen, originally chosen by the people;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
but the praefectus was appointed annually in
Rome, and sent to the town called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefectura</i>,
which might be either a municipium
or a colonia, for it was only in the matter of
the praefectus that a town called a praefectura
differed from other Italian towns. Arpinum
is called both a municipium and a
praefectura; and Cicero, a native of this
place, obtained the highest honours that
Rome could confer.&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censor</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curator</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinquennalis</i>, all which names denote the
same functionary, was also a municipal magistrate,
and corresponded to the censor at
Rome, and in some cases, perhaps, to the
quaestor also. Censors are mentioned in
Livy as magistrates of the twelve Latin colonies.
The quinquennales were sometimes
duumviri, sometimes quattuorviri; but they
are always carefully distinguished from the
duumviri and quattuorviri J. D.; and their
functions were those of censors. They held
their office for one year, and during the four
intermediate years the functions were not
exercised. The office of censor or quinquennalis
was higher in rank than that of the
duumviri J. D., and it could only be filled by
those who had discharged the other offices of
the municipality.</p>


<p id="Colossus">CŎLOSSUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κολοσσός</span>) is used both by
the Greeks and Romans to signify a statue
larger than life; but as such statues were
very common, the word was more frequently
applied to designate figures of gigantic dimensions.
Such figures were first executed
in Egypt, and were afterwards made by the
Greeks and Romans. Among the colossal
statues of Greece, the most celebrated was
the bronze <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colossus</i> at Rhodes, dedicated to
the sun, the height of which was about 90 feet.</p>

<p id="Colum">CŌLUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠθμός</span>), a strainer or colander,
was used for straining wine, milk, olive-oil,
and other liquids. Those that were used as
articles of luxury for straining wine were
frequently made of some metal, such as bronze
or silver. Occasionally a piece of linen cloth
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάκκος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saccus</i>) was placed over the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρύγοιπος</span>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colum</i>, and the wine (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σακκίας</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saccatus</i>)
filtered through. The use of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saccus</i> was
considered objectionable for all delicate wines,
since it was believed to injure, if not entirely
to destroy their flavour, and in every instance
to diminish the strength of the liquor. For
this reason it was employed by the dissipated
in order that they might be able to swallow a
greater quantity without becoming intoxicated.
The double purpose of cooling and
weakening was effectually accomplished by
placing ice or snow in the filter, which under
such circumstances became a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colum nivarium</i>,

</div>

<p id="Columna">CŎLUMNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κίων</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στύλος</span>), a pillar or column.
The use of the trunks of trees placed upright
for supporting buildings, unquestionably
led to the adoption of similar supports
wrought in stone. As the tree required to
be based upon a flat square stone, and to have
a stone or tile of similar form fixed on its
summit to preserve it from decay, so the column
was made with a square base, and was
covered with an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abacus</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Abacus">Abacus</a>.</span>] Hence
the principal parts of which every column
consists are three, the base (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basis</i>), the shaft
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scapus</i>), and the capital (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capitulum</i>). In the
Doric, which is the oldest style of Greek
architecture, we must consider all the columns
in the same row as having one common
base (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">podium</i>), whereas in the Ionic and Corinthian
each column has a separate base,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spira</i>. The capitals of these two latter
orders show, on comparison with the Doric,
a much richer style of ornament; and the
character of lightness and elegance is further
obtained in them by their more slender shaft,
its height being much greater in proportion
to its thickness. Of all these circumstances
some idea may be formed by the inspection of
the three accompanying specimens of pillars.
The first on the left hand is Doric, the second
Ionic, and the third Corinthian. In all the
orders the shaft tapers from the bottom towards
the top. The shaft was, however,
made with a slight swelling in the middle,
which was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">entasis</i>. It was, moreover,
almost universally channelled or fluted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Columns were used in the interior of buildings,
to sustain the beams which supported
the ceiling. Rows of columns were often employed
within a building, to enclose a space
open to the sky. Beams supporting ceilings
passed from above the columns to the adjoining
walls, so as to form covered passages or
ambulatories (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στοαί</span>). Such a circuit of columns
was called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peristyle</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίστυλον</span>), and
the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atrium</i> was built upon this plan.
The largest and most splendid temples enclosed
an open space like an atrium, which
was accomplished by placing one peristyle
upon another. In such cases, the lower rows
of columns being Doric, the upper were sometimes
Ionic or Corinthian, the lighter being
properly based upon the heavier. A temple
so constructed was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hypaethral</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕπαιθρος</span>).
But it was on the exterior of public
buildings, and especially of temples, that columns
were displayed in the most beautiful
combinations, either surrounding the building
entirely, or arranged in porticoes on one or
more of its fronts. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Templum">Templum</a>.</span>] Their original
and proper use was, of course, to support
the roof of the building; and, amidst all
the elaborations of architectural design, this
object was still kept in view. On the summit
of the row of columns rests the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">architrave</i>,
i.e. <em>chief beam</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστύλιον</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epistylium</i>): above
this is the <em>frieze</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωοφόρος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωφόρος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">zophorus</i>),
in which the most ancient order, namely the
Doric, shows, in its triglyphs, what were
originally the ends of the cross-beams: in
the other orders these ends are generally concealed,
and the frieze forms a flat surface,
which is frequently ornamented by figures in
relief, whence its Greek name. Above the
frieze projects the cornice (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορωνίς</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coronis</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona</i>), forming a handsome finish to the
entablature (for so these three members taken
together are called), and also, on the sides of
the building, serving to unite the ends of the
rafters of the roof. The triangular gable-end
of the roof, above the entablature, is called
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pediment</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fastigium">Fastigium</a>.</span>]&mdash;Columns in
long rows were used in aquaeducts, and single
pillars were fixed in harbours for mooring
ships.&mdash;Single columns were also erected to
commemorate persons or events. Among
these, some of the most remarkable were the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">columnae rostratae</i>, called by that name because
three ship-beaks proceeded from each
side of them, designed to record successful
engagements at sea. The most important
and celebrated of those which yet remain, is
one erected in honour of the consul C. Duillius,
on occasion of his victory over the Carthaginian
fleet, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 261. Columns were also
employed to commemorate the dead. The
column on the right hand in the last woodcut
exhibits that which the senate erected to
the honour of the Emperor Trajan. Similar
columns were erected to the memory of many
of the Roman emperors.</p>

<p id="Coma">CŎMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόμη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κουρά</span>), the hair. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>
In the earliest times the Greeks wore their
hair long, and thus they are constantly called
in Homer <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καρηκομόωντες Ἀχαιοί</span>. The Spartan
boys always had their hair cut quite short (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐν
χρῷ κείροντες</span>); but as soon as they reached
the age of puberty (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφηβοι</span>), they let it grow
long. Before going to battle they combed
and dressed it with especial care. It seems that
both Spartan men and women tied their hair
in a knot over the crown of the head. The
custom of the Athenians was different. They
wore their hair long in childhood, and cut it
off when they reached the age of puberty.
The cutting off of the hair, which was always
done when a boy became an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφηβος</span>, was a
solemn act, attended with religious ceremonies.
A libation was first offered to Hercules,
which was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰνιστήρια</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰνιαστήρια</span>,
and the hair after being cut off was
dedicated to some deity, usually a river-god.
But when the Athenians passed into the age
of manhood, they again let their hair grow.
In ancient times at Athens the hair was
rolled up into a kind of knot on the crown of
the head, and fastened with golden clasps in
the shape of grasshoppers. This fashion of
wearing the hair was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρωβύλος</span>, and in
the case of females <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόρυμβος</span>. The heads of
females were frequently covered with a kind
of band or a coif of net-work. Of these coiffures
one was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφενδόνη</span>, which was a
broad band across the forehead, sometimes
made of metal, and sometimes of leather,
adorned with gold. But the most common
kind of head-dress for females was called by
the general name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</span>, and this was
divided into the three species of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάκκος</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίτρα</span>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεκρύφαλος</span>, in its
narrower sense, was a caul or coif of net-work,
corresponding to the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reticulum</i>.
These hair-nets were frequently made of gold
threads, sometimes of silk, or the Elean
byssus, and probably of other materials. The
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάκκος</span> and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίτρα</span> were, on the contrary,
made of close materials. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάκκος</span> covered
the head entirely like a sack or bag; it was
made of various materials, such as silk, byssus,
and wool. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίτρα</span> was a broad band of
cloth of different colours, which was wound
round the hair, and was worn in various
ways. It was originally an Eastern head-dress,
and may, therefore, be compared to the
modern turban. The Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calautica</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calvatica</i> is said by Servius to have been the
same as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mitra</i>, but in a passage in the
Digest they are mentioned as if they were
distinct.&mdash;With respect to the colour of the
hair, black was the most frequent, but <em>blonde</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξανθὴ κόμη</span>) was the most prized. In Homer,
Achilles, Ulysses, and other heroes are represented
with blonde hair. At a later time it
seems to have been not unfrequent to dye
hair, so as to make it either black or blonde,
and this was done by men as well as by
women, especially when the hair was growing
gray.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span> Besides the generic <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coma</i>
we also find the following words signifying the
hair: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capillus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caesaries</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crines</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cincinnus</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cirrus</i>, the two last words being used to
signify curled hair. In early times the Romans
wore their hair long, and hence the
Romans of the Augustan age designated their
ancestors <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intonsi</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capillati</i>. But after the
introduction of barbers into Italy about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
300, it became the practice to wear the hair
short. The women, too, originally dressed
their hair with great simplicity, but in the
Augustan period a variety of different head-dresses
came into fashion. Sometimes these
head-dresses were raised to a great height by
rows of false curls. So much attention did
the Roman ladies devote to the dressing of
the hair, that they kept slaves especially for
this purpose, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ornatrices</i>, and had them
instructed by a master in the art. Most of
the Greek head-dresses mentioned above were
also worn by the Roman ladies; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mitrae</i> appear to have been confined to prostitutes.
One of the simplest modes of wearing
the hair was allowing it to fall down in
tresses behind, and only confining it by a
band encircling the head. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Vitta">Vitta</a>.</span>] Another
favourite plan was platting the hair, and then
fastening it behind with a large pin. Blonde
hair was as much prized by the Romans as
by the Greeks, and hence the Roman ladies
used a kind of composition or wash to make
it appear this colour (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spuma caustica</i>). False
hair or wigs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φενάκη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πηνίκη</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">galerus</i>) were
worn both by Greeks and Romans. Among
both people likewise in ancient times the hair
was cut close in mourning [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a></span>]; and
among both the slaves had their hair cut
close as a mark of servitude.</p>


<p id="Comissatio">CŌMISSĀTĬO (derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῶμος</span>), the
name of a drinking entertainment, which
took place after the coena, from which, however,
it must be distinguished. The comissatio
was frequently prolonged to a late hour
at night, whence the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comissari</i> means
“to revel,” and the substantive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comissator</i> a
“reveller,” or “debauchee.”</p>


<p id="Comitia">CŎMĬTĬA. This word is formed from <em>co</em>,
<em>cum</em>, or <em>con</em>, and <em>ire</em>, and therefore <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitium</i>
is a place of meeting, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia</i> the meeting
itself, or the assembled people. In the
Roman constitution the comitia were the
ordinary and legal meetings or assemblies of
the people, and distinct from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contiones</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">concilia</i>. All the powers of government
were divided at Rome between the senate,
the magistrates, and the people in their assemblies.
Properly speaking, the people
alone (the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">populus</i>) was the real sovereign by
whom the power was delegated to the magistrates
and the senate. The sovereign people
or populus, however, was not the same at all
times. In the earliest times of Rome the
populus consisted of the patricians (or patres)
only, the plebs and the clients forming no
part of the populus, but being without the
pale of the state. The original populus was
divided into thirty <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiae</i>, and the assembly
of these curiae (the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia curiata</i>) was the
only assembly in which the populus was represented.
A kind of amalgamation of the
patricians and the plebs afterwards appeared
in the comitia of the centuries, instituted by
king Servius Tullius, and henceforth the term
populus was applied to the united patricians and
plebeians assembled in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia centuriata</i>.
But Servius had also made a local division of
the whole Roman territory into thirty tribes,
which held their meetings in assemblies called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia tributa</i>, which, in the course of time,
acquired the character of national assemblies,
so that the people thus assembled were likewise
designated by the term populus.</p>

<p>We shall examine in order the nature,
power, and business of each of these different
comitia. (1) <span id="Comitia_cu" class="smcap">Comitia curiata</span> consisted of
the members of the thirty curiae, that is,
the patricians, who formed exclusively the
populus in the early times. They were convened,
in the kingly period, by the king
himself, or by his tribunus celerum, and in
the king’s absence by the praefectus urbi.
After the death of a king the comitia were
held by the interrex. In the republican
period, the president was always one of the
high patrician magistrates, viz. a consul,
praetor, or dictator. They were called together
by lictors or heralds. The votes were
given by curiae, each curia having one collective
vote; but within a curia each citizen
belonging to it had an independent vote, and
the majority of the members of a curia determined
the vote of the whole curia. The
meeting was always held in the comitium.
The comitia curiata did not possess much
power in the kingly period. They could only
be called together when the king (or his representative)
chose, and could only determine
upon matters which the king submitted to
them. The main points upon which the populus
had to decide were the election of the
king, the passing of laws, declarations of war,
the capital punishment of Roman citizens,
and, lastly, certain affairs of the curiae and
gentes. The priestly officers, such as the
Curiones, Flamines Curiales, were likewise
either elected by the curiae, or at least inaugurated
by them. The right of finally deciding
upon the life of Roman citizens (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicia
de capite civis Romani</i>) is said to have been
given to the populus by king Tullus Hostilius.
It must further be remarked, that when the
king had been elected, the populus held a
second meeting, in which he was formally
inducted into his new office. This formality
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex curiata de imperio</i>, whereby
the king received his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium</i>, together
with the right of holding the comitia. Down
to the time of Servius Tullius, the comitia
curiata were the only popular assemblies of
Rome, and remained of course in the undiminished
possession of the rights above described;
but the constitution of that king
brought about a great change, by transferring
the principal rights which had hitherto been
enjoyed by the curiae to a new national assembly
or the comitia centuriata. But while
the patricians were obliged to share their
rights with the plebeians, they reserved for
themselves the very important right of sanctioning
or rejecting any measure which had
been passed by the centuries. The sanction
of decrees passed by the centuries is often expressed
by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores fiunt</i>, and down to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the time of the Publilian law no decree of the
centuries could become law without this sanction.
By the Publilian law (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 339) it was
enacted that the curiae should give their
assent before the vote of the comitia centuriata;
so that the veto of the curiae was thus
virtually abolished. The comitia curiata thus
became a mere formality, and, instead of the
thirty curiae themselves giving their votes,
the ceremony was performed by thirty lictors.
The comitia of the curiae were also called
<span id="Comitia_ca" class="smcap">Comitia calata</span> or “the summoned comitia”
(from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calare</i>, i.e. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vocare</i>), when summoned
for the purposes mentioned below:&mdash;1.
On the calends it was proclaimed to the
comitia calata on what day of the new
month the nones fell, and perhaps also the
ides as well as the nature of the other days,
namely, whether they were fasti or nefasti,
comitiales, feriae, &amp;c., because all these things
were known in the early times to the pontiffs
exclusively. 2. The inauguration of the
flamines, and after the banishment of the
kings, also that of the rex sacrorum. 3. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testamenti factio</i>, or the making of a will.
4. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">detestatio sacrorum</i>, which was in all
probability an act connected with the testamenti
factio, that is, a solemn declaration, by
which the heir was enjoined to undertake the
sacra privata of the testator along with the
reception of his property. The comitia calata
were summoned by the college of pontiffs,
who also presided in them.</p>

<p>(2) <span id="Comitia_ce" class="smcap">Comitia centuriata.</span> The object of the
legislation of Servius Tullius was to unite the
different elements of which the Roman people
consisted, into one great political body, in which
power and influence were to be determined by
property and age. The whole people was conceived
as an army (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exercitus</i>), and was therefore
divided into two parts, the cavalry
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equites</i>), and infantry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pedites</i>). The infantry
was divided into five classes, or, as
Dionysius has it, into six classes, for he regards
the whole body of people, whose property
did not come up to the census of the
fifth class, as a sixth. The class to which a
citizen belonged determined the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tributum</i>, or
war tax, he had to pay, as well as the kind
of service he had to perform in the army and
the armour in which he had to serve. But
for the purpose of voting in the comitia, each
class was subdivided into a number of centuries
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centuriae</i>, probably because each was
conceived to contain 100 men, though the
centuries may have greatly differed in the
number of men they contained). Hence the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comitia Centuriata</i>. Each century
was divided into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seniores</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">juniores</i>.
Each century, further, was counted as one
vote, so that a class had as many votes as it
contained centuries. In like manner, the
equites were divided into a number of centuries
or votes. The two principal authorities
on these subdivisions are Livy and Dionysius.
The annexed table will show the
census as well as the number of centuries or
votes assigned to each class.</p>

<p class="noindent">According to both Dionysius and Livy, the
equites voted in eighteen centuries before the
seniores of the first class; and hence there
were, according to Livy, 194, and, according
to Dionysius, 193 centuries or votes. The
latter number is the more probable, since
Livy’s even number of 194 centuries would
have rendered it impossible to obtain an absolute
majority. In this manner all Roman
citizens, whether patricians or plebeians, who
had property to a certain amount, were privileged
to take part and vote in the centuriata
comitia, and none were excluded except
slaves, peregrini, women and the aerarii.
The juniores were all men from the age of
seventeen to that of forty-six, and the seniores
all men from the age of forty-six upwards.
The order of voting was arranged in such a
manner, that if the eighteen centuries of the
equites and the eighty centuries of the first
class were agreed upon a measure, the question
was decided at once, there being no need
for calling upon the other classes to vote.
Hence, although all Roman citizens appeared
in these comitia on a footing of equality, yet
by far the greater power was thrown into the
hands of the wealthy.&mdash;As regards the functions
of the comitia centuriata, they were&mdash;(a.)
<em>The election of magistrates.</em> The magistrates
that were elected by the centuries are
the consuls (whence the assembly is called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia consularia</i>), the praetors (hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia
praetoria</i>), the military tribunes with
consular power, the censors, and the decemvirs.
(b.) <em>Legislation.</em> The legislative power
of the centuries at first consisted in their
passing or rejecting a measure which was
brought before them by the presiding magistrate
in the form of a senatus consultum, so
that the assembly had no right of originating
any legislative measure, but voted only upon
such as were brought before them as resolutions
of the senate. (c.) <em>The decision upon
war</em>, on the ground of a senatus consultum,
likewise belonged to the centuries. Peace
was concluded by a mere senatus consultum,
and without any co-operation of the people.
(d.) <em>The highest judicial power.</em> The comitia
centuriata were in the first place the highest
court of appeal, and in the second, they had
to try all offences committed against the
state; hence, all cases of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perduellio</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">majestas</i>:
and no case involving the life of a Roman
citizen could be decided by any other
court. The sanction of the curiae to the
measures of the centuriae has been already
explained.&mdash;The comitia centuriata could be
held only on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies comitiales</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasti</i>, on which it
was lawful to transact business with the people,
and the number of such days in every year
was about 190; but on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies nefasti</i> (that is,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies festi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriati</i>, comp. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Dies">Dies</a></span>), and, at first
also on the nundinae, no comitia could be
held, until in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 287 the Hortensian law
ordained that the nundinae should be regarded
as dies fasti.&mdash;The place where the
centuries met was the Campus Martius, which
contained the septa for the voters, a tabernaculum
for the president, and the villa publica
for the augurs.&mdash;The president at the
comitia was the same magistrate who convoked
them, and this right was a privilege of
the consuls, and, in their absence, of the
praetors. An interrex and dictator also, or
his representative, the magister equitum,
might likewise convene and preside at the
comitia. One of the main duties devolving
upon the president, and which he had to perform
before holding the comitia, was to consult
the auspices (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicari</i>). When the
auspices were favourable, the people were
called together, which was done by three successive
and distinct acts: the first was quite
a general invitation to come to the assembly
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inlicium</i>). At the same time when this invitation
was proclaimed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circum moeros</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de
moeris</i>, a horn was blown, which being the
more audible signal, is mentioned by some
writers alone, and without the inlicium.
When upon this signal the people assembled
in irregular masses, there followed the second
call by the accensus, or the call <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad contionem</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conventionem</i>; that is, to a regular assembly,
and the crowd then separated, grouping
themselves according to their classes and
ages. Hereupon the consul appeared, ordering
the people to come <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad comitia centuriata</i>;
and led the whole <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exercitus</i>&mdash;for, in these
comitia, the Roman people are always conceived
as an exercitus&mdash;out of the city, to the
Campus Martius.&mdash;It was customary from
the earliest times for an armed force to occupy
the Janiculum, when the people were
assembled in the Campus Martius, for the
purpose of protecting the city against any
sudden attack of the neighbouring people;
and on the Janiculum a vexillum was hoisted
during the whole time that the assembly
lasted. This custom continued to be observed
even at the time when Rome had no
longer anything to fear from the neighbouring
tribes.&mdash;When the people were thus regularly
assembled, the business was commenced
with a solemn sacrifice, and a prayer of the
president, who then took his seat on his tribunal.
The president then opened the business
by explaining to the people the subject
for which they had been convened, and concluded
his exposition with the words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velitis,
jubeatis Quirites</i>, e.g. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bellum indici</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut
M. Tullio aqua igni interdictum sit</i>, or whatever
the subject might be. This formula was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
the standing one in all comitia, and the whole
exposition of the president was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogatio</i>.
When the comitia were assembled for the
purpose of an election, the presiding magistrate
had to read out the names of the candidates,
and might exercise his influence by
recommending the one whom he thought
most fit for the office in question. If the
assembly had been convened for the purpose
of passing a legislative measure, the president
usually recommended the proposal, or he
might grant to others, if they desired it, permission
to speak about the measure, either
in its favour or against it (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contionem dare</i>).
When the comitia acted as a court of justice,
the president stated the crime, proposed the
punishment to be inflicted upon the offender,
and then allowed others to speak either in
defence of the accused or against him. When
the subject brought before the assembly was
sufficiently discussed, the president called
upon the people to prepare for voting by the
words, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ite in suffragium, bene juvantibus diis</i>.
He then passed the stream Petronia, and
went to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septa</i>.&mdash;Respecting the mode of
voting, it is commonly supposed that the
people were always polled by word of mouth,
till the passing of the leges tabellariae about
the middle of the second century before
Christ, when the ballot by means of tabellae
was introduced. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tabellariae">Leges Tabellariae</a>.</span>] It
appears, however, that the popular assemblies
voted by ballot, as well as by word of
mouth, long before the passing of the leges
tabellariae, but that instead of using tabellae,
they employed stones or pebbles (the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψῆφοι</span>), and that each voter received two
stones, one white and the other black, the
former to be used in the approval and the
latter in the condemnation of a measure.
The voting by word of mouth seems to have
been adopted in elections and trials, and the
use of pebbles to have been confined to the
enactment and repeal of laws. Previous to
the leges tabellariae, the rogatores, who subsequently
collected the written votes, stood
at the entrance of the septa, and asked every
citizen for his vote, which was taken down,
and used to determine the vote of each century.
After the introduction of the ballot, if
the business was the passing of a law, each
citizen was provided with two tabellae, one
inscribed V. R. <em>i.e.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Uti Rogas</i>, “I vote for
the law,” the other inscribed A. <em>i.e.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiquo</i>,
“I am for the old law.” If the business
was the election of a magistrate, each citizen
was supplied with only one tablet, on which
the names of the candidates were written, or
the initials of their names; the voter then
placed a mark (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">punctum</i>) against the one for
whom he voted, whence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puncta</i> are spoken of
in the sense of votes. For further particulars
respecting the voting in the comitia, see
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Diribitores">Diribitores</a></span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Situla">Situla</a></span>. In judicial assemblies
every citizen was provided with three
tabellae, one of which was marked with A.
<em>i.e.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Absolvo</i>, “I acquit;” the second with C.
<em>i.e.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Condemno</i>, “I condemn;” and the third
with N. L. <em>i.e.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non Liquet</i>, “It is not clear
to me.” The first of these was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabella
absolutoria</i> and the second <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabella damnatoria</i>,
and hence Cicero calls the former <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litera
salutaris</i>, and the latter <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litera tristis</i>.&mdash;There
were in the Campus Martius septa or inclosures
(whether they existed from the earliest
times is unknown), into which one class of
citizens was admitted after another for the
purpose of voting. The first that entered
were the eighteen centuries of the equites,
then followed the first class and so on. It
very rarely happened that the lowest class
was called upon to vote, as there was no necessity
for it, unless the first class did not
agree with the equites. After the time when
the comitia of the centuries became amalgamated
with those of the tribes, a large space
near the villa publica was surrounded with
an enclosure, and divided into compartments
for the several tribes. The whole of this enclosure
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ovile, septa, carceres</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cancelli</i>; and in later times a stone building,
containing the whole people, was erected; it
was divided into compartments for the classes
as well as the tribes and centuries; the access
to these compartments was formed by
narrow passages called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontes</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ponticuli</i>.
On entering, the citizens received their tablets,
and when they had consulted within
the enclosures, they passed out of them again
by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ponticulus</i>, at which they threw
their vote into a chest (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cista</i>) which was
watched by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogatores</i>. Hereupon the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogatores</i>
collected the tablets, and gave them to
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diribitores</i>, who classified and counted the
votes, and then handed them over to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">custodes</i>,
who again checked them off by points
marked on a tablet. The order in which the
centuries voted was determined in the Servian
constitution, in the manner described
above; but after the union of the centuries
and tribes, the order was determined by lot;
and this was a matter of no slight importance,
since it frequently happened that the
vote of the first determined the manner in
which subsequent ones voted. In the case of
elections, the successful candidate was proclaimed
twice, first by the praeco, and then
by the president, and without this renuntiatio
the election was not valid. After all the
business was done, the president pronounced
a prayer, and dismissed the assembly with
the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discedite</i>.&mdash;Cases are frequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
mentioned in which the proceedings of the
assembly were disturbed, so that it was necessary
to defer the business till another day.
This occurred&mdash;1, when it was discovered
that the auspices had been unfavourable, or
when the gods manifested their displeasure
by rain, thunder, or lightning; 2, when a
tribune interceded; 3, when the sun set before
the business was over, for it was a principle
that the auspices were valid only for
one day from sunrise to sunset; 4, when a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">morbus comitialis</i> occurred, <em>i.e.</em> when one of
the assembled citizens was seized with an
epileptic fit; 5, when the vexillum was taken
away from the Janiculum, this being a signal
which all citizens had to obey; 6, when any
tumult or insurrection broke out in the city.</p>

<p>(3) <span id="Comitia_tr" class="smcap">Comitia tributa.</span> These assemblies
likewise were called into existence by the
constitution of Servius Tullius, who divided
the Roman territory into thirty local tribes.
It is a disputed question whether the patricians
were originally included in these
tribes; but, whether they were or not, it is
certain, that by far the majority of the people
in the tribes were plebeians, and that,
consequently, the character of these assemblies
was essentially plebeian. After the
decemvirate, the patricians had certainly
the right of voting in the assemblies of the
tribes, which were then also convened by the
higher magistrates. The assemblies of the
tribes had originally only a local power; they
were intended to collect the tributum, and to
furnish the contingents for the army; they
may further have discussed the internal affairs
of each tribe, such as the making or keeping
up of roads, wells, and the like. But their
influence gradually increased, and they at
length acquired the following powers:&mdash;1.
<em>The election of the inferior magistrates</em>,
whose office it was to protect the commonalty
or to superintend the affairs of the tribes.
Hence the tribunes of the plebs were elected
in the comitia tributa. In like manner, the
aediles were elected by them, though the
curule aediles were elected at a different
time from the plebeian aediles and under the
presidency of a consul. At a still later time,
the quaestors and tribunes of the soldiers,
who had before been appointed by the consuls,
were appointed in the assemblies of the
tribes. The proconsuls to be sent into the
provinces, and the prolongation of the imperium
for a magistrate who was already in
a province, were likewise points which were
determined by the tribes in later times. The
inferior magistrates elected by the tribes
are:&mdash;the triumviri capitales, triumviri monetales,
the curatores viarum, decemviri litibus
judicandis, tribuni aerarii, magistri
vicorum et pagorum, praefecti annonae, duumviri
navales, quinqueviri muris turribusque
reficiendis, triumviri coloniae deducendae,
triumviri, quatuorviri, &amp;c., mensarii,
and lastly, after the Domitian law, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 104,
also the members of colleges of priests. The
pontifex maximus had been elected by the
people from an earlier time. 2. <em>The legislative
power</em> of the comitia tributa was at first
very insignificant, for all they could do was
to make regulations concerning the local
affairs of the tribes. But after a time, when
the tribes began to be the real representatives
of the people, matters affecting the whole
people also were brought before them by the
tribunes, which, framed as resolutions, were
laid before the senate, where they might
either be sanctioned or rejected. This practice
of the tributa comitia gradually acquired
for them the right of taking the initiative
in any measure, or the right of originating
measures, until, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 449, this right was
recognised and sanctioned by a law of L.
Valerius Publicola and M. Horatius Barbatus.
This law gave to the decrees passed by the
tribes the power of a real <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex</i>, binding upon
the whole people, provided they obtained the
sanction of the senate and the populus, that
is, the people assembled in the comitia curiata
or in the comitia centuriata. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
339, the Publilian law enacted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut plebiscita
omnes Quirites tenerent</i>. This law was either
a re-enactment of the one passed in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 449,
or contained a more detailed specification of
the cases in which plebiscita should be binding
upon the whole nation, or, lastly, it
made their validity independent of the sanction
of other comitia, so that nothing would
be required except the assent of the senate. In
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 287, the Hortensian law was passed,
which seems to have been only a revival and
a confirmation of the two preceding laws, for
it was framed in almost the same terms; but
it may also be, that the Hortensian law made
the plebiscita independent of the sanction of
the senate, so that henceforth the comitia
tributa were quite independent in their legislative
character. 3. <em>The judicial power</em> of
the comitia tributa was much more limited
than that of the comitia centuriata, inasmuch
as they could take cognizance only of
offences against the majesty of the people,
while all crimes committed against the state
were brought before the centuries. Even
patricians, when they had offended against
the commonalty or its members, were tried
and fined by the tribes. This again constitutes
a difference between the judicial power
of the centuries and that of the tribes, for
the former could inflict capital punishment,
but the latter only fines. The comitia tributa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
might assemble either within or without
the city, but not farther from it than
1000 paces, because the power of the tribunes
did not extend farther. For elections
the Campus Martius was usually chosen, but
sometimes also the forum, the Capitol, or the
Circus Flaminius. The presidents were commonly
the tribunes, who were supported by
the aediles, and no matter could be brought
before the tribes without the knowledge and
consent of the tribunes. As the comitia tributa,
however, more and more assumed the
character of national assemblies, the higher
magistrates also sometimes acted as presidents,
though perhaps not without previously
obtaining the permission of the tribunes.
The preparations for the comitia tributa were
less formal and solemn than for those of the
centuries. In the case of elections, the candidates
had to give in their names, and the
president communicated them to the people.
When a legislative measure was to be brought
before the assembly, a tribune made the
people acquainted with it in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contiones</i>, and
that on the three preceding nundines. The
same was the case when the people were to
meet as a court of justice. The auspicia
were not consulted for the comitia of the
tribes, but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spectio</i> alone was sufficient,
and the tribunes had the right of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obnuntiatio</i>.
In the comitia the tribune who had been
chosen to preside sat on the tribunal supported
by his colleagues, and laid before the
people the subject of the meeting, concluding
with the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velitis, jubeatis Quirites</i>. The
bill was never read by the tribune himself,
but by a praeco, and then began the debates,
in which persons might either oppose or recommend
the measure, though private persons
had to ask the tribunes for permission
to speak. When the discussion was over the
president called upon the people <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ite in suffragium</i>,
as at the comitia centuriata. They
then formed themselves into their tribes,
which, like the centuries, ascertained their
own votes in enclosures (septa). Which of
the 35 tribes was to give its vote first, was
determined by lot, and that tribe was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praerogativa</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">principium</i> (the others were
termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure vocatae</i>). The vote of the first
tribe was given by some person of distinction
whose name was mentioned in the plebiscitum,
if it was of a legislative nature. The
manner of collecting the votes was, on the
whole, the same as in the comitia centuriata.
The announcing of the result of the votes
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">renuntiatio</i>. If it so happened that
two candidates had the same number of votes,
the question was decided by drawing lots.
The circumstances which might cause the
meeting to break up and defer its business till
another day, are the same as those which
put an end to the comitia centuriata.</p>

<p>(4) <em>The comitia centuriata mixed with the
comitia tributa.</em>&mdash;The Servian constitution
was retained unaltered so long as no great
change took place in the republic; but when
the coinage and the standard of property had
become altered, when the constitution of the
army had been placed on a different footing,
and, above all, when the plebeians began to
be recognized as a great and essential element
in the Roman state, it must have been
found inconvenient to leave to the equites and
the first class so great a preponderance in
the comitia of the centuries, and it became
necessary to secure more power and influence
to the democratic element. A change, therefore,
took place, and the comitia centuriata
became mixed with the comitia tributa; but
neither the time nor the exact nature of this
change is accurately ascertained. Some refer
it to the censorship of C. Flaminius, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 220,
others to that of Q. Fabius and P. Decius,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 304. But there is evidence that it must
be assigned to even an earlier date than this,
for the (tribus) praerogativa is mentioned as
early as <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 396 in the election of the consular
tribunes, where the pure comitia tributa
cannot be meant, and a centuria praerogativa
is a thing unknown. With regard to
the manner of the change, the most probable
opinion is, that the citizens of each tribe were
divided into five property classes, each consisting
of seniores and juniores, so that each
of the 35 tribes contained ten centuries, and
all the tribes together 350 centuries. According
to this new arrangement, the five ancient
classes, divided into seniores and juniores,
continued to exist as before, but henceforth
they were most closely united with the tribes,
whereas before the tribes had been mere
local divisions and entirely independent of
property. The union now effected was that
the classes became subdivisions of the tribes,
and that accordingly centuries occur both in
the classes and in the tribes. Each tribe contained
ten centuries, two of the first class
(one of the seniores and one of the juniores),
two of the second (likewise seniores and
juniores), two of the third, two of the fourth,
and two of the fifth class. The equites were
likewise divided according to tribes and centuries,
and they seem to have voted with the
first class, and to have been in fact included
in it, so as to be called centuries of the first
class. The centuries of the cornicines, tubicines
and fabri, which are no longer mentioned,
probably ceased to exist as distinct
centuries. The voting by tribes can hardly
be conceived, except in those cases in which
the ten centuries of every tribe were unanimous;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
this may have been the case very
often, and when it was so, the tribus praerogativa
was certainly the tribe chosen by
lot to give its unanimous vote first. But if
there was any difference of opinion among the
centuries making up a tribe, the true majority
could only be ascertained by choosing by lot
one of the 70 centuriae of the first class to
give its vote first, or rather it was decided by
lot from which tribe the two centuries of the
first class were to be taken to give their vote
first. (Hence the plural <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praerogativae</i>.) The
tribe, moreover, to which those centuries
belonged which voted first, was itself likewise
called tribus praerogativa. Of the two centuries,
again, that of seniores gave its vote
before the juniores, and in the documents
both were called by the name of their tribe,
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galeria juniorum</i>, <em>i.e.</em> the juniores of the
first class in the tribus Galeria, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aniensis juniorum,
Veturia juniorum</i>. As soon as the
praerogativa had voted, the renuntiatio took
place, and the remaining centuries then deliberated
whether they should vote the same
way or not. When this was done all the
centuries of the first tribe proceeded to vote
at once, for there would not have been time
for the 350 centuries to vote one after another,
as was done by the 193 centuries in the
comitia centuriata.&mdash;These comitia of the
centuries combined with the tribes were far
more democratical than the comitia of the
centuries; they continued to be held, and
preserved their power along with the comitia
tributa, even after the latter had acquired
their supreme importance in the republic.
During the time of the moral and political
corruption of the Romans, the latter appear
to have been chiefly attended by the populace,
which was guided by the tribunes, and the
wealthier and more respectable citizens had
little influence in them. When the libertini
and all the Italians were incorporated in the
old thirty-five tribes, and when the political
corruption had reached its height, no trace of
the sedate and moderate character was left by
which the comitia tributa had been distinguished
in former times. Under Augustus
the comitia still sanctioned new laws and
elected magistrates, but their whole proceedings
were a mere farce, for they could not
venture to elect any other persons than those
recommended by the emperor. Tiberius deprived
the people even of this shadow of their
former power, and conferred the power of
election upon the senate. When the elections
were made by the senate the result was announced
to the people assembled as comitia
centuriata or tributa. Legislation was taken
away from the comitia entirely, and was completely
in the hands of the senate and the
emperor. From this time the comitia may be
said to have ceased to exist, as all the sovereign
power formerly possessed by the people
was conferred upon the emperor by the lex
regia. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Regia">Lex Regia</a>.</span>]</p>

<p id="Comoedia">CŌMOEDĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κωμῳδία</span>), comedy. (1)
<span class="smcap">Greek.</span> Comedy took its rise at the vintage
festivals of Dionysus. It originated with
those who led off the phallic songs of the
band of revellers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῶμος</span>), who at the vintage
festivals of Dionysus gave expression to the
feelings of exuberant joy and merriment which
were regarded as appropriate to the occasion,
by parading about, partly on foot, partly in
waggons, with the symbol of the productive
powers of nature, singing a wild, jovial song
in honour of Dionysus and his companions.
These songs were commonly interspersed
with, or followed by petulant, extemporal
witticisms with which the revellers assailed
the bystanders. This origin of comedy is
indicated by the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κωμῳδία</span>, which undoubtedly
means “the song of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῶμος</span>,”
though it has sometimes been derived from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κώμη</span>, as if the meaning were “a village
song.” It was among the Dorians that
comedy first assumed any thing of a regular
shape. The Megarians, both in the mother
country and in Sicily, claimed to be considered
as its originators, and so far as the
comedy of Athens is concerned, the claim of
the former appears well founded. Among
the Athenians the first attempts at comedy
were made at Icaria by Susarion, a native of
Megara, about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 578. Susarion no doubt
substituted for the more ancient improvisations
of the chorus and its leader premeditated
compositions. There would seem also
to have been some kind of poetical contest,
for we learn that the prize for the successful
poet was a basket of figs and a jar of wine.
It was also the practice of those who took
part in the comus to smear their faces with
wine-lees, either to prevent their features
from being recognised, or to give themselves
a more grotesque appearance. Hence comedy
came to be called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρυγῳδία</span>, or lee-song.
Others connected the name with the circumstance
of a jar of new wine (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρύξ</span>) being the
prize for the successful poet. It was, however,
in Sicily, that comedy was earliest
brought to something like perfection. Epicharmus
was the first writer who gave it a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
new form, and introduced a regular plot.
In his efforts he appears to have been associated
with Phormis, a somewhat older contemporary.
The Megarians in Sicily claimed
the honour of the invention of comedy, on
account of Epicharmus having lived in Megara
before he went to Syracuse. In Attica,
the first comic poet of any importance whom
we hear of after Susarion is Chionides, who
is said to have brought out plays in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 488.
Euetes, Euxenides, and Myllus were probably
contemporaries of Chionides; he was
followed by Magnes and Ecphantides. Their
compositions, however, seem to have been
little but the reproduction of the old Megaric
farce of Susarion, differing, no doubt, in
form, by the introduction of an actor or
actors, separate from the chorus, in imitation
of the improvements that had been made in
tragedy.&mdash;That branch of the Attic drama
which was called the <em>Old Comedy</em>, begins
properly with Cratinus, who was to comedy
very much what Aeschylus was to tragedy.
The old comedy has been described as the
comedy of caricature, and such indeed it was,
but it was also a great deal more. As it appeared
in the hands of its great masters Cratinus,
Hermippus, Eupolis, and especially
Aristophanes, its main characteristic was
that it was throughout <em>political</em>. Everything
that bore upon the political or social interests
of the Athenians furnished materials for it.
The old Attic comedy lasted from Ol. 80 to
Ol. 94 (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 458-404). From Cratinus to
Theopompus there were forty-one poets, fourteen
of whom preceded Aristophanes. The
later pieces of Aristophanes belong to the
Middle rather than to the Old Comedy. The
chorus in a comedy consisted of twenty-four.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a>.</span>] The dance of the chorus was the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόρδαξ</span>, the movements of which were capricious
and licentious, consisting partly in a
reeling to and fro, in imitation of a drunken
man, and in various unseemly and immodest
gestures. Comedies have choric songs, but
no <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στάσιμα</span>, or songs between acts. The most
important of the choral parts was the Parabasis,
when the actors having left the stage, the
chorus, which was ordinarily divided into four
rows, containing six each, and was turned
towards the stage, turned round, and advancing
towards the spectators delivered an
address to them in the name of the poet,
either on public topics of general interest, or
on matters which concerned the poet personally,
criticising his rivals and calling attention
to his merits; the address having
nothing whatever to do with the action of the
play. The parabasis was not universally introduced:
three plays of Aristophanes, the
Ecclesiazusae, Lysistrata, and Plutus, have
none. As the old Attic comedy was the offspring
of the political and social vigour and
freedom of the age during which it flourished,
it naturally declined and ceased with the decline
and overthrow of the freedom and vigour
which were necessary for its development.&mdash;It
was replaced by a comedy of a
somewhat different style, which was known
as the <em>Middle Comedy</em>, the age of which
lasted from the end of the Peloponnesian war
to the overthrow of liberty by Philip of Macedon.
(Ol. 94-110.) The comedy of this
period found its materials in satirizing classes
of people instead of individuals, in criticising
the systems and merits of philosophers and
literary men, and in parodies of the compositions
of living and earlier poets, and travesties
of mythological subjects. It formed
a transition from the old to the new comedy,
and approximated to the latter in the greater
attention to the construction of plots which
seem frequently to have been founded on
amorous intrigues, and in the absence of that
wild grotesqueness which marked the old
comedy. As regards its external form, the
plays of the middle comedy, generally speaking,
had neither parabasis nor chorus. The most
celebrated authors of the middle comedy were
Antiphanes and Alexis.&mdash;The <em>New Comedy</em>
was a further development of the last mentioned
kind. It answered as nearly as may
be to the modern comedy of manners or character.
Dropping for the most part personal
allusions, caricature, ridicule, and parody,
which, in a more general form than in the
old comedy, had maintained their ground in
the middle comedy, the poets of the new
comedy made it their business to reproduce
in a generalized form a picture of the every-day
life of those by whom they were surrounded.
There were various standing characters
which found a place in most plays,
such as we find in the plays of Plautus and
Terence, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leno perjurus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amator fervidus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">servulus callidus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amica illudens</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sodalis opitulator</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miles proeliator</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parasitus edax</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parentes
tenaces</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meretrices procaces</i>. In
the new comedy there was no chorus. It
flourished from about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 340 to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 260.
The poets of the new comedy amounted to 64
in number. The most distinguished was
Menander.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span>&mdash;The accounts of
the early stages of comic poetry among the
Romans are scanty. Scenic entertainments
were introduced at Rome in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 363 from
Etruria, where it would seem they were a
familiar amusement. Tuscan players (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludiones</i>),
who were fetched from Etruria, exhibited
a sort of pantomimic dance to the

their dance, and without regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
dramatic gesticulation. The amusement became
popular, and was imitated by the young
Romans, who improved upon the original
entertainment by uniting with it extemporaneous
mutual raillery, composed in a rude
irregular measure, a species of diversion
which had been long known among the Romans
at their agrarian festivals under the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fescennina</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fescennina">Fescennina</a></span>]. It was
123 years after the first introduction of these
scenic performances before the improvement
was introduced of having a regular plot.
This advance was made by Livius Andronicus,
a native of Magna Graecia, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 240. His
pieces, which were both tragedies and comedies,
were merely adaptations of Greek
dramas. The representation of regular plays
of this sort was now left to those who were
histriones by profession, and who were very
commonly either foreigners or slaves; the
free-born youth of Rome confined their own
scenic performances to the older, irregular
farces, which long maintained their ground,
and were subsequently called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exodia</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Exodia">Exodia</a>;
<a href="#Satura">Satura</a>.</span>] Livius, as was common at
that time, was himself an actor in his own
pieces. The first imitator of the dramatic
works of Livius Andronicus was Cn. Naevius,
a native of Campania. He composed
both tragedies and comedies, which were
either translations or imitations of those of
Greek writers. The most distinguished successors
of Naevius were Plautus, who chiefly
imitated Epicharmus, and Terence, whose
materials were drawn mostly from Menander,
Diphilus, Philemon, and Apollodorus. The
comedy of the Romans was throughout but
an imitation of that of the Greeks, and
chiefly of the new comedy. Where the characters
were ostensibly Greek, and the scene
laid in Athens or some other Greek town, the
comedies were termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palliatae</i>. All the
comedies of Terence and Plautus belong to
this class. When the story and characters
were Roman, the plays were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">togatae</i>.
But the fabulae togatae were in fact little else
than Greek comedies clothed in a Latin dress.</p>

<p>The togatae were divided into two classes,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trabeatae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabernariae</i>, according as the
subject was taken from high or from low life.
In the comediae palliatae, the costume of the
ordinary actors was the Greek pallium. The
plays which bore the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetextatae</i>,
were not so much tragedies as historical
plays. It is a mistake to represent them as
comedies. There was a species of tragi-comedy,
named from the poet who introduced
that style <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhinthonica</i>. A tragedy the
argument of which was Greek was termed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crepidata</i>. The mimes are sometimes classed
with the Latin comedies. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mimus">Mimus</a>.</span>] The
mimes differed from the comedies in little
more than the predominance of the mimic
representation over the dialogue. Latin comedies
had no chorus, any more than the
dramas of the new comedy, of which they
were for the most part imitations. Like
them, too, they were introduced by a prologue,
which answered some of the purposes
of the parabasis of the old comedy, so far as
bespeaking the good will of the spectators,
and defending the poet against his rivals and
enemies. It also communicated so much information
as was necessary to understand
the story of the play. The prologue was
commonly spoken by one of the players, or,
perhaps, by the manager of the troop. Respecting
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atellanae fabulae</i> see that article.</p>


<p id="Compitalia">COMPĬTĀLĬA, also called LŪDI COMPĬTĀLĬCĬI,
a festival celebrated once a year in
honour of the lares compitales, to whom sacrifices
were offered at the places where two
or more ways met. In the time of Augustus,
the ludi compitalicii had gone out of fashion,
but were restored by him. The compitalia
belonged to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriae conceptivae</i>, that is,
festivals which were celebrated on days appointed
annually by the magistrates or
priests. The exact day on which this festival
was celebrated appears to have varied,
though it was always in the winter, generally
at the beginning of January.</p>

<p id="Concilium">CONCĬLĬUM generally has the same
meaning as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conventus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conventio</i>, but the
technical import of concilium in the Roman
constitution was an assembly of a <em>portion</em> of
the people as distinct from the general assemblies
or comitia. Accordingly, as the
comitia tributa embraced only a portion of
the Roman people, viz. the plebeians, these
comitia are often designated by the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">concilia
plebis</i>. Concilium is also used by Latin
writers to denote the assemblies or meetings
of confederate towns or nations, at which
either their deputies alone or any of the
citizens met who had time and inclination,
and thus formed a representative assembly.
Such an assembly or diet is commonly designated
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commune concilium</i>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ κοινόν</span>,
e.g. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Achaeorum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aetolorum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Boeotorum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macedoniae</i>,

the early times of the Roman republic the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">congius</i> was the usual measure of oil or wine
which was, on certain occasions, distributed
among the people; and thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">congiarium</i> became
a name for liberal donations to the
people, in general, whether consisting of oil,
wine, corn, money, or other things, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
donations made to the soldiers were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donativa</i>, though they were sometimes also
termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">congiaria</i>. Many coins of the Roman
emperors were struck in commemoration of
such congiaria. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Congiarium</i> was, moreover,
occasionally used simply to designate a present
or a pension given by a person of high
rank, or a prince, to his friends.</p>

<p id="Consualia">CONSUĀLĬA, a festival, with games, celebrated
by the Romans, according to Ovid and
others, in honour of Consus, the god of
secret deliberations, or, according to Livy, of
Neptunus Equestris. Some writers, however,
say that Neptunus Equestris and Consus
were only different names for one and
the same deity. It was solemnised every
year in the circus, by the symbolical ceremony
of uncovering an altar dedicated to the
god, which was buried in the earth. For
Romulus, who was considered as the founder
of the festival, was said to have discovered
an altar in the earth on that spot. The solemnity
took place on the 21st of August
with horse and chariot races, and libations
were poured into the flames which consumed
the sacrifices. During these festive games
horses and mules were not allowed to do any
work, and were adorned with garlands of
flowers. It was at their first celebration that,
according to the ancient legend, the Sabine
maidens were carried off.</p>


<p id="Consul">CONSUL (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕπατος</span>), the title of the two
chief officers or magistrates of the Roman
republic. The word is probably composed of
<em>con</em> and <em>sul</em>, which contains the same root as
the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salio</i>, so that consules signifies
“those who come together,” just as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praesul</i>
means “one who goes before,” and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsul</i>,
“one who goes out.” The consulship is said
to have been instituted upon the expulsion of
the kings in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 509, when the kingly power
was transferred to two magistrates, whose
office lasted only for one year, that it might
not degenerate into tyranny by being vested
longer in the same persons; and for the same
reason two were appointed instead of one
king, as neither could undertake anything
unless it was sanctioned and approved by his
colleague. Their original title was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetores</i>,
or commanders of the armies, but this was
changed into that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consules</i> in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 449,
and the latter title remained in use until the
latest periods of the Roman empire.&mdash;The
consuls were at first elected from the patricians
exclusively. Their office was suspended
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 451, and its functions were performed
by ten high commissioners (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decemviri</i>),
appointed to frame a code of laws. On
the re-establishment of the consulship in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
449, the tribunes proposed that one of the
consuls should be chosen from the plebeians,
but this was strenuously resisted by the patricians,
and a compromise effected by suspending
the consular office, and creating in
its stead military tribunes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni militum</i>)
with consular power, who might be elected
indifferently both from the patricians and
plebeians. They were first appointed in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
444. The plebeians, however, were not satisfied
with this concession, and still endeavoured
to attain the higher dignity of the
consulship. At length, after a serious and
long-protracted struggle between the two
orders, it was enacted by the Licinian law,
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 367, that henceforth the consulship
should be divided between the patricians and
plebeians, and that one of the consuls should
always be a plebeian. Accordingly, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
366 L. Sextius was elected the first plebeian
consul. This law, however, was not always
observed, and it still frequently happened
that both consuls were patricians, until, in
later times, when the difference between the
two orders had entirely ceased, and the plebeians
were on a footing of perfect equality
with the patricians, the consuls were elected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
from both orders indiscriminately.&mdash;During
the later periods of the republic it was customary
for persons to pass through several
subordinate magistracies before they were
elected consuls, though this rule was departed
from in many particular cases. The
age at which a person was eligible to the
consulship was fixed in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 180, by the lex
annalis [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Annalis">Lex Annalis</a></span>], at 43.&mdash;The election
of the consuls always took place in the comitia
of the centuries, some time before the
expiration of the official year of the actual
consuls, and the election was conducted
either by the actual consuls themselves, or
by an interrex or a dictator, and the persons
elected, until they entered upon their office,
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consules designati</i>. While they
were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">designati</i>, they were in reality no more
than private persons, but still they might
exercise considerable influence upon public
affairs, for in the senate they were asked for
their opinion first. If they had been guilty
of any illegal act, either before or during
their election, such as bribery (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ambitus</i>), they
were liable to prosecution, and the election
might be declared void.&mdash;The time at which
the old consuls laid down their office and the
consules designati entered upon theirs, differed
at different times. The first consuls
are said to have entered upon their office in
October, then we find mention of the 1st of
August, of the ides of December, the 1st of
July, and very frequently of the ides of
March, until, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 153, it became an established
rule for the consuls to enter upon
their duties on the 1st of January; and this
custom remained down to the end of the republic.
On that day the senators, equites,
and citizens of all classes conducted in a procession
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deductio</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">processus consularis</i>) the
new magistrates from their residence to the
capitol, where, if the auspices were favourable,
the consuls offered up sacrifices, and
were inaugurated. From thence the procession
went to the curia, where the senate
assembled, and where the consuls returned
thanks for their election. There they might
also speak on any subject that was of importance
to the republic, such as peace and
war, the distribution of provinces, the general
condition of the state, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriae Latinae</i>,
and the like. During the first five days of
their office they had to convoke a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contio</i>, and
publicly to take a solemn oath, by which, in
the earliest times, they pledged themselves
not to allow any one to assume regal power
at Rome, but afterwards only to maintain the
laws of the republic (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in leges jurare</i>). On the
expiration of their office they had to take
another oath, stating that they had faithfully
obeyed the laws, and not done anything
against the constitution. The new consuls
on entering upon their office usually invited
their friends to a banquet. When a consul
died during his year of office, his colleague
immediately convoked the comitia to elect a
new one. A consul thus elected to fill a
vacancy was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consul suffectus</i>, but his
powers were not equal to those of an ordinary
consul, for he could not preside at the
elections of other magistrates, not even in
the case of the death of his colleague. In the
latter case, as well as when the consuls were
prevented by illness or other circumstances,
the comitia were held by an interrex or a
dictator.&mdash;The outward distinctions of the
consuls were, with few exceptions, the same
as those which had formerly belonged to the
kings. The principal distinction was the
twelve lictors with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasces</i>, who preceded
the consuls; but the axes did not appear in
the fasces within the city. This outward
sign of their power was taken by the consuls
in turn every month, and while one
consul was preceded by the twelve lictors
with their fasces, the other was during the
same month preceded by an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accensus</i>, and
followed by the lictors; and the one was
called during that month <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consul major</i>, and
the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consul minor</i>. Other distinctions
of the consuls were the curule chair (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sella
curulis</i>), and the toga with the purple hem
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</i>). The ivory sceptre (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scipio</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sceptrum</i>) and purple toga were not distinctions
of the consuls in general, but only
when they celebrated a triumph. Under the
empire a consul was sometimes distinguished
by the senate with a sceptre bearing an eagle
on the top, but his regular ensigns consisted
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga picta</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trabea</i>, and the fasces,
both within and without the city.&mdash;The consuls
were the highest ordinary magistrates at
Rome. Their power was at first quite equal
to that of the kings, except that it was
limited to one year, and that the office of
high priest, which had been vested in the
king, was at the very beginning detached
from the consulship, and given to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rex
sacrorum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rex sacrificulus</i>. Yet the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia
majora</i> continued to belong to the
consuls. This regal power of the consuls,
however, was gradually curtailed by various
laws, especially by the institution of the tribunes
of the plebs, whose province it was to
protect the plebeians against the unjust or
oppressive commands of the patrician magistrates.
Nay, in the course of time, whole
branches of the consular power were detached
from it; the reason for which was, that, as
the patricians were compelled to allow the
plebeians a share in the highest magistracy,
they stripped it of as much of its original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
power as they could, and reserved these detached
portions for themselves. In this manner
the censorship was detached from the
consulship in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 443, and the praetorship
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 367. But notwithstanding all this,
the consuls remained the highest magistrates,
and all other magistrates, except the tribunes
of the plebs, were obliged to obey their commands,
and show them great outward respect.
The functions of the consuls during
the time of the republic may be conveniently
described under the following heads:&mdash;1.
They were in all civil matters the heads of
the state, being invested with the imperium,
which emanated from the sovereign people,
and which they held during the time of their
office. In this capacity they had the right of
convoking both the senate and the assembly
of the people; they presided in each (in the
comitia of the curies as well as in those of
the centuries), and they took care that the
resolutions of the senate and people were
carried into effect. They might also convoke
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contiones</i>, whenever they thought it necessary.
In the senate they conducted the discussions,
and put the questions to the vote,
thus exercising the greatest influence upon
all matters which were brought before the
senate either by themselves or by others.
When a decree was passed by the senate, the
consuls were usually commissioned to see that
it was carried into effect; though there are
also instances of the consuls opposing a decree
of the senate. 2. The supreme command
of the armies belonged to the consuls
alone by virtue of their imperium. Accordingly,
when a war was decreed, they were
ordered by a senatus consultum to levy the
troops, whose number was determined by the
senate, and they appointed most of the other
military officers. While at the head of their
armies they had full power of life and death
over their soldiers, who, on their enrolment,
had to take an oath (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacramentum</i>) to be
faithful and obedient to the commands of the
consuls. When the consuls had entered upon
their office, the senate assigned them their
provinces, that is, their spheres of action,
and the consuls either settled between themselves
which province each was to have, or,
which was more common, they drew lots.
Usually one consul remained at Rome, while
the other went out at the head of the army:
sometimes both left the city, and carried on
war in different quarters; and sometimes,
when the danger was very pressing, both
consuls commanded the armies against one
and the same enemy. If it was deemed advisable,
the imperium of one or of both consuls
was prolonged for the particular province
in which they were engaged, in which case
they had the title of proconsuls [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Proconsul">Proconsul</a></span>],
and their successors either remained at
Rome, or were engaged in other quarters.
During the latter period of the republic the
consuls remained at Rome during the time of
their office, and on its expiration they had a
foreign province (in the real sense of the
word) assigned to them, where they undertook
either the peaceful administration, or
carried on war against internal or external
enemies. While in their provinces, both
the consuls and proconsuls had the power
of life and death over the provincials, for
they were looked upon there as the chief
military commanders; and the provincials,
being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peregrini</i>, did not enjoy the privileges
of Roman citizens. 3. The supreme jurisdiction
was part of the consular imperium, and
as such vested in the consuls so long as there
were no praetors. In civil cases they administered
justice to the patricians as well as
plebeians, either acting themselves as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judices</i>,
or appointing others as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judices</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbitri</i>.
In criminal cases there appears from early
times to have been this difference: that patricians
charged with capital offences were
tried by the curies, while the plebeians came
under the jurisdiction of the consuls, whose
power, however, was in this case rather
limited, partly by the intercession of the tribunes
of the people, and partly by the right
of appeal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">provocatio</i>) from the sentence of
the consuls. The consuls might, further,
summon any citizen before their tribunal,
and, in case of disobedience, seize him (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prendere</i>),
and fine him up to a certain amount.
After the institution of the praetorship, the
consuls no longer possessed any regular ordinary
jurisdiction; and whenever they exercised
it, it was an exception to the general
custom, and only by a special command of
the senate. 4. Previous to the institution
of the censorship the consuls had to perform
all the functions which afterwards belonged
to the censors: they were accordingly the
highest officers of finance, held the census,
drew up the lists of the senators, equites, &amp;c.
After the establishment of the censorship they
still retained the general superintendence of
the public economy, inasmuch as they had
the keys of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aerarium</i>, and as the quaestors
or paymasters were dependent on them.
But still in the management of the finances
the consuls were at all times under the control
of the senate. 5. In all relations with
foreign states the consuls were the representatives
of the Roman republic. Hence they
might conclude peace or treaties with foreign
nations, which had, however, to be sanctioned
by the senate and people at Rome;
and unless this sanction was obtained a treaty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
was void. They received foreign ambassadors,
and introduced them into the senate,
and in short all negotiations with foreign
princes or nations passed through their
hands. 6. In matters connected with their
own official functions, the consuls, like all
other magistrates, had the power of issuing
proclamations or orders (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edicta</i>), which might
be binding either for the occasion only, or
remain in force permanently.&mdash;Although the
consular power had been gradually diminished,
it was in cases of imminent danger
restored to its original and full extent, by a
decree of the senate calling upon the consuls
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">videant ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat</i>.
In such cases the consuls received sovereign
power, but they were responsible for the
manner in which they had exercised it.&mdash;It
has already been observed, that to avoid collision
and confusion, the two consuls did not
possess the same power at the same time, but
that each had the imperium every other
month. The one who possessed it, as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consul major</i>, exercised all the rights of the
office, though he always consulted his colleague.
In the earliest times it was customary
for the elder of the two consuls to take
the imperium first, afterwards the one who
had had the greater number of votes at the
election, and had therefore been proclaimed
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">renuntiare</i>) first. In the time of Augustus
it was enacted that the consul who had most
children should take precedence of the other;
and some distinction of rank continued to be
observed down to the latest times of the empire.&mdash;Towards
the end of the republic the
consulship lost its power and importance.
The first severe blow it received was from
Julius Caesar, the dictator, for he received
the consulship in addition to his dictatorship,
or he arbitrarily ordered others to be elected,
who were mere nominal officers, and were
allowed to do nothing without his sanction.
He himself was elected consul at first for five,
then for ten years, and at last for life. Under
Augustus the consulship was a mere shadow of
what it had been: the consuls no longer held
their office for a whole year, but usually for a
few months only; and hence it happened
that sometimes one year saw six, twelve, or
even twenty-five consuls. Those who were
elected the first in the year ranked higher
than the rest, and their names alone were
used to mark the year, according to the ancient
custom of the Romans of marking the
date of an event by the names of the consuls
of the year in which the event occurred.
During the last period of the empire it became
the practice to have titular or honorary
consuls, who were elected by the senate
and confirmed by the emperor. Constantine
appointed two consuls, one for Rome and
another for Constantinople, who held their
office for a whole year, and whose functions
were only those of chief justices. All the
other consuls were designated as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">honorarii</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consulares</i>. But though the consulship had
thus become almost an empty title, it was
still regarded as the highest dignity in the
empire, and as the object of the greatest ambition.
It was connected with very great
expenses, partly on account of the public
games which a consul had to provide, and
partly on account of the large donations he
had to make to the people. The last consul
at Rome was Decimus Theodorus Paulinus,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 536, and at Constantinople, Flavius Basilius
junior, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 541.</p>


<p id="Consularis">CONSŬLARIS, signified, under the republic,
a person who had held the office of
consul; but under the empire, it was the
title of many magistrates and public officers,
who enjoyed the insignia of consular dignity,
without having filled the office of consul.
Thus we find commanders of armies and governors
of provinces called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Consulares</i> under
the empire.</p>


<p id="Contio">CONTĬO, a contraction for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conventio</i>, that
is, a meeting, or a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conventus</i>. In the technical
sense, however, a contio was an assembly
of the people at Rome convened by a
magistrate for the purpose of making the
people acquainted with measures which were
to be brought before the next comitia, and of
working upon them either to support or oppose
the measure. But no question of any
kind could be decided by a contio, and this
constitutes the difference between contiones
and comitia. Still contiones were also
convened for other purposes, <em>e.g.</em> of persuading
the people to take part in a war, or
of bringing complaints against a party in the
republic. Every magistrate had the right to
convene contiones, but it was most frequently
exercised by the consuls and tribunes, and
the latter more especially exercised a great
influence over the people in and through these
contiones. A magistrate who was higher in
rank than the one who had convened a contio,
had the right to order the people to disperse,
if he disapproved of the object. It should be
remarked, that the term contio is also used
to designate the speeches and harangues addressed
to the people in an assembly, and
that in a loose mode of speaking, contio denotes
any assembly of the people.</p>


<p id="Contubernales">CONTŬBERNĀLES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύσκηνοι</span>), signified
originally men who served in the same army
and lived in the same tent. The word is derived
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taberna</i> (afterwards <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabernaculum</i>),
which was the original name for a
military tent, as it was made of boards (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Each tent was occupied by ten soldiers
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contubernales</i>), with a subordinate
officer at their head, who was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decanus</i>,
and in later times <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput contubernii</i>. Young
Romans of illustrious families used to accompany
a distinguished general on his expeditions,
or to his province, for the purpose of
gaining under his superintendence a practical
training in the art of war, or in the administration
of public affairs, and were, like soldiers
living in the same tent, called his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contubernales</i>.
In a still wider sense, the name
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contubernales</i> was applied to persons connected
by ties of intimate friendship, and
living under the same roof; and hence, when
a freeman and a slave, or two slaves, who
were not allowed to contract a legal marriage,
lived together as husband and wife,
they were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contubernales</i>; and their
connection, as well as their place of residence,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contubernium</i>.</p>

<p id="Conventus">CONVENTUS, was the name applied to
the whole body of Roman citizens who were
either permanently or for a time settled in a
province. In order to facilitate the administration
of justice, a province was divided into
a number of districts or circuits, each of which
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conventus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forum</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jurisdictio</i>.
Roman citizens living in a province were entirely
under the jurisdiction of the proconsul;
and at certain times of the year, fixed by the
proconsul, they assembled in the chief town
of the district, and this meeting bore the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conventus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνοδος</span>). Hence the expressions&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conventus
agere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peragere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">convocare</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dimittere</i>. At this conventus litigant
parties applied to the proconsul, who selected
a number of judges from the conventus to try
their causes. The proconsul himself presided
at the trials, and pronounced the sentence
according to the views of the judges,
who were his assessors (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consilium</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consiliarii</i>).
These conventus appear to have
been generally held after the proconsul had
settled the military affairs of the province; at
least, when Caesar was proconsul of Gaul, he
made it a regular practice to hold the conventus
after his armies had retired to their
winter quarters.</p>

<p id="Cophinus">CŎPHĬNUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόφινος</span>, Engl. <em>coffin</em>), a large
kind of wicker basket, made of willow
branches. It would seem that it was used
by the Greeks as a basket or cage for birds.
The Romans used it for agricultural purposes,
and it sometimes formed a kind of
portable hot-bed. Juvenal, when speaking
of the Jews, uses the expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cophinus et
foenum</i> (a truss of hay), figuratively to designate
their poverty.</p>


<p id="Corbis">CORBIS, <em>dim</em>. CORBŬLA, CORBĬCŬLA, a
basket of very peculiar form and common use
among the Romans, both for agricultural and
other purposes. It was made of osiers twisted
together, and was of a conical or pyramidal
shape. A basket answering precisely to this
description, both in form and material, is still
to be seen in every-day use among the Campanian
peasantry, which is called in the language
of the country “la corbella.”</p>


<p id="Corbitae">CORBĪTAE, merchantmen of the larger
class, so called because they hung out a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corbis</i> at the mast-head for a sign. They
were also termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">onerariae</i>; and hence Plautus,
in order to designate the voracious appetites
of some women, says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corbitam cibi
comesse possunt</span>.”</p>

<p id="Corona">CŎRŌNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στέφανος</span>), a crown, that is, a
circular ornament of metal, leaves, or flowers,
worn by the ancients round the head or neck,
and used as a festive as well as funereal decoration,
and as a reward of talent, military
or naval prowess, and civil worth. Its first
introduction as an honorary reward is attributable
to the athletic games, in some of
which it was bestowed as a prize upon the
victor. It was the only reward contended
for by the Spartans in their gymnic contests,
and was worn by them when going to battle.
The Romans refined upon the practice of the
Greeks, and invented a great variety of
crowns formed of different materials, each
with a separate appellation, and appropriated
to a particular purpose.&mdash;I. <span id="Corona_ob" class="smcap">Corona Obsidionalis.</span>
Amongst the honorary crowns
bestowed by the Romans for military achievements,
the most difficult of attainment, and
the one which conferred the highest honour,
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona obsidionalis</i>, presented by a
beleaguered army after its liberation to the
general who broke up the siege. It was
made of grass, or weeds and wild flowers,
thence called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona graminea</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">graminea
obsidionalis</i>, gathered from the spot on which
the beleaguered army had been enclosed.&mdash;II.
<span id="Corona_ci" class="smcap">Corona Civica</span>, the second in honour and
importance, was presented to the soldier who
had preserved the life of a Roman citizen in
battle. It was made of the leaves of the oak.
The soldier who had acquired this crown had
a place reserved next to the senate at all the
public spectacles; and they, as well as the
rest of the company, rose up upon his entrance.
He was freed from all public burthens,
as were also his father, and his paternal
grandfather; and the person who owed
his life to him was bound, ever after, to
cherish his preserver as a parent, and afford
him all such offices as were due from a son
to his father.&mdash;III. <span id="Corona_na" class="smcap">Corona Navalis</span> or <span id="Corona_ro" class="smcap">Rostrata</span>,
called also <span id="Corona_cl" class="smcap">Classica</span>. It is difficult to
determine whether these were two distinct
crowns, or only two denominations for the
same one. It seems probable that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">navalis
corona</i>, besides being a generic term, was
inferior in dignity to the latter, and given
to the sailor who first boarded an enemy’s
ship; whereas the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostrata</i> was given to a
commander who destroyed the whole fleet,
or gained any very signal victory. At all
events, they were both made of gold; and
one at least (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostrata</i>) decorated with the
beaks of ships like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostra</i> in the forum.
The Athenians likewise bestowed golden
crowns for naval services; sometimes upon
the person who got his trireme first equipped,
and at others upon the captain who had his
vessel in the best order.&mdash;IV. <span id="Corona_mu" class="smcap">Corona Muralis</span>,
was presented by the general to the
first man who scaled the wall of a besieged
city. It was made of gold, and decorated
with turrets.&mdash;V. <span id="Corona_ca" class="smcap">Corona Castrensis</span> or <span id="Corona_va" class="smcap">Vallaris</span>,
was presented to the first soldier who
surmounted the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallum</i>, and forced an entrance
into the enemy’s camp. This crown
was made of gold, and ornamented with the
palisades (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">valli</i>) used in forming an entrenchment.&mdash;VI.
<span id="Corona_tr" class="smcap">Corona Triumphalis.</span> There
were three sorts of triumphal crowns: the
first was made of laurel or bay leaves, and
was worn round the head of the commander
during his triumph; the second was of gold,
which, being too large and massive to be
worn, was held over the head of the general
during his triumph, by a public officer. This
crown, as well as the former one, was presented
to the victorious general by his army.
The third kind, likewise of gold and of great
value, was sent as a present from the provinces
to the commander. [<span id="Corona_au" class="smcap">Aurum Coronarium.</span>]&mdash;VII.
<span id="Corona_ov" class="smcap">Corona Ovalis</span>, was given to
a commander who obtained only an ovation.
It was made of myrtle.&mdash;VIII. <span id="Corona_ol" class="smcap">Corona Oleagina</span>,
was made of the olive leaf, and conferred
upon the soldiers as well as their commanders.&mdash;The
Greeks in general made but
little use of crowns as rewards of valour in
the earlier periods of their history, except as
prizes in the athletic contests; but previous
to the time of Alexander, crowns of gold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
were profusely distributed, amongst the
Athenians at least, for every trifling feat,
whether civil, naval, or military, which,
though lavished without much discrimination
as far as regards the character of the receiving
parties, were still subjected to certain
legal restrictions in respect of the time, place,
and mode in which they were conferred.
They could not be presented but in the public
assemblies, and with the consent, that is by
suffrage, of the people, or by the senators in
their council, or by the tribes to their own
members, or by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημόται</span> to members of
their own <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</span>. According to the statement
of Aeschines, the people could not lawfully
present crowns in any place except in their
assembly, nor the senators except in the senate-house;
nor, according to the same authority,
in the theatre, which is, however,
denied by Demosthenes; nor at the public
games, and if any crier there proclaimed the
crowns he was subject to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimia</i>. Neither
could any person holding an office receive a
crown whilst he was <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπεύθυνος</span>, that is, before
he had passed his accounts.&mdash;The second
class of crowns were emblematical and not
honorary, and the adoption of them was not
regulated by law, but custom. Of these there
were also several kinds.&mdash;I. <span id="Corona_sa" class="smcap">Corona Sacerdotalis</span>,
was worn by the priests (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacerdotes</i>),
with the exception of the pontifex maximus
and his minister (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">camillus</i>), as well as the
bystanders, when officiating at the sacrifice.
It does not appear to have been confined to
any one material.&mdash;II. <span id="Corona_fu" class="smcap">Corona Funebris</span> and
<span id="Corona_se" class="smcap">Sepulchralis</span>. The Greeks first set the example
of crowning the dead with chaplets of
leaves and flowers, which was imitated by
the Romans. Garlands of flowers were also
placed upon the bier, or scattered from the
windows under which the procession passed,
or entwined about the cinerary urn, or as a
decoration to the tomb. In Greece these
crowns were commonly made of parsley.&mdash;III.
<span id="Corona_co" class="smcap">Corona Convivialis.</span> The use of chaplets
at festive entertainments sprung likewise
from Greece. They were of various shrubs
and flowers, such as roses (which were the
choicest), violets, myrtle, ivy, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">philyra</i>, and
even parsley.&mdash;IV. <span id="Corona_nu" class="smcap">Corona Nuptialis.</span> The
bridal wreath was also of Greek origin, among
whom it was made of flowers plucked by the
bride herself, and not bought, which was of ill
omen. Amongst the Romans it was made of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbena</i>, also gathered by the bride herself,
and worn under the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flammeum</i>, with which
the bride was always enveloped. The bridegroom
also wore a chaplet. The doors of
his house were likewise decorated with garlands,
and also the bridal couch.&mdash;V. <span id="Corona_nt" class="smcap">Corona
Natalitia</span>, the chaplet suspended over the door
of the vestibule, both in the houses of Athens
and Rome, in which a child was born. At
Athens, when the infant was male, the crown
was made of olive; when female, of wool. At
Rome it was of laurel, ivy, or parsley.</p>

<p id="Coronis">CŎRŌNIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορωνίς</span>), the cornice of an entablature,
is properly a Greek word signifying

<p id="Cortina">CORTĪNA, the name of the table or hollow
slab, supported by a tripod, upon which the
priestess at Delphi sat to deliver her responses;
and hence the word is used for the
oracle itself. The Romans made tables of
marble or bronze after the pattern of the
Delphian tripod, which they used as we do
our sideboards, for the purpose of displaying
their plate at an entertainment. These were
termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cortinae Delphicae</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delphicae</i> simply.</p>


<p id="Corybantica">CŎRỸBANTĬCA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορυβαντικά</span>), a festival

<p id="Corvus">CORVUS, a sort of crane, used by C. Duilius
against the Carthaginian fleet in the
battle fought off Mylae, in Sicily (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 260).
The Romans, we are told, being unused to
the sea, saw that their only chance of victory
was by bringing a sea-fight to resemble
one on land. For this purpose they invented
a machine, of which Polybius has left a minute
description. In the fore part of the
ship a round pole was fixed perpendicularly,
twenty-four feet in height and about nine
inches in diameter; at the top of this was a
pivot, upon which a ladder was set, thirty-six
feet in length and four in breadth. The
ladder was guarded by cross-beams, fastened
to the upright pole by a ring of wood, which
turned with the pivot above. Along the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
ladder a rope was passed, one end of which
took hold of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corvus</i> by means of a ring.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corvus</i> itself was a strong piece of iron,
with a spike at the end, which was raised or
lowered by drawing in or letting out the
rope. When an enemy’s ship drew near, the
machine was turned outwards, by means of
the pivot, in the direction of the assailant.
Another part of the machine was a breast-work,
let down from the ladder, and serving
as a bridge, on which to board the enemy’s
vessel. By means of these cranes the Carthaginian
ships were either broken or closely
locked with the Roman, and Duilius gained a
complete victory.</p>

<p id="Cosmi">COSMI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοσμοί</span>), the supreme magistrates
in Crete, were ten in number, and were
chosen, not from the body of the people, but
from certain <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένη</span> or houses, which were probably
of more pure Doric or Achaean descent
than their neighbours. The first of them in
rank was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">protocosmus</i>, and gave his
name to the year. They commanded in war,
and also conducted the business of the state
with the representatives and ambassadors of
other cities. Their period of office was a year;
but any of them during that time might resign,
and was also liable to deposition by his colleagues.
In some cases, too, they might be
indicted for neglect of their duties. On the
whole, we may conclude that they formed the
executive and chief power in most of the
cities of Crete.</p>

</div>

<p id="Cothurnus">CŎTHURNUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόθορνος</span>), a boot. Its essential
distinction was its height; it rose
above the middle of the leg, so as to surround
the calf, and sometimes it reached as high as
the knees. It was worn principally by horsemen,
by hunters, and by men of rank and
authority. The sole of the cothurnus was
commonly of the ordinary thickness; but it
was sometimes made much thicker than usual,
probably by the insertion of slices of cork.
The object was, to add to the apparent stature
of the wearer; and this was done in the case
of the actors in Athenian tragedy, who had
the soles made unusually thick as one of the
methods adopted in order to magnify their
whole appearance. Hence tragedy in general
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cothurnus</i>. As the cothurnus was
commonly worn in hunting, it is represented
as part of the costume of Artemis (Diana).</p>


<p id="Cottabus">COTTĂBUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κότταβος</span>), a social game which
was introduced from Sicily into Greece, where
it became one of the favourite amusements of
young people after their repasts. The simplest
way in which it originally was played
was this:&mdash;One of the company threw out of
a goblet a certain quantity of wine, at a certain
distance, into a metal basin. While he
was doing this, he either thought of or pronounced
the name of his mistress; and if all
the wine fell in the basin, and with a full
sound, it was a good sign for the lover. This
simple amusement soon assumed a variety of
different characters, and became, in some
instances, a regular contest, with prizes for
the victor. One of the most celebrated modes
in which it was carried on is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δι’ ὀξυβάφων</span>.
A basin was filled with water, with
small empty cups (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀξύβαφα</span>) swimming upon
it. Into these the young men, one after
another, threw the remnant of the wine from
their goblets, and he who had the good fortune
to drown most of the bowls obtained the
prize, consisting either of simple cakes, sweetmeats,
or sesame-cakes.</p>


<p id="Cotyttia">CŎTYTTĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοττύτια</span>), a festival which was
originally celebrated by the Edonians of
Thrace, in honour of a goddess called Cotys,
or Cotytto. It was held at night. The worship
of Cotys, together with the festival of
the Cotyttia, was adopted by several Greek
states, chiefly those which were induced by
their commercial interest to maintain friendly
relations with Thrace. The festivals of this
goddess were notorious among the ancients
for the dissolute manner and the debaucheries
with which they were celebrated.</p>


<p id="Cotyla">CŎTỸLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοτύλη</span>), a measure of capacity
among the Romans and Greeks: by the former
it was also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hemina</i>; by the latter,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρυβλίον</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμίνα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμίμνα</span>. It was the
half of the sextarius or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξέστης</span>, and contained
6 cyathi, or nearly half a pint English.</p>


<p id="Covinus">CŎVĪNUS (Celtic, <em>kowain</em>), a kind of car,
the spokes of which were armed with long
sickles, and which was used as a scythe-chariot
chiefly by the ancient Belgians and
Britons. The Romans designated, by the
name of covinus, a kind of travelling carriage,
which seems to have been covered on all sides
with the exception of the front. It had no
seat for a driver, but was conducted by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
traveller himself, who sat inside. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">covinarii</i>
(this word occurs only in Tacitus) seem
to have constituted a regular and distinct part
of a British army. Compare <span class="smcap"><a href="#Esseda">Essedum</a></span>.</p>


<p id="Crater">CRĀTER (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρατήρ</span>, Ionic <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρητήρ</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεράννυμι</span>,
I mix), a vessel in which the wine, according
to the custom of the ancients, who
very seldom drank it pure, was mixed with
water, and from which the cups were filled.
Craters were among the first things on the
embellishment of which the ancient artists
exercised their skill; and the number of
craters dedicated in temples seems everywhere
to have been very great.</p>


<p id="Crepida">CRĔPĬDA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρηπίς</span>), a slipper. Slippers
were worn with the pallium, not with the toga,
and were properly characteristic of the Greeks,
though adopted from them by the Romans.</p>


<p id="Crimen">CRĪMEN. Though this word occurs so
frequently, it is not easy to fix its meaning.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crimen</i> is often equivalent to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accusatio</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατηγορία</span>);
but it frequently means an act which
is legally punishable. Those delicta which
were punishable according to special leges,
senatus consulta, and constitutiones, and were
prosecuted in judicia publica by an accusatio
publica, were more especially called crimina;
and the penalties in case of conviction were
loss of life, of freedom, of civitas, and the
consequent infamia, and sometimes pecuniary
penalties also.</p>


<p id="Crista">CRISTA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Galea">Galea</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Crites">CRĬTES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κριτής</span>), a judge, was the name
applied by the Greeks to any person who did
not judge of a thing like a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δικαστής</span>, according
to positive laws, but according to his own
sense of justice and equity. But at Athens
a number of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κριταί</span> was chosen by ballot from
a number of selected candidates at every
celebration of the Dionysia: they were called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ κριταί, κατ’ ἐξοχήν</span>. Their office was to
judge of the merit of the different choruses
and dramatic poems, and to award the prizes
to the victors. Their number was five for
comedy and the same number for tragedy,
one being taken from every tribe.</p>


<p id="Crobylus">CRŌBỸLUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Coma">Coma</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Crocota">CRŎCŌTA (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestis</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κροκωτὸν</span> sc. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον</span>,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κροκωτὸς</span> sc. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χιτών</span>), was a kind of gala-dress,
chiefly worn by women on solemn
occasions, and in Greece especially, at the
festival of the Dionysia. Its name was derived
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crocus</i>, one of the favourite colours
of the Greek ladies.</p>

<p id="Crux">CRUX (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σταυρός</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκόλοψ</span>), an instrument of
capital punishment, used by several ancient
nations, especially the Romans and Carthaginians.
Crucifixion was of two kinds, the
less usual sort being rather impalement than
what we should describe by the word crucifixion,
as the criminal was transfixed by a
pole, which passed through the back and
spine and came out at the mouth. The cross
was of several kinds; one in the shape of an
X, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crux Andreana</i>, because tradition
reports St. Andrew to have suffered upon it;
another was formed like a T. The third, and
most common sort, was made of two pieces of
wood crossed, so as to make four right angles.
It was on this, according to the unanimous
testimony of the fathers, that our Saviour
suffered. The punishment, as is well known,
was chiefly inflicted on slaves, and the worst
kind of malefactors. The criminal, after sentence
pronounced, carried his cross to the
place of execution; a custom mentioned in
the Gospels. Scourging appears to have
formed a part of this, as of other capital
punishments among the Romans; but the
scourging of our Saviour is not to be regarded
in this light, for it was inflicted before sentence
was pronounced. The criminal was
next stripped of his clothes and nailed or
bound to the cross. The latter was the more
painful method, as the sufferer was left to die
of hunger. Instances are recorded of persons
who survived nine days. It was usual to
leave the body on the cross after death. The
breaking of the legs of the thieves, mentioned
in the Gospels, was accidental; because, by
the Jewish law, it is expressly remarked, the
bodies could not remain on the cross during
the Sabbath-day.</p>


<p id="Crypta">CRYPTA (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρύπτειν</span>, to conceal), a
crypt. Amongst the Romans, any long narrow
vault, whether wholly or partially below
the level of the earth, is expressed by this
term. The specific senses of the word are:&mdash;(1)
A covered portico or arcade; called more
definitely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crypto-porticus</i>, because it was not
supported by open columns like the ordinary
portico, but closed at the sides, with windows
only for the admission of light and air.&mdash;(2)
A grotto, particularly one open at both extremities,
forming what in modern language
is denominated a “tunnel.” A subterranean
vault used for any secret worship was also
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crypta</i>.&mdash;(3) When the practice of
consuming the body by fire was relinquished
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a></span>], and a number of bodies was consigned
to one place of burial, as the catacombs
for instance, this common tomb was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crypta</i>.</p>


<p id="Crypteia">CRYPTEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρυπτεία</span>), the name of an
atrocious practice at Sparta, said to have been
introduced by Lycurgus. The following is
the description given of the crypteia. The
ephors, at intervals, selected from among the
young Spartans, those who appeared to be
best qualified for the task, and sent them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
various directions all over the country, provided
with daggers and their necessary food.
During the day-time, these young men concealed
themselves; but at night they broke
forth into the high-roads, and massacred those
of the helots whom they met, or whom they
thought proper.</p>


<p id="Cubicularii">CŬBĬCŬLĀRĬI, slaves who had the care
of the sleeping and dwelling rooms. Faithful
slaves were always selected for this office, as
they had, to a certain extent, the care of their
master’s person. It was the duty of the cubicularii
to introduce visitors to their master.</p>


<p id="Cubiculum">CŬBĬCŬLUM usually means a sleeping and
dwelling room in a Roman house [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Domus">Domus</a></span>],
but it is also applied to the pavilion or tent
in which the Roman emperors were accustomed
to witness the public games. It appears
to have been so called, because the
emperors were accustomed to recline in the
cubicula, instead of sitting, as was anciently
the practice, in a sella curulis.</p>


<p id="Cubitus">CŬBĬTUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πῆχυς</span>), a Greek and Roman
measure of length, originally the length of
the human arm from the elbow to the wrist,
or to the knuckle of the middle finger. It
was equal to a foot and a half, which gives
1 foot 5·4744 inches Eng. for the Roman, and
1 foot 6·2016 inches for the Greek cubit.</p>


<p id="Cucullus">CŬCULLUS, a cowl. As the cowl was
intended to be used in the open air, and to
be drawn over the head to protect it from the
injuries of the weather, instead of a hat or
cap, it was attached only to garments of the
coarsest kind. The cucullus was also used
by persons in the higher circles of society,
when they wished to go abroad without being
known.</p>


<p id="Cudo">CŪDO or CŪDON, a skull-cap made of
leather or of the rough shaggy fur of any
wild animal, such as were worn by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velites</i>
of the Roman armies, and apparently synonymous
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">galerus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">galericulus</i>.</p>


<p id="Culeus">CŪLĔUS, or CULLĔUS, a Roman measure,
which was used for estimating the produce of
vineyards. It was the largest liquid measure
used by the Romans, containing 20 amphorae,
or 118 gallons, 7·546 pints.</p>

knife with only one edge, which formed a
straight line. The blade was pointed, and
its back curved. It was used for a variety
of purposes, but chiefly for killing animals
either in the slaughter-house, or in hunting,
or at the altars of the gods. The priest who
conducted a sacrifice never killed the victim
himself; but one of his ministri, appointed
for that purpose, who was called either by
the general name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minister</i>, or the more specific
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popa</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cultrarius</i>.</p>


<p id="Cultrarius">CULTRĀRĬUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Culter">Culter</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Cuneus">CŬNĔUS was the name applied to a body
of foot soldiers, drawn up in the form of a
wedge, for the purpose of breaking through
an enemy’s line. The common soldiers called
it a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput porcinum</i>, or pig’s head. The name
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cuneus</i> was also applied to the compartments
of seats in circular or semi-circular theatres,
which were so arranged as to converge to the
centre of the theatre, and diverge towards
the external walls of the building, with passages
between each compartment.</p>


<p id="Cuniculus">CŬNĪCŬLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπόνομος</span>), a mine or passage
underground, was so called from its
resemblance to the burrowing of a rabbit.
Fidenae and Veii are said to have been
taken by mines, which opened, one of them
into the citadel, the other into the temple of
Juno.</p>


<p id="Cupa">CŪPA, a wine-vat, a vessel very much
like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolium</i>, and used for the same purpose,
namely, to receive the fresh must, and
to contain it during the process of fermentation.
The inferior wines were drawn for
drinking from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cupa</i>, without being bottled
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amphorae</i>, and hence the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vinum
de cupa</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cupa</i> was either made of earthenware,
like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolium</i>, or of wood, and
covered with pitch. It was also used for
fruits and corn, forming rafts, and containing
combustibles in war, and even for a sarcophagus.</p>


<p id="Curator">CŪRĀTOR. Till a Roman youth attained
the age of puberty, which was generally fixed
at fourteen years of age, he was incapable of
any legal act, and was under the authority
of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tutor</i> or guardian; but with the attainment
of the age of puberty, he became capable
of performing every legal act, and was
freed from the control of his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tutor</i>. As,
however, a person of that tender age was
liable to be imposed upon, the lex Plaetoria
enacted that every person between the time
of puberty and twenty-five years of age should
be under the protection of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curator</i>. The
date of this lex is not known, though it is
certain that the law existed when Plautus
wrote (about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200), who speaks of it as
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex quina vicemaria</i>. This law established
a distinction of age, which was of great practical
importance, by forming the citizens into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
two classes, those above and those below
twenty-five years of age (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minores viginti
quinque annis</i>). A person under the last-mentioned
age was sometimes simply called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minor</i>. The object of the lex was to protect
persons under twenty-five years of age against
all fraud (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolus</i>). A person who wasted his
property (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prodigus</i>), and a person of unsound
mind (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">furiosus, demens</i>), were also placed
under the care of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curator</i>.</p>


<p id="Curatores">CŪRĀTŌRES were public officers of various
kinds under the Roman empire, such as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curatores annonae</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curatores ludorum</i>, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curatores regionum</i>, &amp;c.</p>


<p id="Curia">CŪRĬA, signifies both a division of the
Roman people and the place of assembly for
such a division. Each of the three ancient
Romulian tribes, the Ramnes, Tities, and
Luceres, was subdivided into 10 curiae, so
that the whole body of the populus or the
patricians was divided into 30 curiae. The
plebeians had no connection whatever with
the curiae. All the members of the different
gentes belonging to one curia were called, in
respect of one another, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiales</i>. The division
into curiae was of great political importance
in the earliest times of Rome, for
the curiae alone contained the citizens, and
their assembly alone was the legitimate representative
of the whole people. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Comitia_cu">Comitia
curiata</a>.</span>] Each curia as a corporation had
its peculiar sacra, and besides the gods of the
state, they worshipped other divinities and
with peculiar rites and ceremonies. For such
religious purposes each curia had its own
place of worship, called curia, in which the
curiales assembled for the purpose of discussing
political, financial, religious and other
matters. The religious affairs of each curia
were taken care of by a priest, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curio</i>, who
was assisted by another called curialis Flamen.
As there were 30 curiae, there were
likewise 30 curiones, who formed a college of
priests, presided over by one of them, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curio Maximus</i>. The 30 curiae had each its
distinct name, which are said to have been
derived from the names of the Sabine women
who had been carried off by the Romans,
though it is evident that some derived their
names from certain districts or from ancient
eponymous heroes. Curia is also used to designate
the place in which the senate held its
meetings, such as curia Hostilia, curia Julia,
curia Pompeii, and from this there gradually
arose the custom of calling the senate itself
in the Italian towns curia, but never the senate
of Rome. The official residence of the
Salii, which was dedicated to Mars, was likewise
styled curia.</p>

<p id="Curius">CŪRĬUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύριος</span>), signified generally at
Athens the person responsible for the welfare
of such members of a family as the law presumed
to be incapable of protecting themselves;
as, for instance, minors and slaves,
and women of all ages.</p>

  <div class="caption">Currus. (Ancient Chariot preserved in the Vatican.)</div>
</div>

<p id="Currus">CURRUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅρμα</span>), a chariot, a car. These
terms appear to have denoted those two-wheeled
vehicles for the carriage of persons,
which were open overhead, thus differing
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carpentum</i>, and closed in front, in
which they differed from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cisium</i>. The
most essential articles in the construction of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
the currus were, 1. The rim (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄντυξ</span>) [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Antyx">Antyx</a></span>].
2. The axle (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄξων</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">axis</i>). 3. The wheels
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύκλα, τροχοί</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rotae</i>), which revolved upon
the axle, and were prevented from coming
off by the insertion of pins (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμβολοι</span>) into the
extremities of the axles. The parts of the
wheel were:&mdash;(<em>a</em>) The nave (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλήμνη</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modiolus</i>).
(<em>b</em>) The spokes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κνῆμαι</span>, literally, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legs, radii</i>.) (<em>c</em>) The felly (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴτυς</span>). (<em>d</em>) The
tire (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίσωτρον</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canthus</i>). 4. The pole (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥυμός</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">temo</i>). All the parts above mentioned are
seen in the preceding cut of an ancient chariot.
The Greeks and Romans appear never to have
used more than one pole and one yoke, and
the currus thus constructed was commonly
drawn by two horses, which were attached to
it by their necks, and therefore called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίζυγες
ἵπποι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνωρίς</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gemini jugales</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equi bijuges</i>,
&amp;c. If a third horse was added, as was not
unfrequently the case, it was fastened by
traces. The horse so attached was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρήορος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παράσειρος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σειραφόρος</span>, in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funalis</i>,
and is opposed to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζυγῖται</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζύγιοι</span>,
the yoke-horses. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἵππος παρήορος</span> is placed
on the right of the two yoke-horses. (See
woodcut.) The Latin name for a chariot and
pair was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">biga</i>, generally <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bigae</i>. When a
third horse was added, it was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triga</i>.</p>

<p id="A">A chariot and four was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadriga</i>,
generally <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrigae</i>; in Greek, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετραορία</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέθριππος</span>. The horses were commonly
harnessed in a quadriga after the manner
already represented, the two strongest horses
being placed under the yoke, and the two
others fastened on each side by means of
ropes. This is clearly seen in the two quadrigae
figured below, especially in the one on
the right hand. It represents a chariot overthrown
in passing the goal at the circus. The
charioteer having fallen backwards, the pole
and yoke are thrown upwards into the air;
the two trace-horses have fallen on their
knees, and the two yoke-horses are prancing
on their hind legs.&mdash;The currus was adapted
to carry two persons, and on this account was
called in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίφρος</span>. One of the two was
of course the driver. He was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡνίοχος</span>,
because he held the reins, and his companion
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραβάτης</span>, from going by his side or near
him. In the Homeric ages, chariots were
commonly employed on the field of battle.
The men of rank all took their chariots with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
them, and in an engagement placed themselves
in front. Chariots were not much
used by the Romans. The most splendid
kind were the quadrigae, in which the Roman
generals and emperors rode when they
triumphed. The body of the triumphal car
was cylindrical, as we often see it represented
on medals. It was enriched with
gold and ivory. The utmost skill of the
painter and the sculptor was employed to
enhance its beauty and splendour. The
triumphal car had in general no pole, the
horses being led by men who were stationed
at their heads.</p>

<p id="Cyathus">CỸĂTHUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύαθος</span>), a Greek and Roman
liquid measure, containing one-twelfth of the
sextarius, or ·0825 of a pint English. The
form of the cyathus used at banquets was
that of a small ladle, by means of which the
wine was conveyed into the drinking-cups
from the large vessel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crater</i>) in which it was
mixed. Two of these cyathi are represented
in the preceding woodcut. The cyathus was
also the name given to a cup holding the same

There were two forms, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cyma recta</i>,

The word is derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύμβος</span>, a hollow.
The cymbal was a very ancient instrument,
being used in the worship of Cybelé, Bacchus,
Juno, and all the earlier deities of the Grecian
and Roman mythology. It probably
came from the East. The crotalum (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρόταλον</span>)
was a kind of cymbal. It appears to have
been a split reed or cane, which clattered
when shaken with the hand. Women who

those early works of art which were ascribed
to the age of Daedalus, and especially the
ancient wooden statues, ornamented with
gilding and bright colours and real drapery,
which were the earliest known forms of the

wood or stone, which were at first used for
symbols of them.</p>


<p id="Daedala_d">DAEDĂLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δαίδαλα</span>), the name of two

<p id="Decaduchi">DĔCĂDŪCHI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκαδοῦχοι</span>), the members
of a council of Ten, who succeeded the Thirty
in the supreme power at Athens, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 403.
They were chosen from the ten tribes, one
from each; but, though opposed to the
Thirty, they sent ambassadors to Sparta to
ask for assistance against Thrasybulus and
the exiles. They remained masters of Athens
till the party of Thrasybulus obtained possession
of the city and the democracy was restored.</p>

in many of the Grecian cities by the Lacedaemonians,
who entrusted to it the whole
government of the state under the direction
of a Spartan harmost. It always consisted
of the leading members of the aristocratical
party.</p>


<p id="Decasmus">DĔCASMUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκασμός</span>), bribery. There
were two actions for bribery at Athens: one,
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκασμοῦ γραφή</span>, lay against the person
who gave the bribe; and the other, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δώρων</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δωροδοκίας γραφή</span>, against the person who
received it. These actions applied to the
bribery of citizens in the public assemblies
of the people (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνδεκάζειν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν</span>), of
the Heliaea or any of the courts of justice, of
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλή</span>, and of the public advocates. Actions
for bribery were under the jurisdiction
of the thesmothetae. The punishment on
conviction of the defendant was death, or
payment of ten times the value of the gift
received, to which the court might add a
further punishment (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστίμημα</span>).</p>

<p id="Decemviri">DĔCEMVĬRI, or the “ten-men,” the name
of various magistrates and functionaries at
Rome, of whom the most important were:&mdash;(1)
<span class="smcap">Decemviri Legibus Scribendis</span>, ten commissioners,
who were appointed to draw up
a code of laws. They were entrusted with
supreme power in the state, and all the other
magistracies were suspended. They entered
upon their office at the beginning of the year
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 451; and they discharged their duties
with diligence, and dispensed justice with
impartiality. Each administered the government
day by day in succession as during an
interregnum; and the fasces were only carried
before the one who presided for the
day. They drew up a body of laws, distributed
into ten sections; which, after being
approved of by the senate and the comitia,
were engraven on tables of metal, and set up
in the comitium. On the expiration of their
year of office, all parties were so well satisfied
with the manner in which they had discharged
their duties, that it was resolved to continue
the same form of government for another
year; more especially as some of the decemvirs
said that their work was not finished.
Ten new decemvirs were accordingly elected,
of whom App. Claudius alone belonged to the
former body. These magistrates framed
several new laws, which were approved of by
the centuries, and engraven on two additional
tables. They acted, however, in a most
tyrannical manner. Each was attended by
twelve lictors, who carried not the rods only,
but the axes, the emblem of sovereignty.
They made common cause with the patrician
party, and committed all kinds of outrages
upon the persons and property of the plebeians
and their families. When their year
of office expired they refused to resign or to
appoint successors. At length, the unjust
decision of App. Claudius, in the case of Virginia,
which led her father to kill her with his
own hands to save her from prostitution, occasioned
an insurrection of the people. The decemvirs
were in consequence obliged to resign
their office, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 449; after which the usual magistracies
were re-established. The ten tables
of the former, and the two tables of the latter
decemvirs, form together the laws of the
Twelve Tables, which were the groundwork
of the Roman laws. This, the first attempt
to make a code, remained also the only attempt
for near one thousand years, until the
legislation of Justinian.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Decemviri Litibus</span>
or <span class="smcap">Stlitibus Judicandis</span>, were magistrates
forming a court of justice, which took
cognizance of civil cases. The history as well
as the peculiar jurisdiction of this court during
the time of the republic is involved in
inextricable obscurity. In the time of Cicero
it still existed, and the proceedings in it took
place in the ancient form of the sacramentum.
Augustus transferred to these decemvirs the
presidency in the courts of the centumviri.
During the empire, this court had jurisdiction
in capital matters, which is expressly
stated in regard to the decemvirs.&mdash;(3) <span class="smcap">Decemviri
Sacris Faciundis</span>, sometimes called
simply <span class="smcap">Decemviri Sacrorum</span>, were the members
of an ecclesiastical collegium, and were
elected for life. Their chief duty was to take
care of the Sibylline books, and to inspect
them on all important occasions by command
of the senate. Under the kings the care of
the Sibylline books was committed to two
men (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duumviri</i>) of high rank. On the expulsion
of the kings, the care of these books was
entrusted to the noblest of the patricians, who
were exempted from all military and civil
duties. Their number was increased about
the year 367 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to ten, of whom five were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
chosen from the patricians and five from the
plebeians. Subsequently their number was
still further increased to fifteen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quindecemviri</i>),
probably by Sulla. It was also the
duty of the decemviri to celebrate the games
of Apollo, and the secular games.</p>


<p id="Decennalia">DĔCENNĀLĬA or DĔCENNĬA, a festival
celebrated with games every ten years by the
Roman emperors. This festival owed its
origin to the fact that Augustus refused the
supreme power when offered to him for his
life, and would only consent to accept it for
ten years, and when these expired, for
another period of ten years, and so on to the
end of his life.</p>


<p id="Decimatio">DĔCĬMĀTĬO, the selection, by lot, of every
tenth man for punishment, when any number
of soldiers in the Roman army had been
guilty of any crime. The remainder usually
had barley allowed to them instead of wheat.
This punishment appears not to have been
inflicted in the early times of the republic.</p>


<p id="Decretum">DĒCRĒTUM seems to mean that which is
determined in a particular case after examination
or consideration. It is sometimes
applied to a determination of the consuls, and
sometimes to a determination of the senate.
A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decretum</i> of the senate would seem to differ
from a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus-consultum</i>, in the way above
indicated: it was limited to the special occasion
and circumstances, and this would be
true whether the decretum was of a judicial
or a legislative character. But this distinction
in the use of the two words, as applied
to an act of the senate, was, perhaps, not
always observed.</p>


<p id="Decumae">DĔCŬMAE (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">partes</i>) formed a portion
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vectigalia</i> of the Romans, and were
paid by subjects whose territory, either by
conquest or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deditio</i>, had become the property
of the state (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ager publicus</i>). They consisted,
as the name denotes, of a tithe or tenth of
the produce of the soil, levied upon the cultivators
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aratores</i>) or occupiers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">possessores</i>) of
the lands, which, from being subject to this
payment, were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agri decumani</i>. The tax
of a tenth was, however, generally paid by corn
lands: plantations and vineyards, as requiring
no seed and less labour, paid a fifth of the
produce. A similar system existed in Greece
also. Peisistratus, for instance, imposed a
tax of a tenth on the lands of the Athenians,
which the Peisistratidae lowered to a twentieth.
At the time of the Persian war the
confederate Greeks made a vow, by which all
the states who had surrendered themselves to
the enemy were subjected to the payment of
tithes for the use of the god at Delphi. The
tithes of the public lands belonging to Athens
were farmed out as at Rome to contractors,
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκατώναι</span>: the term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκατηλόγοι</span> was
applied to the collectors; but the callings
were, as we might suppose, often united in
the same person. The title <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκατευταί</span> is applied
to both. A <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκάτη</span>, or tenth of a different
kind, was the arbitrary exaction imposed
by the Athenians (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 410) on the cargoes
of all ships sailing into or out of the Pontus.
They lost it by the battle of Aegospotami
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 405); but it was re-established by
Thrasybulus about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 391. The tithe was
let out to farm.</p>

<p id="Delia">DĒLĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δήλια</span>), the name of festivals and
games celebrated in the island of Delos, to
which the Cyclades and the neighbouring Ionians
on the coasts belonged. The Delia had
existed from very early times, and were celebrated
every fifth year. That the Athenians
took part in these solemnities at a very early
period, is evident from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deliastae</i> (afterwards
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωροί</span>) mentioned in the laws of
Solon; the sacred vessel (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωρίς</span>), moreover,
which they sent to Delos every year, was
said to be the same which Theseus had sent
after his return from Crete. In the course
of time the celebration of this ancient panegyris
in Delos had ceased, and it was not revived
until <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 426, when the Athenians,
after having purified the island in the winter
of that year, restored the ancient solemnities,
and added horse-races, which had never
before taken place at the Delia. After this
restoration, Athens, being at the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Ionian confederacy, took the most prominent
part in the celebration of the Delia; and
though the islanders, in common with Athens,
provided the choruses and victims, the leader
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιθέωρος</span>), who conducted the whole solemnity,
was an Athenian, and the Athenians
had the superintendence of the common sanctuary.
From these solemnities, belonging to
the great Delian panegyris, we must distinguish
the <em>lesser Delia</em>, which were mentioned
above, and which were celebrated
every year, probably on the 6th of Thargelion.
The Athenians on this occasion sent
the sacred vessel (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωρίς</span>), which the priest of
Apollo adorned with laurel branches, to Delos.
The embassy was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωρία</span>; and
those who sailed to the island, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωροί</span>; and
before they set sail a solemn sacrifice was
offered in the Delion, at Marathon, in order
to obtain a happy voyage. During the absence
of the vessel the city of Athens was purified,
and no criminal was allowed to be executed.</p>


<p id="Delphinia">DELPHĪNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δελφίνια</span>), a festival of the
same expiatory character as the Apollonia,
which was celebrated in various towns of
Greece, in honour of Apollo, surnamed Delphinius.</p>


<p id="Delphis">DELPHIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δελφίς</span>), an instrument of naval
warfare. It consisted of a large mass of iron
or lead suspended on a beam, which projected
from the mast of the ship like a yard-arm.
It was used to sink, or make a hole in,
an enemy’s vessel, by being dropped upon it
when alongside.</p>

the head-boroughs or chief magistrates of the

first appointed by Cleisthenes. Their duties
were various and important. Thus, they
convened meetings of the demus, and took
the votes upon all questions under consideration;
they made and kept a register of the
landed estates in their districts, levied the
monies due to the demus for rent, &amp;c. They

chief executive magistracy. We also read of

ranked next to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strategi</i>, and put questions
to the vote in the general assembly of the
confederates. Officers named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epidemiurgi</i>, or
upper demiurgi, were sent by the Corinthians
to manage the government of their
colony at Potidaea.</p>


<p id="Democratia">DĒMŎCRĂTĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημοκρατία</span>), that form of
constitution in which the sovereign political
power is in the hands of the demus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</span>)
or commonalty. In a passage of Herodotus
(iii. 80), the characteristics of a democracy
are specified to be&mdash;1. Equality of legal
rights (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰσονομίη</span>). 2. The appointment of
magistrates by lot. 3. The accountability of
all magistrates and officers. 4. The reference
of all public matters to the decision of the
community at large. Aristotle remarks&mdash;“The
following points are characteristic of a
democracy; that all magistrates should be
chosen out of the whole body of citizens;
that all should rule each, and each in turn
rule all; that either all magistracies, or those
not requiring experience and professional
knowledge, should be assigned by lot; that
there should be no property qualification, or
but a very small one, for filling any magistracy;
that the same man should not fill the
same office twice, or should fill offices but few
times, and but few offices, except in the case
of military commands; that all, or as many
as possible of the magistracies, should be of
brief duration; that all citizens should be
qualified to serve as dicasts; that the supreme
power in everything should reside in
the public assembly, and that no magistrate
should be entrusted with irresponsible power
except in very small matters.” It is somewhat
curious that neither in practice nor in
theory did the representative system attract
any attention among the Greeks. That diseased
form of a democracy, in which from
the practice of giving pay to the poorer citizens
for their attendance in the public assembly,
and from other causes, the predominant
party in the state came to be in fact the
lowest class of the citizens, was by later
writers termed an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ochlocracy</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀχλοκρατία</span>&mdash;the
dominion of the mob).</p>


<p id="Demosii">DĒMŎSĬI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημόσιοι</span>), public slaves at
Athens, who were purchased by the state.
The public slaves, most frequently mentioned,
formed the city guard; it was their
duty to preserve order in the public assembly,
and to remove any person whom the
prytaneis might order. They are generally
called bowmen (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοξόται</span>); or from the native
country of the majority, Scythians (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σκύθαι</span>);
and also Speusinians, from the name of the
person who first established the force. They
originally lived in tents in the market-place,
and afterwards upon the Areiopagus. Their
officers had the name of toxarchs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόξαρχοι</span>).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
Their number was at first 300, purchased
soon after the battle of Salamis, but was afterwards
increased to 1200.</p>


<p id="Demus">DĒMUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</span>), originally indicated a district
or tract of land; and in this meaning of
a country district, inhabited and under cultivation,
it is contrasted with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόλις</span>. When
Cleisthenes, at Athens, broke up the four
tribes of the old constitution, he substituted
in their place ten local tribes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλαὶ τοπικαί</span>),
each of which he subdivided into ten <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demi</i> or
country parishes, possessing each its principal
town; and in some one of these demi
were enrolled all the Athenian citizens resident
in Attica, with the exception, perhaps,
of those who were natives of Athens itself.
These subdivisions corresponded in some degree
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">naucrariae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναυκραρίαι</span>) of the old
tribes, and were originally one hundred in
number. These demi formed independent
corporations, and had each their several magistrates,
landed and other property, with a
common treasury. They had likewise their
respective convocations or “parish meetings,”
convened by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demarchi</i>, in which was
transacted the public business of the demus,
such as the leasing of its estates, the elections
of officers, the revision of the registers or
lists of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημόται</span>, and the admission of new
members. Independent of these bonds of
union, each demus seems to have had its
peculiar temples and religious worship.
There were likewise judges, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δικασταὶ
κατα δημους</span>, who decided cases where the matter
in dispute was of less value than ten
drachmae. Admission into a demus was necessary
before any individual could enter upon
his full rights and privileges as an Attic citizen.
The register of enrolment was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ληξιαρχικὸν
γραμματεῖον</span>.</p>


<p id="Denarius">DĒNĀRĬUS, the principal silver coin among
the Romans, was so called because it was
originally equal to ten asses; but on the reduction
of the weight of the as [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As">As</a></span>], it was
made equal to sixteen asses, except in military
pay, in which it was still reckoned as
equal to ten asses. The denarius was first
coined five years before the first Punic war,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 269. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Argentum">Argentum</a>.</span>] The average value
of the denarii coined at the end of the commonwealth
is about 8½<em>d.</em>, and those under
the empire about 7½<em>d.</em> If the denarius be
reckoned in value 8½<em>d.</em>, the other Roman
coins of silver will be of the following value:</p>

<p>Some denarii were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">serrati</i>, because

<p id="Diaetetae">DĬAETĒTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαιτηταί</span>), or arbitrators, at
Athens, were of two kinds; the one public

private, and chosen (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἱρετοί</span>) by the parties
who referred to them the decision of a disputed
point, instead of trying it before a court
of justice; the judgments of both, according
to Aristotle, being founded on equity rather
than law. The number of public arbitrators
seems to have been 40, four for each
tribe. Their jurisdiction was confined to civil
cases.</p>

<p id="Diamastigosis">DĬĂMASTĪGŌSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαμαστίγωσις</span>), a solemnity
performed at Sparta at the festival
of Artemis Orthia. Spartan youths were
scourged on the occasion at the altar of Artemis,
by persons appointed for the purpose,
until their blood gushed forth and covered
the altar. Many anecdotes are related of the
courage and intrepidity with which young
Spartans bore the lashes of the scourge; some
even died without uttering a murmur at their
sufferings, for to die under the strokes was
considered as honourable a death as that on
the field of battle.</p>


<p id="Diapsephisis">DĬĂPSĔPHĬSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαψήφισις</span>), a political
institution at Athens, the object of which was
to prevent aliens, or such as were the offspring
of an unlawful marriage, from assuming
the rights of citizens. By this method<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
a trial of spurious citizens was to be
held by the demotae, within whose deme intruders
were suspected to exist.</p>


<p id="Diasia">DĪĂSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διάσια</span>), a great festival celebrated
at Athens, without the walls of the city, in
honour of Zeus, surnamed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μειλίχιος</span>. The
whole people took part in it, and the wealthier
citizens offered victims, while the poorer
classes burnt such incense as their country
furnished. The diasia took place in the latter
half of the month of Anthesterion with
feasting and rejoicings, and was, like most
other festivals, accompanied by a fair.</p>


<p id="Dicastes">DĬCASTĒS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δικαστής</span>), the name of a judge,
or rather juryman, at Athens. The conditions
of his eligibility were, that he should
be a free citizen, in the enjoyment of his full
franchise (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιτιμία</span>), and not less than thirty
years of age, and of persons so qualified
6,000 were selected by lot for the service
of every year. Their appointment took place
annually under the conduct of the nine archons
and their official scribe; each of these
ten personages drew by lot the names of
600 persons of the tribe assigned to him;
the whole number so selected was again divided
by lot into ten sections of 500 each,
together with a supernumerary one, consisting
of 1000 persons, from among whom
the occasional deficiencies in the sections of
500 might be supplied. To each of the ten
sections one of the ten first letters of the
alphabet was appropriated as a distinguishing
mark, and a small tablet (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πινάκιον</span>), inscribed
with the letter of the section and the name
of the individual, was delivered as a certificate
of his appointment to each dicast. Before
proceeding to the exercise of his functions,
the dicast was obliged to swear the
official oath. This oath being taken, and the
divisions made as above mentioned, it remained
to assign the courts to the several
sections of dicasts in which they were to sit.
This was not, like the first, an appointment
intended to last during the year, but took
place under the conduct of the thesmothetae,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i>, every time that it was necessary to
impanel a number of dicasts. As soon as the
allotment had taken place, each dicast received
a staff, on which was painted the letter
and the colour of the court awarded him,
which might serve both as a ticket to procure
admittance, and also to distinguish him
from any loiterer that might endeavour
clandestinely to obtain a sitting after business
had begun. While in court, and probably
from the hand of the presiding magistrate
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡγέμων δικαστηρίου</span>), he received the
token or ticket that entitled him to receive
his fee (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δικαστικόν</span>). This payment is said to
have been first instituted by Pericles, and
was originally a single obolus; it was increased
by Cleon to thrice that amount about
the 88th Olympiad.</p>


<p id="Dice">DĬCĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη</span>), signifies generally any proceedings
at law by one party directly or mediately
against others. The object of all
such actions is to protect the body politic, or
one or more of its individual members, from
injury and aggression; a distinction which has
in most countries suggested the division of all
causes into two great classes, the public and
the private, and assigned to each its peculiar
form and treatment. At Athens the first of
these was implied by the terms public <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαι</span>,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγῶνες</span>, or still more peculiarly by
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφαί</span>; causes of the other class were
termed private <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαι</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγῶνες</span>, or simply <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαι</span>
in its limited sense. In a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη</span>, only the person
whose rights were alleged to be affected,
or the legal protector (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύριος</span>) of such person,
if a minor or otherwise incapable of appearing
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suo jure</i>, was permitted to institute
an action as plaintiff; in public causes, with
the exception of some few in which the person
injured or his family were peculiarly
bound and interested to act, any free citizen,
and sometimes, when the state was directly
attacked, almost any alien, was empowered
to do so. The court fees, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytaneia</i>,
were paid in private but not in public causes,
and a public prosecutor that compromised
the action with the defendant was in most
cases punished by a fine of a thousand drachmae
and a modified disfranchisement, while
there was no legal impediment at any period
of a private lawsuit to the reconciliation of
the litigant parties.&mdash;The proceedings in
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη</span> were commenced by a summons
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόσκλησις</span>) to the defendant to appear on a
certain day before the proper magistrate
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσαγωγεύς</span>), and there answer the charges
preferred against him. This summons was
often served by the plaintiff in person, accompanied
by one or two witnesses (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλητῆρες</span>),
whose names were endorsed upon the declaration
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λῆξις</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγκλημα</span>). Between the service
of the summons and appearance of the parties
before the magistrate, it is very probable that
the law prescribed the intervention of a period
of five days. If both parties appeared, the
proceedings commenced by the plaintiff putting
in his declaration, and at the same time
depositing his share of the court fees (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρυτανεῖα</span>),
which were trifling in amount, but
the non-payment of which was a fatal objection
to the further progress of a cause.
When these were paid, it became the duty of
the magistrate, if no manifest objection appeared
on the face of the declaration, to cause
it to be written out on a tablet, and exposed
for the inspection of the public on the wall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
or other place that served as the cause list of
his court. The magistrate then appointed a
day for the further proceedings of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anacrisis</i>
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Anacrisis">Anacrisis</a></span>]. If the plaintiff failed to
appear at the anacrisis, the suit, of course,
fell to the ground; if the defendant made
default, judgment passed against him. An
affidavit might at this, as well as at other
periods of the action, be made in behalf of a
person unable to attend upon the given day,
and this would, if allowed, have the effect of
postponing further proceedings (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπωμοσία</span>);
it might, however, be combated by a counter-affidavit,
to the effect that the alleged reason
was unfounded or otherwise insufficient (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνθυπωμοσία</span>);
and a question would arise upon
this point, the decision of which, when adverse
to the defendant, would render him
liable to the penalty of contumacy. The
plaintiff was in this case said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐρήμην ἑλεῖν</span>;
the defendant, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐρήμην ὀφλεῖν</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκην</span> being the
word omitted in both phrases. The anacrisis
began with the affidavit of the plaintiff (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προωμοσία</span>),
then followed the answer of the defendant
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντωμοσία</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιγραφή</span>), then the
parties produced their respective witnesses,
and reduced their evidence to writing, and
put in originals, or authenticated copies, of
all the records, deeds, and contracts that
might be useful in establishing their case, as
well as memoranda of offers and requisitions
then made by either side (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προκλήσεις</span>). The
whole of the documents were then, if the
cause took a straightforward course (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐθυδικία</span>),
enclosed on the last day of the anacrisis
in a casket (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐχῖνος</span>), which was sealed,
and entrusted to the custody of the presiding
magistrate, till it was produced and opened at
the trial. During the interval no alteration
in its contents was permitted, and accordingly
evidence that had been discovered after the
anacrisis was not producible at the trial.&mdash;In
some causes, the trial before the dicasts
was by law appointed to come on within a
given time; in such as were not provided for
by such regulations, we may suppose that it
would principally depend upon the leisure of
the magistrate. Upon the court being assembled,
the magistrate called on the cause, and
the plaintiff opened his case. At the commencement
of the speech, the proper officer
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἐφ’ ὕδωρ</span>) filled the clepsydra with water.
As long as the water flowed from this vessel
the orator was permitted to speak; if, however,
evidence was to be read by the officer
of the court, or a law recited, the water was
stopped till the speaker recommenced. The
quantity of water, or, in other words, the
length of the speeches, was different in different
causes. After the speeches of the advocates,
which were in general two on each
side, and the incidental reading of the documentary
and other evidence, the dicasts proceeded
to give their judgment by ballot.&mdash;When
the principal point at issue was decided
in favour of the plaintiff, there followed
in many cases a further discussion as to the
fine or punishment to be inflicted on the
defendant (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παθεῖν ἢ ἀποτῖσαι</span>). All actions
were divided into two classes,&mdash;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγῶνες ἀτίμητοι</span>,
<em>suits not to be assessed</em>, in which the fine,
or other penalty, was determined by the
laws; and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγῶνες τιμητοί</span>, <em>suits to be assessed</em>,
in which the penalty had to be fixed
by the judges. If the suit was an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγῶν
τιμητος</span>, the plaintiff generally mentioned
in the pleadings the punishment which he
considered the defendant deserved (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τίμημα</span>);
and the defendant was allowed to make a
counter-assessment (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιτιμᾶσθαι</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποτιμᾶσθαι</span>),
and to argue before the judges why
the assessment of the plaintiff ought to be
changed or mitigated. In certain causes,
which were determined by the laws, any of
the judges was allowed to propose an additional
assessment (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστίμημα</span>); the amount
of which, however, appears to have been
usually fixed by the laws. Thus, in certain
cases of theft, the additional penalty was
fixed at five days’ and nights’ imprisonment.
Upon judgment being given in a
private suit, the Athenian law left its execution
very much in the hands of the successful
party, who was empowered to seize the moveables
of his antagonist as a pledge for the
payment of the money, or institute an action
of ejectment (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξούλης</span>) against the refractory
debtor. The judgment of a court of dicasts
was in general decisive (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη αὐτοτελής</span>); but
upon certain occasions, as, for instance, when
a gross case of perjury or conspiracy could
be proved by the unsuccessful party to have
operated to his disadvantage, the cause, upon
the conviction of such conspirators or witnesses,
might be commenced <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i>.</p>


<p id="Dictator">DICTĀTOR, an extraordinary magistrate
at Rome. The name is of Latin origin, and
the office probably existed in many Latin
towns before it was introduced into Rome.
We find it in Lanuvium even in very late times.
At Rome this magistrate was originally called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister populi</i> and not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictator</i>, and in the
sacred books he was always designated by the
former name down to the latest times. On
the establishment of the Roman republic the
government of the state was entrusted to two
consuls, that the citizens might be the better
protected against the tyrannical exercise of
the supreme power. But it was soon felt
that circumstances might arise in which it
was of importance for the safety of the state
that the government should be vested in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
hands of a single person, who should possess
for a season absolute power, and from whose
decision there should be no appeal to any
other body. Thus it came to pass that in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 501, nine years after the expulsion of
the Tarquins, the dictatorship (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictatura</i>)
was instituted. By the original law respecting
the appointment of a dictator (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex de dictatore
creando</i>) no one was eligible for this
office unless he had previously been consul.
We find, however, a few instances in which
this law was not observed.&mdash;When a dictator
was considered necessary, the senate passed a
senatus consultum, that one of the consuls
should nominate (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicere</i>) a dictator; and
without a previous decree of the senate the
consuls had not the power of naming a dictator.
The nomination or proclamation of the
dictator was always made by the consul, probably
without any witnesses, between midnight
and morning, and with the observance
of the auspices (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">surgens</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oriens nocte silentio
dictatorem dicebat</i>). The technical word
for this nomination or proclamation was
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicere</i> (seldom <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">creare</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facere</i>). Originally
the dictator was of course a patrician. The
first plebeian dictator was C. Marcius Rutilus,
nominated in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 356 by the plebeian consul
M. Popillius Laenas. The reasons which
led to the appointment of a dictator, required
that there should be only one at a time. The
dictators that were appointed for carrying on
the business of the state were said to be nominated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rei gerundae causa</i>, or sometimes
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seditionis sedandae causa</i>; and upon them,
as well as upon the other magistrates, the
imperium was conferred by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Curiata</i>.
The dictatorship was limited to six months,
and no instances occur in which a person
held this office for a longer time, for the dictatorships
of Sulla and Caesar are of course
not to be taken into account. On the contrary,
though a dictator was appointed for
six months, he often resigned his office long
previously, immediately after he had dispatched
the business for which he had been
appointed. As soon as the dictator was nominated,
a kind of suspension took place with
respect to the consuls and all the other
magistrates, with the exception of the tribuni
plebis. The regular magistrates continued,
indeed, to discharge the duties of their
various offices under the dictator, but they
were no longer independent officers, but were
subject to the higher imperium of the dictator,
and obliged to obey his orders in every thing.
The superiority of the dictator’s power to
that of the consuls consisted chiefly in the
three following points&mdash;greater independence
of the senate, more extensive power of
punishment without any appeal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">provocatio</i>)
from their sentence to the people, and irresponsibility.
To these three points, must of
course be added that he was not fettered by a
colleague. We may naturally suppose that
the dictator would usually act in unison with
the senate; but it is expressly stated that in
many cases where the consuls required the
co-operation of the senate, the dictator could
act on his own responsibility. That there
was originally no appeal from the sentence of
the dictator is certain, and accordingly the
lictors bore the axes in the fasces before
them even in the city, as a symbol of their
absolute power over the lives of the citizens,
although by the Valerian law the axes had
disappeared from the fasces of the consuls.
Whether, however, the right of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">provocatio</i>
was afterwards given cannot be determined.
It was in consequence of the great and irresponsible
power possessed by the dictatorship,
that we find it frequently compared with the
regal dignity, from which it only differed in
being held for a limited time.&mdash;There were
however a few limits to the power of the
dictator. 1. The most important was that
which we have mentioned above, that the
period of his office was only six months. 2.
He had not power over the treasury, but
could only make use of the money which was
granted him by the senate. 3. He was not
allowed to leave Italy, since he might thus
easily become dangerous to the republic;
though the case of Atilius Calatinus in the
first Punic war forms an exception to this
rule. 4. He was not allowed to ride on
horseback at Rome, without previously obtaining
the permission of the people; a
regulation apparently capricious, but perhaps
adopted that he might not bear too great a
resemblance to the kings, who were accustomed
to ride.&mdash;The insignia of the dictator
were nearly the same as those of the kings in
earlier times; and of the consuls subsequently.
Instead however of having only
twelve lictors, as was the case with the consuls,
he was preceded by twenty-four bearing
the secures as well as the fasces. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sella
curulis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</i> also belonged to
the dictator.&mdash;The preceding account of the
dictatorship applies more particularly to the
dictator rei gerundae causa; but dictators
were also frequently appointed, especially
when the consuls were absent from the city,
to perform certain acts, which could not be
done by any inferior magistrate. These dictators
had little more than the name; and as
they were only appointed to discharge a particular
duty, they had to resign immediately
that duty was performed. The occasions on
which such dictators were appointed, were
principally:&mdash;1. For the purpose of holding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
the comitia for the elections (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitiorum habendorum
causa</i>). 2. For fixing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clavus
annalis</i> in the temple of Jupiter (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clavi figendi
causa</i>) in times of pestilence or civil discord,
because the law said that this ceremony was
to be performed by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetor maximus</i>, and
after the institution of the dictatorship the
latter was regarded as the highest magistracy
in the state. 3. For appointing holidays
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriarum constituendarum causa</i>) on the appearance
of prodigies, and for officiating at
the public games (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludorum faciendorum
causa</i>), the presidency of which belonged to
the consuls or praetors. 4. For holding
trials (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quaestionibus exercendis</i>.) 5. And on
one occasion, for filling up vacancies in the
senate (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legendo senatui</i>).&mdash;Along with the
dictator there was always a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister equitum</i>,
the nomination of whom was left to the
choice of the dictator, unless the senatus
consultum specified, as was sometimes the
case, the name of the person who was to be
appointed. The magister equitum had, like
the dictator, to receive the imperium by a
lex curiata. The dictator could not be without
a magister equitum, and, consequently,
if the latter died during the six months of
the dictatorship, another had to be nominated
in his stead. The magister equitum was
subject to the imperium of the dictator, but
in the absence of his superior he became his
representative, and exercised the same powers
as the dictator. The magister equitum was
originally, as his name imports, the commander
of the cavalry, while the dictator was
at the head of the legions, the infantry; and
the relation between them was in this respect
similar to that which subsisted between
the king and the tribunus celerum. Dictators
were only appointed so long as the Romans
had to carry on wars in Italy. A solitary
instance of the nomination of a dictator
for the purpose of carrying on war out of
Italy has been already mentioned. The last
dictator rei gerundae causa was M. Junius
Pera, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 216. From that time dictators
were frequently appointed for holding
the elections down to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 202, but after that
year the dictatorship disappears altogether.&mdash;After
a lapse of 120 years, Sulla caused himself
to be appointed dictator in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 82, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reipublicae
constituendae causa</i>, but neither his dictatorship
nor that of Caesar is to be compared
with the genuine office. Soon after Caesar’s
death the dictatorship was abolished for ever
by a lex proposed by the consul Antonius.
During the time, however, that the dictatorship
was in abeyance, a substitute was invented
for it, whenever the circumstances of
the republic required the adoption of extraordinary
measures, by the senate investing
the consuls with dictatorial power. This
was done by the well-known formula, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Videant</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dent operam consules, ne quid respublica
detrimenti capiat</i>.</p>


<p id="Dictynnia">DICTYNNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δικτύννια</span>), a festival with
sacrifices, celebrated at Cydonia in Crete, in
honour of Artemis, surnamed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δίκτυννα</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δικτύνναια</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκτυον</span>, a hunter’s net.</p>


<p id="Dies">DĬES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμέρα</span>), a day. The name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies</i> was
applied, like our word day, to the time during
which, according to the notions of the ancients,
the sun performed his course around
the earth, and this time they called the civil
day (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies civilis</i>, in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νυχθήμερον</span>, because
it included both night and day). The natural
day (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies naturalis</i>), or the time from the
rising to the setting of the sun, was likewise
designated by the name dies. The civil day
began with the Greeks at the setting of the
sun, and with the Romans at midnight. At
the time of the Homeric poems the natural
day was divided into three parts. The first,
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠώς</span>, began with sunrise, and comprehended
the whole space of time during which
light seemed to be increasing, <em>i.e.</em> till mid-day.
The second part was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέσον ἦμαρ</span>
or mid-day, during which the sun was
thought to stand still. The third part bore
the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δείλη</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δείελον ἦμαρ</span>, which derived
its name from the increased warmth of
the atmosphere. Among the Athenians the
first and last of the divisions made at the
time of Homer were afterwards subdivided
into two parts. The earlier part of the
morning was termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρωΐ</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρῲ τῆς ἡμέρας</span>:
the latter, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πληθούσης τῆς ἀγορᾶς</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περὶ
πλήθουσαν ἀγοράν</span>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέσον ἦμαρ</span> of Homer
was afterwards expressed by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεσημβρία</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέσον
ἡμέρας</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέση ἡμέρα</span>, and comprehended, as
before, the middle of the day, when the sun
seemed neither to rise nor to decline. The
two parts of the afternoon were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δείλη
πρωΐη</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρωΐα</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δείλη ὀψίη</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀψία</span>. This
division continued to be observed down to
the latest period of Grecian history, though
another more accurate division was introduced
at an early period; for Anaximander,
or, according to others, his disciple Anaximenes,
is said to have made the Greeks
acquainted with the use of the Babylonian
chronometer or sun-dial (called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόλος</span>, or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὡρολόγιον</span>), by means of which the natural
day was divided into twelve equal spaces of
time. The division of the day most generally
observed by the Romans, was that into
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tempus antemeridianum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pomeridianum</i>,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meridies</i> itself being only considered as a
point at which the one ended and the other
commenced. But as it was of importance
that this moment should be known, an especial
officer [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Accensus">Accensus</a></span>] was appointed, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
proclaimed the time of mid-day. The division
of the day into twelve equal spaces,
which were shorter in winter than in summer,
was first adopted when artificial means of
measuring time were introduced among the
Romans from Greece. This was about the
year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 291, when L. Papirius Cursor, after
the war with Pyrrhus in southern Italy,
brought to Rome an instrument called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solarium
horologium</i>, or simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solarium</i>. But
as the solarium had been made for a different
latitude, it showed the time at Rome very
incorrectly. Scipio Nasica, therefore, erected
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 159 a public clepsydra, which indicated
the hours of the night as well as of the
day. Even after the erection of this clepsydra
it was customary for one of the subordinate
officers of the praetor to proclaim the
third, sixth, and ninth hours; which shows
that the day was, like the night, divided into
four parts, each consisting of three hours.&mdash;All
the days of the year were, according to
different points of view, divided by the Romans
into different classes. <span id="Dies_f">For</span> the purpose
of the administration of justice all days were
divided into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies fasti</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies nefasti</i>. <span class="smcap">Dies
fasti</span> were the days on which the praetor
was allowed to administer justice in the public
courts; they derived their name from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fari</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fari tria verba</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">do</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dico</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">addico</i>). On
some of the dies fasti comitia could be held,
but not on all. The regular <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies fasti</i> were
marked in the Roman calendar by the letter
F, and their number in the course of the year
was 38.&mdash;Besides these there were certain
days called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies intercisi</i>, on which the praetor
might hold his courts, but not at all
hours, so that sometimes one half of such a
day was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fastus</i>, while the other half was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nefastus</i>.
Their number was 65 in the year.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dies
nefasti</span> were days on which neither
courts of justice nor comitia were allowed to
be held, and which were dedicated to other
purposes. The term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies nefasti</i>, which
originally had nothing to do with religion,
but simply indicated days on which no courts
were to be held, was in subsequent times
applied to religious days in general, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies
nefasti</i> were mostly dedicated to the worship
of the gods.&mdash;In a religious point of view all
days of the year were either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies festi</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies profesti</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies intercisi</i>. According to
the definition given by Macrobius, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies festi</i>
were dedicated to the gods, and spent with
sacrifices, repasts, games, and other solemnities;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies profesti</i> belonged to men for the
administration of their private and public
affairs. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dies intercisi</i> were common between
gods and men, that is, partly devoted to the
worship of the gods, partly to the transaction
of ordinary business. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dies profesti</i> were
either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies fasti</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies comitiales</i>, that is,
days on which comitia were held, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies
comperendini</i>, that is, days to which any action
was allowed to be transferred; or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies
stati</i>, that is, days set apart for causes
between Roman citizens and foreigners; or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies proeliales</i>, that is, all days on which religion
did not forbid the commencement of a
war.</p>

or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διπόλια</span>, a very ancient festival celebrated

by the Megarians in honour of an ancient
Athenian hero, Diocles, around whose grave
young men assembled on the occasion, and
amused themselves with gymnastic and other
contests. We read that he who gave the
sweetest kiss obtained the prize, consisting
of a garland of flowers.</p>


<p id="Dionysia">DĬŎNȲSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διονύσια</span>), festivals celebrated
in various parts of Greece in honour of Dionysus,
and characterised by extravagant
merriment and enthusiastic joy. Drunkenness,
and the boisterous music of flutes, cymbals,
and drums, were likewise common to
all Dionysiac festivals. In the processions
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θίασοι</span> (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θείαζω</span>), with which they
were celebrated, women also took part in the
disguise of Bacchae, Lenae, Thyades, Naiades,
Nymphs, &amp;c., adorned with garlands of ivy,
and bearing the thyrsus in their hands, so
that the whole train represented a population
inspired, and actuated by the powerful presence
of the god. The choruses sung on the
occasion were called dithyrambs, and were
hymns addressed to the god in the freest
metres and with the boldest imagery, in
which his exploits and achievements were
extolled. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a>.</span>] The phallus, the symbol
of the fertility of nature, was also carried
in these processions. The indulgence in
drinking was considered by the Greeks as a
duty of gratitude which they owed to the
giver of the vine; hence in some places it
was thought a crime to remain sober at the
Dionysia. The Attic festivals of Dionysus
were four in number: the <em>Rural</em> or <em>Lesser
Dionysia</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διονύσια κατ’ ἀγρούς</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μικρά</span>), the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lenaea</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λήναια</span>), the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthesteria</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀνθεστήρια</span>),
and the <em>City</em> or <em>Great Dionysia</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διονύσια ἐν ἄστει</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστικά</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεγάλα</span>). The
season of the year sacred to Dionysus was
during the months nearest to the shortest
day; and the Attic festivals were accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
celebrated in Poseideon, Gamelion, Anthesterion,
and Elaphebolion.&mdash;The <em>Rural</em> or
<em>Lesser Dionysia</em>, a vintage festival, were celebrated
in the various demes of Attica in the
month of Poseideon, and were under the superintendence
of the several local magistrates,
the demarchs. This was doubtless the most
ancient of all, and was held with the highest
degree of merriment and freedom; even
slaves enjoyed full freedom during its celebration,
and their boisterous shouts on the
occasion were almost intolerable. It is here
that we have to seek for the origin of comedy,
in the jests and the scurrilous abuse with which
the peasants assailed the bystanders from a
waggon in which they rode about. The Dionysia
in the Peiraeeus, as well as those of
the other demes of Attica, belonged to the
lesser Dionysia.&mdash;The second festival, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lenaea</i> (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ληνός</span>, the wine-press, from
which also the month of Gamelion was called
by the Ionians Lenaeon), was celebrated in
the month of Gamelion; the place of its celebration
was the ancient temple of Dionysus
Limnaeus (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λίμνη</span>, as the district was
originally a swamp). This temple was called
the Lenaeon. The Lenaea were celebrated
with a procession and scenic contests in tragedy
and comedy. The procession probably
went to the Lenaeon, where a goat (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τράγος</span>,
whence the chorus and tragedy which arose
out of it were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τραγικὸς χορός</span>, and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τραγῳδία</span>) was sacrificed, and a chorus standing
around the altar sang the dithyrambic
ode to the god. As the dithyramb was the
element out of which, by the introduction of
an actor, tragedy arose [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a></span>], it is natural
that, in the scenic contests of this festival,
tragedy should have preceded comedy. The
poet who wished his play to be brought out
at the Lenaea applied to the second archon,
who had the superintendence of this festival,
and who gave him a chorus if the piece was
thought to deserve it.&mdash;The third festival,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthesteria</i>, was celebrated on the 11th,
12th, and 13th days of the month of Anthesterion.
The second archon likewise superintended
the celebration of the Anthesteria,
and distributed the prizes among the victors
in the various games which were carried on
during the season. The first day was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πιθοιγία</span>: the second, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χόες</span>: and the third,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χύτροι</span>. The first day derived its name from
the opening of the casks to taste the wine of
the preceding year; the second from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χοῦς</span>,
the cup, and seems to have been the day
devoted to drinking. The third day had its
name from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χύτρος</span>, a pot, as on this day persons
offered pots with flowers, seeds, or cooked
vegetables, as a sacrifice to Dionysus and
Hermes Chthonius. It is uncertain whether
dramas were performed at the Anthesteria;
but it is supposed that comedies were represented,
and that tragedies which were to be
brought out at the great Dionysia were perhaps
rehearsed at the Anthesteria. The mysteries
connected with the celebration of the
Anthesteria were held at night.&mdash;The fourth
festival, the <em>City</em> or <em>Great Dionysia</em>, was
celebrated about the 12th of the month of
Elaphebolion; but we do not know whether
they lasted more than one day or not. The
order in which the solemnities took place was
as follows:&mdash;the great public procession, the
chorus of boys, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comus</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a></span>], comedy,
and, lastly, tragedy. Of the dramas which
were performed at the great Dionysia, the
tragedies at least were generally new pieces;
repetitions do not, however, seem to have
been excluded from any Dionysiac festival.
The first archon had the superintendence,
and gave the chorus to the dramatic poet who
wished to bring out his piece at this festival.
The prize awarded to the dramatist for the
best play consisted of a crown, and his name
was proclaimed in the theatre of Dionysus.
As the great Dionysia were celebrated at the
beginning of spring, when the navigation was
re-opened, Athens was not only visited by
numbers of country people, but also by
strangers from other parts of Greece, and the
various amusements and exhibitions on this
occasion were not unlike those of a modern
fair.&mdash;The worship of Dionysus, whom the
Romans called Bacchus, or rather the Bacchic
mysteries and orgies (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacchanalia</i>), are
said to have been introduced from southern
Italy into Etruria, and from thence to Rome,
where for a time they were carried on in
secret, and, during the latter period of their
existence, at night. The initiated, according
to Livy, not only indulged in feasting and
drinking at their meetings, but when their
minds were heated with wine they indulged in
the coarsest excesses and the most unnatural
vices. The time of initiation lasted ten days;
on the tenth, the person who was to be initiated
took a solemn meal, underwent a purification
by water, and was led into the sanctuary
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacchanal</i>). At first only women
were initiated, and the orgies were celebrated
every year during three days. But Pacula
Annia, a Campanian matron, pretending to
act under the direct influence of Bacchus,
changed the whole method of celebration:
she admitted men to the initiation, and transferred
the solemnisation, which had hitherto
taken place during the daytime, to the night.
Instead of three days in the year, she ordered
that the Bacchanalia should be held during
five days in every month. It was from that
time that these orgies were carried on with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
frightful licentiousness and excesses of every
kind. The evil at length became so alarming,
that, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 186, the consuls, by the command
of the senate, instituted an investigation
into the nature and object of these new
rites. The result was that numerous persons
were arrested, and some put to death; and
that a decree of the senate was issued, commanding
that no Bacchanalia should be held
either in Rome or Italy; that if any one
should think such ceremonies necessary, or if
he could not neglect them without scruples
or making atonements, he should apply to
the praetor urbanus, who might then consult
the senate. If the permission should be
granted to him in an assembly of the senate,
consisting of not less than one hundred members,
he might solemnise the Bacchic sacra;
but no more than five persons were to be
present at the celebration; there should be
no common fund, and no master of the sacra
or priest. A brazen table containing this
important document was discovered near
Bari, in southern Italy, in the year 1640,
and is at present in the imperial Museum of
Vienna. While the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bacchanalia</i> were thus
suppressed, another more simple and innocent
festival of Bacchus, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liberalia</i> (from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber Pater</i>, a name of Bacchus), continued
to be celebrated at Rome every year on the
16th of March. Priests and aged priestesses,
adorned with garlands of ivy, carried through
the city wine, honey, cakes, and sweetmeats,
together with an altar with a handle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ansata
ara</i>), in the middle of which there was a
small fire-pan (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foculus</i>), in which from time
to time sacrifices were burnt. On this day
Roman youths who had attained their sixteenth
year received the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga virilis</i>.</p>


<p id="Dioscuria">DĬŎSCŪRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διοσκούρια</span>), festivals celebrated
in various parts of Greece in honour
of the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux). Their
worship was very generally adopted in Greece,
especially in the Doric and Achaean states;
but little is known of the manner in which
their festivals were celebrated. At Athens

<p id="Divinatio">DĪVĪNĀTĬO (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαντική</span>), a power in man
which foresees future things by means of those
signs which the gods throw in his way.
Among the Greeks the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manteis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάντεις</span>), or
seers, who announced the future, were supposed
to be under the direct influence of the
gods, chiefly that of Apollo. In many families
of seers the inspired knowledge of the
future was considered to be hereditary, and
to be transmitted from father to son. To
these families belonged the Iamids, who from
Olympia spread over a considerable part of
Greece; the Branchidae, near Miletus; the
Eumolpids, at Athens and Eleusis; the Telliads,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the Acarnanian seers, and others. Along
with the seers we may also mention the Bacides
and the Sibyllae. Both existed from a
very remote time, and were distinct from the
manteis so far as they pretended to derive
their knowledge of the future from sacred
books (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρησμοί</span>) which they consulted, and
which were in some places, as at Athens and
Rome, kept by the government or some especial
officers, in the acropolis and in the
most revered sanctuary. The Bacides are
said to have been descended from one or
more prophetic nymphs of the name of Bacis.
The Sibyllae were prophetic women, probably
of Asiatic origin, whose peculiar custom
seems to have been to wander with their
sacred books from place to place. The Sibylla,
whose books gained so great an importance
at Rome, is reported to have been
the Erythraean: the books which she was
said to have sold to one of the Tarquins were
carefully concealed from the public, and only
accessible to the duumvirs. Besides these
more respectable prophets and prophetesses,
there were numbers of diviners of an inferior
order (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρησμολόγοι</span>), who made it their business
to explain all sorts of signs, and to tell
fortunes. They were, however, more particularly
popular with the lower orders, who
are everywhere most ready to believe what
is most marvellous and least entitled to credit.
No public undertaking of any consequence
was ever entered upon by the Greeks and
Romans without consulting the will of the
gods, by observing the signs which they
sent, especially those in the sacrifices offered
for the purpose, and by which they were
thought to indicate the success or the failure of
the undertaking. For this kind of divination
no divine inspiration was thought necessary,
but merely experience and a certain knowledge
acquired by routine; and although in
some cases priests were appointed for the
purpose of observing and explaining signs
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Augur">Augur</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Haruspices">Haruspex</a></span>], yet on any sudden
emergency, especially in private affairs, any
one who met with something extraordinary,
might act as his own interpreter. The principal
signs by which the gods were thought
to declare their will, were things connected
with the offering of sacrifices, the flight and
voice of birds, all kinds of natural phenomena,
ordinary as well as extraordinary, and
dreams.&mdash;The interpretation of signs of the
first class (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερομαντεία</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροσκοπία</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">haruspicium</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars haruspicina</i>) was, according to
Aeschylus, the invention of Prometheus. It
seems to have been most cultivated by the
Etruscans, among whom it was raised into a
complete science, and from whom it passed
to the Romans. Sacrifices were either offered
for the special purpose of consulting the gods,
or in the ordinary way; but in both cases
the signs were observed, and when they were
propitious, the sacrifice was said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλλιερεῖν</span>.
The principal points that were generally observed
were, 1. The manner in which the
victim approached the altar. 2. The nature
of the intestines with respect to their colour
and smoothness; the liver and bile were of
particular importance. 3. The nature of the
flame which consumed the sacrifice. Especial
care was also taken during a sacrifice, that
no inauspicious or frivolous words were uttered
by any of the bystanders: hence the
admonitions of the priests, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐφημεῖτε</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐφημία</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιγᾶτε, σιωπᾶτε</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">favete linguis</i>,
and others; for improper expressions were
not only thought to pollute and profane the
sacred act, but to be unlucky omens.&mdash;The
art of interpreting signs of the second class
was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰωνιστική</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">augurium</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicium</i>.
It was, like the former, common to Greeks
and Romans, but never attained the same
degree of importance in Greece as it did in
Rome. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Auspicium">Auspicium</a>.</span>] The Greeks, when
observing the flight of birds, turned their
face toward the north, and then a bird appearing
to the right (east), especially an
eagle, a heron, or a falcon, was a favourable
sign; while birds appearing to the left (west)
were considered as unlucky signs. Of greater
importance than the appearance of animals,
at least to the Greeks, were the phenomena
in the heavens, particularly during any public
transaction. Among the unlucky phenomena
in the heavens (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διοσημεῖα</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signa</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portenta</i>)
were thunder and lightning, an eclipse of the
sun or moon, earthquakes, rain of blood,
stones, milk, &amp;c. Any one of these signs
was sufficient at Athens to break up the assembly
of the people.&mdash;In common life, things
apparently of no importance, when occurring
at a critical moment, were thought by the
ancients to be signs sent by the gods, from
which conclusions might be drawn respecting
the future. Among these common occurrences
we may mention sneezing, twinkling
of the eyes, tinkling of the ears, &amp;c.&mdash;The
art of interpreting dreams (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀνειροπολία</span>), which
had probably been introduced into Europe
from Asia, where it is still a universal practice,
seems in the Homeric age to have been
held in high esteem, for dreams were said to
be sent by Zeus. In subsequent times, that
class of diviners who occupied themselves
with the interpretation of dreams, seems to
have been very numerous and popular; but
they never enjoyed any protection from the
state, and were chiefly resorted to by private
individuals.&mdash;The subject of oracles is treated
in a separate article. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Oraculum">Oraculum</a>.</span>]&mdash;The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divinatio</i> was used in a particular manner
by the Romans as a law term. If in any
case two or more accusers came forward
against one and the same individual, it was,
as the phrase ran, <em>decided by divination</em>, who
should be the chief or real accuser, whom the
others then joined as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subscriptores;</i> <em>i.e.</em> by
putting their names to the charge brought
against the offender. This transaction, by
which one of several accusers was selected to
conduct the accusation, was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divinatio</i>,
as the question here was not about facts, but
about something which was to be done, and
which could not be found out by witnesses or
written documents; so that the judices had,
as it were, to divine the course which they
had to take. Hence the oration of Cicero, in
which he tries to show that he, and not
Q. Caecilius Niger, ought to conduct the accusation
against Verres, is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Divinatio in
Caecilium</i>.</p>

<p id="Divortium">DĪVORTĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπόλειψις</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπόπεμψις</span>), divorce.
(1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span> The laws of Athens permitted
either the husband or the wife to call
for and effect a divorce. If it originated with
the wife, she was said to leave her husband’s
house (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπολείπειν</span>); if otherwise, to be dismissed
from it (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποπεμπέσθαι</span>). After divorce,
the wife resorted to her male relations, with
whom she would have remained if she had
never quitted her maiden state; and it then
became their duty to receive or recover from
her late husband all the property that she
had brought to him in acknowledged dowry
upon their marriage. If, upon this, both
parties were satisfied, the divorce was final
and complete: if otherwise, an action <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπολείψεως</span>,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποπέμψεως</span>, would be instituted, as
the case might be, by the party opposed to
the separation. A separation, however, whether
it originated from the husband or the
wife, was considered to reflect discredit on the
latter.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span> Divorce always existed
in the Roman polity. As one essential part
of a marriage was the consent and conjugal
affection of the parties, it was considered
that this affection was necessary to its
continuance, and accordingly either party
might declare his or her intention to dissolve
the connection. No judicial decree, and no
interference of any public authority, was
requisite to dissolve a marriage. The first
instance of divorce at Rome is said to have
occurred about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 234, when Sp. Carvilius
Ruga put away his wife, on the ground of
barrenness: it is added, that his conduct was
generally condemned. Towards the latter
part of the republic, and under the empire,
divorces became very common. Pompey divorced
his wife Mucia for alleged adultery;
and Cicero divorced his wife Terentia, after
living with her thirty years, and married a
young woman. Cato the younger divorced
his wife Marcia, that his friend Hortensius
might marry her, and have children by her;
for this is the true meaning of the story
that he lent his wife to Hortensius. If a
husband divorced his wife, the wife’s dowry,
as a general rule, was restored; and the
same was the case when the divorce took
place by mutual consent. Corresponding to
the forms of marriage by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">confarreatio</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coemtio</i>, there were the forms of divorce by
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diffarreatio</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">remancipatio</i>. In course of
time, less ceremony was used; but still some
distinct notice or declaration of intention was
necessary to constitute a divorce. The term
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repudium</i>, it is said, properly applies to a
marriage only contracted, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divortium</i> to an
actual marriage; but sometimes divortium
and repudium appear to be used indifferently.
The phrases to express a divorce are, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuntium
remittere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">divortium facere</i>; and the
form of words might be as follows&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tuas res
tibi habeto, tuas res tibi agito</i>. The phrases
used to express the renunciation of a marriage
contract were, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">renuntiare repudium</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repudium
remittere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicere</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repudiare</i>; and
the form of words might be, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conditione tua
non utor</i>.</p>


<p id="Docana">DŎCĂNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὰ δόκανα</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοκός</span>, a beam)

the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux), at Sparta.
It consisted of two upright beams with others
laid across them transversely.</p>


<p id="Docimasia">DŎCĬMĂSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοκιμασία</span>). When any citizen
of Athens was either appointed by lot,
or chosen by suffrage, to hold a public office,
he was obliged, before entering on its duties,
to submit to a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docimasia</i>, or scrutiny into his
previous life and conduct, in which any person
could object to him as unfit. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docimasia</i>,
however, was not confined to persons
appointed to public offices; for we read of
the denouncement of a scrutiny against orators
who spoke in the assembly while leading
profligate lives, or after having committed
flagitious crimes.</p>

variety of purposes in ancient as in modern
times. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtes</i> is an old Latin word for a
chisel, probably derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coelo</i>, to engrave.
Celts, or chisels, were frequently
employed in making entrenchments and in
destroying fortifications; and hence they are
often found in ancient earth-works and encampments.
They are for the most part of
bronze, more rarely of hard stone. The sizes
and forms which they present, are as various<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
as the uses to which they were applied. The

<p id="Dominium">DŎMĬNĬUM signifies quiritarian ownership,

dominus has the power of dealing with a

<p id="Domus">DŎMUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἶκος</span>), a house.&mdash;(1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span> A
Greek house was always divided into two
distinct portions, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Andronitis</i>, or men’s
apartments (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρωνῖτις</span>), and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gynaeconitis</i>,
or women’s apartments (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυναικωνῖτις</span>). In
the earliest times, as in the houses referred
to by Homer, and in some houses at a later
period, the women’s apartments were in the
upper story (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπερῷον</span>), but usually at a later
time the gynaeconitis was on the same story
with the andronitis, and behind it. The front
of the house towards the street was not large,
as the apartments extended rather in the
direction of its depth than of its width. In
towns the houses were often built side by
side, with party-walls between. The exterior
wall was plain, being composed generally of
stone, brick, and timber, and often covered
with stucco. There was no open space between
the street and the house-door, like the
Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestibulum</i>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόθυρα</span>, which is
sometimes mentioned, seems to be merely
the space in front of the house, where there
was generally an altar of Apollo Agyieus,
or a rude obelisk emblematical of the
god. Sometimes there was a laurel tree in
the same position, and sometimes a head of
the god Hermes. A few steps (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναβαθμοί</span>)
led up to the house-door, which generally
bore some inscription, for the sake of a good
omen, or as a charm. The door sometimes
opened outwards; but this seems to have
been an exception to the general rule, as is
proved by the expressions used for opening,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνδοῦναι</span>, and shutting it, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπισπάσασθαι</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφελκύσασθαι</span>. The handles were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπισπαστῆρες</span>.
The house-door was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὔλειος</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὔλεια θύρα</span>, because it led to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλή</span>.
It gave admittance to a narrow passage
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυρωρεῖον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυλών</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυρών</span>), on one side of
which, in a large house, were the stables, on
the other the porter’s lodge. The duty of
the porter (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυρωρός</span>) was to admit visitors
and to prevent anything improper from being
carried into or out of the house. The porter
was attended by a dog. Hence the phrase
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐλαβεῖσθαι τὴν κύνα</span>, corresponding to the
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cave canem</i>. From the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυρωρεῖον</span> we
pass into the peristyle or court (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιστύλιον</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλή</span>) of the andronitis, which was a space
open to the sky in the centre (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕπαιθρον</span>), and
surrounded on all four sides by porticoes
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στοαί</span>), of which one, probably that nearest the
entrance, was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστόον</span>. These porticoes
were used for exercise, and sometimes
for dining in. Here was commonly the altar
on which sacrifices were offered to the household
gods. In building the porticoes the
object sought was to obtain as much sun in
winter, and as much shade and air in summer
as possible. Round the peristyle were
arranged the chambers used by the men, such
as banqueting rooms (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἶκοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρῶνες</span>), which
were large enough to contain several sets of
couches (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίκλινοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑπτάκλινοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριακοντάκλινοι</span>,
and at the same time to allow abundant room
for attendants, musicians, and performers of
games; parlours or sitting rooms (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξέδραι</span>),
and smaller chambers and sleeping rooms
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δωμάτια</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοιτῶνες</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰκήματα</span>); picture-galleries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
and libraries, and sometimes store-rooms;
and in the arrangement of these
apartments attention was paid to their aspect.
The peristyle of the andronitis was connected
with that of the gynaeconitis by a door called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέταυλος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέσαυλος</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεσαύλιος</span>, which was
in the middle of the portico of the peristyle
opposite to the entrance. By means of this
door all communication between the andronitis
and gynaeconitis could be shut off.</p>

Its name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέσαυλος</span> is evidently derived from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέσος</span>, and means the door <em>between</em> the two

to the peristyle of the gynaeconitis,
which differed from that of the andronitis in
having porticoes round only three of its sides.
On the fourth side were placed two antae
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Antae">Antae</a></span>], at a considerable distance from each
other. A third of the distance between these
antae was set off inwards, thus forming a
chamber or vestibule, which was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάς</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραστάς</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόδρομος</span>. On the right
and left of this <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάς</span> were two bed-chambers,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάλαμος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφιθάλαμος</span>, of which
the former was the principal bed-chamber of
the house, and here also seem to have been
kept the vases, and other valuable articles of
ornament. Beyond these rooms were large
apartments (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστῶνες</span>) used for working in
wool. Round the peristyle were the eating-rooms,
bed-chambers, store-rooms, and other
apartments in common use. Besides the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὔλειος θύρα</span> and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέσαυλος θύρα</span>, there was
a third door (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κηπαία θύρα</span>) leading to the
garden. The preceding is a conjectural plan
of the ground-floor of a Greek house of the
larger size. There was usually, though not
always, an upper story (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπερῷον διῆρες</span>),
which seldom extended over the whole space
occupied by the lower story. The principal
use of the upper story was for the lodging
of the slaves. The access to the upper
floor seems to have been sometimes by stairs
on the outside of the house, leading up from
the street. Guests were also lodged in the
upper story. But in some large houses
there were rooms set apart for their reception
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενῶνες</span>) on the ground-floor. The roofs
were generally flat, and it was customary to
walk about upon them. In the interior of
the house the place of doors was sometimes
supplied by curtains (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραπετάσματα</span>), which
were either plain, or dyed, or embroidered.
The principal openings for the admission of
light and air were in the roofs of the peristyles;
but it is incorrect to suppose that the
houses had no windows (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυρίδες</span>), or at least
none overlooking the street. They were not
at all uncommon. Artificial warmth was
procured partly by means of fire-places. It
is supposed that chimneys were altogether
unknown, and that the smoke escaped through
an opening in the roof (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καπνοδόκη</span>), but it is
not easy to understand how this could be
the case when there was an upper story.
Little portable stoves (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐσχάραι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐσχαρίδες</span>) or
chafing-dishes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνθράκια</span>) were frequently
used. The houses of the wealthy in the
country, at least in Attica, were much larger
and more magnificent than those in the towns.
The latter seem to have been generally small
and plain, especially in earlier times, when
the Greeks preferred expending the resources
of art and wealth on their temples and public
buildings; but the private houses became
more magnificent as the public buildings began
to be neglected. The decorations of the
interior were very plain at the period to
which our description refers. The floors
were of stone. At a late period coloured
stones were used. Mosaics are first mentioned
under the kings of Pergamus. The
walls, up to the 4th century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, seem to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
have been only whited. The first instance of
painting them is that of Alcibiades. This
innovation met with considerable opposition.
We have also mention of painted ceilings at
the same period. At a later period this mode
of decoration became general.&mdash;(2) <span id="Domu_r" class="smcap">Roman.</span>
The houses of the Romans were poor and mean
for many centuries after the foundation of the
city. Till the war with Pyrrhus the houses
were covered only with thatch or shingles,
and were usually built of wood or unbaked
bricks. It was not till the latter times of the
republic, when wealth had been acquired by
conquests in the East, that houses of any
splendour began to be built; but it then became
the fashion not only to build houses of
an immense size, but also to adorn them with
columns, paintings, statues, and costly works
of art. Some idea may be formed of the size
and magnificence of the houses of the Roman
nobles during the later times of the republic
by the price which they fetched. The consul
Messalla bought the house of Autronius for
3700 sestertia (nearly 33,000<em>l.</em>), and Cicero
the house of Crassus, on the Palatine, for
3500 sestertia (nearly 31,000<em>l.</em>). The house
of Publius Clodius, whom Milo killed, cost
14,800 sestertia (about 131,000<em>l.</em>); and the
Tusculan villa of Scaurus was fitted up with
such magnificence, that when it was burnt by
his slaves, he lost 100,000 sestertia, upwards
of 885,000<em>l.</em>&mdash;Houses were originally only
one story high; but as the value of ground
increased in the city they were built several
stories in height, and the highest floors were
usually inhabited by the poor. Till the time
of Nero, the streets in Rome were narrow
and irregular, and bore traces of the haste
and confusion with which the city was built
after it had been burnt by the Gauls; but
after the great fire in the time of that emperor,
by which two-thirds of Rome was burnt
to the ground, the city was built with great
regularity. The streets were made straight
and broad; the height of the houses was restricted,
and a certain part of each was required
to be built of Gabian or Alban stone,
which was proof against fire. The principal
parts of a Roman house were the, 1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vestibulum</i>,
2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostium</i>, 3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atrium</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cavum Aedium</i>,
4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alae</i>, 5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tablinum</i>, 6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fauces</i>, 7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peristylium</i>.
The parts of a house which were considered
of less importance, and of which the
arrangement differed in different houses,
were the, 1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cubicula</i>, 2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triclinia</i>, 3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oeci</i>,
4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exedrae</i>, 5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinacotheca</i>, 6. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bibliotheca</i>,
7. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Balineum</i>, 8. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Culina</i>, 9. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coenacula</i>, 10. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diaeta</i>,
11. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Solaria</i>. We shall speak of each in
order.&mdash;1. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Vestibulum">Vestibulum</a></span> did not properly form
part of the house, but was a vacant space before
the door, forming a court, which was
surrounded on three sides by the house, and
was open on the fourth to the street.&mdash;2. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Ostium">Ostium</a></span>,
which is also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">janua</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fores</i>,
was the entrance to the house. The street-door
admitted into a hall, to which the name
of ostium was also given, and in which there
was frequently a small room (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i>) for the
porter (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">janitor</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostiarius</i>), and also for a dog,
which was usually kept in the hall to guard
the house. Another door (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">janua interior</i>)
opposite the street-door led into the atrium.&mdash;3.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Atrium">Atrium</a></span> or <span class="smcap"><a href="#Cavaedium">Cavum Aedium</a></span>, also written
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cavaedium</i>, are probably only different names
of the same room.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/ill143b.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Atrium of the House of Ceres at Pompeii.</div>
</div>

<p>The Atrium or Cavum
Aedium was a large apartment roofed over
with the exception of an opening in the
centre, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">compluvium</i>, towards which the
roof sloped so as to throw the rain-water into
a cistern in the floor, termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impluvium</i>,
which was frequently ornamented with statues,
columns, and other works of art. The
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impluvium</i>, however, is also employed
to denote the aperture in the roof. The
atrium was the most important room in the
house, and among the wealthy was usually
fitted up with much splendour and magnificence.
Originally it was the only sitting-room
in the house; but in the houses of the
wealthy it was distinct from the private
apartments, and was used as a reception-room,
where the patron received his clients,
and the great and noble the numerous visitors
who were accustomed to call every morning
to pay their respects or solicit favours.
But though the atrium was not used by the
wealthy as a sitting-room for the family, it
still continued to be employed for many purposes
which it had originally served. Thus
the nuptial couch was placed in the atrium
opposite the door, and also the instruments
and materials for spinning and weaving,
which were formerly carried on by the women
of the family in this room. Here also
the images of their ancestors were placed,
and the focus or fire-place, which possessed
a sacred character, being dedicated to the
Lares of each family.&mdash;4. <span class="smcap">Alae</span>, wings, were
small apartments or recesses on the left and
right sides of the atrium.&mdash;5. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Tablinum">Tablinum</a></span> was
in all probability a recess or room at the further
end of the atrium opposite the door
leading into the hall, and was regarded as
part of the atrium. It contained the family
records and archives. With the tablinum
the Roman house appears to have originally
ceased; and the sleeping-rooms were probably
arranged on each side of the atrium. But
when the atrium and its surrounding rooms
were used for the reception of clients and
other public visitors, it became necessary to
increase the size of the house; and the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
rooms were accordingly added:&mdash;6.
<span class="smcap">Fauces</span> appear to have been passages,
which passed from the atrium to the peristylium
or interior of the house.&mdash;7. <span class="smcap">Peristylium</span>
was in its general form like the
atrium, but it was one-third greater in
breadth, measured transversely, than in
length. It was a court open to the sky in the
middle; the open part, which was surrounded
by columns, was larger than the impluvium
in the atrium, and was frequently decorated
with flowers and shrubs.&mdash;The arrangement
of the rooms, which are next to be noticed,
varied according to the taste and circumstances
of the owner. It is therefore impossible
to assign to them any regular place
in the house.&mdash;1. <span class="smcap">Cubicula</span>, bed-chambers,
appear to have been usually small. There
were separate cubicula for the day and night;
the latter were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dormitoria</i>.&mdash;2. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Triclinium">Triclinia</a></span>
are treated of in a separate article.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Triclinium">Triclinium</a>.</span>]&mdash;3. <span class="smcap">Oeci</span>, from the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἶκος</span>, were spacious halls or saloons borrowed
from the Greeks, and were frequently used as
triclinia. They were to have the same proportions
as triclinia, but were to be more
spacious on account of having columns, which
triclinia had not.&mdash;4. <span class="smcap">Exedrae</span> were rooms
for conversation and the other purposes of
society.&mdash;5. <span class="smcap">Pinacotheca</span>, a picture-gallery.&mdash;6,
7. <span class="smcap"><a href="#Bibliotheca">Bibliotheca</a></span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Balneum">Balineum</a></span> are treated

  <div class="caption">Kitchen of the House of Pansa at Pompeii.</div>
</div>

<p>The food was originally cooked in the atrium:
but the progress of refinement afterwards led
to the use of another part of the house for
this purpose. In the kitchen of Pansa’s
house at Pompeii, a stove for stews and similar
preparations was found, very much like
the charcoal stoves used in the present day.
Before it lie a knife, a strainer, and a kind
of frying-pan with four spherical cavities, as
if it were meant to cook eggs.&mdash;9. <span class="smcap">Coenacula</span>,
properly signified rooms to dine in;
but after it became the fashion to dine in the
upper part of the house, the whole of the
rooms above the ground-floor were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coenacula</i>.&mdash;10. <span class="smcap">Diaeta</span>, an apartment used
for dining in, and for the other purposes of
life. It appears to have been smaller than
the triclinium. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diaeta</i> is also the name given
by Pliny to rooms containing three or four
bed-chambers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubicula</i>). Pleasure-houses
or summer-houses are also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diaetae</i>.&mdash;11.
<span class="smcap">Solaria</span>, properly places for basking in
the sun, were terraces on the tops of houses.
The preceding cut represents the atrium of a
house at Pompeii. In the centre is the impluvium,
and the passage at the further end
is the ostium or entrance hall.&mdash;The preceding
account of the different rooms, and
especially of the arrangement of the atrium,
tablinum, peristyle, &amp;c., is best illustrated
by the houses which have been disinterred at
Pompeii. The ground-plan of one is accordingly
subjoined.</p>

</div>

<p>Like most of the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
houses at Pompeii, it had no vestibulum
according to the meaning given above. 1.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostium</i> or entrance-hall, which is six
feet wide and nearly thirty long. Near the
street-door there is a figure of a large fierce
dog worked in mosaic on the pavement, and
beneath it is written <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cave Canem</i>. The two
large rooms on each side of the vestibule appear
from the large openings in front of them
to have been shops; they communicate with
the entrance-hall, and were therefore probably
occupied by the master of the house.
2. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atrium</i>, which is about twenty-eight
feet in length and twenty in breadth; its
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">impluvium</i> is near the centre of the room,
and its floor is paved with white tesserae,
spotted with black. 3. Chambers for the use
of the family, or intended for the reception of
guests, who were entitled to claim hospitality.
4. A small room with a staircase leading
up to the upper rooms. 5. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alae.</i> 6. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tablinum</i>. 7. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fauces</i>. 8. Peristyle,
with Doric columns and garden in the centre.
The large room on the right of the peristyle
is the triclinium; beside it is the kitchen;
and the smaller apartments are cubicula and
other rooms for the use of the family.&mdash;Having
given a general description of the rooms
of a Roman house, it remains to speak of the
(1) floors, (2) walls, (3) ceilings, (4) windows,
and (5) the mode of warming the rooms.
For the doors, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Janua">Janua</a></span>.&mdash;(1.) The floor
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solum</i>) of a room was seldom boarded: it
was generally covered with stone or marble,
or mosaics. The common floors were paved
with pieces of bricks, tiles, stones, &amp;c., forming
a kind of composition called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ruderatic</i>.
Sometimes pieces of marble were imbedded
in a composition ground, and these probably
gave the idea of mosaics. As these floors
were beaten down (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pavita</i>) with rammers
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fistucae</i>), the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pavimentum</i> became the
general name for a floor. Mosaics, called by
Pliny <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lithostrota</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λιθόστρωτα</span>), though this
word has a more extensive meaning, first
came into use in Sulla’s time, who made one
in the temple of Fortune at Praeneste. Mosaic
work was afterwards called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Musivum
opus</i>, and was most extensively employed.&mdash;(2.)
The inner walls (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parietes</i>) of private
rooms were frequently lined with slabs of
marble, but were more usually covered by
paintings, which in the time of Augustus
were made upon the walls themselves. This
practice was so common that we find even
the small houses in Pompeii have paintings
upon their walls.&mdash;(3.) The ceilings seem
originally to have been left uncovered, the
beams which supported the roof or the upper
story being visible. Afterwards planks were
placed across these beams at certain intervals,
leaving hollow spaces, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lacunaria</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laquearia</i>,
which were frequently covered with
gold and ivory, and sometimes with paintings.
There was an arched ceiling in common
use, called <span class="smcap"><a href="#Camara">Camara</a></span>.&mdash;(4.) The Roman
houses had few windows (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fenestrae</i>). The
principal apartments, the atrium, peristyle,
&amp;c., were lighted from above, and the cubicula
and other small rooms generally derived
their light from them, and not from windows
looking into the street. The rooms only
on the upper story seem to have been usually
lighted by windows. The windows appear
originally to have been merely openings in
the wall, closed by means of shutters, which
frequently had two leaves (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bifores fenestrae</i>).
Windows were also sometimes covered by a
kind of lattice or trellis work (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clathri</i>), and
sometimes by net-work, to prevent serpents
and other noxious reptiles from getting in.
Afterwards, however, windows were made of
a transparent stone, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapis specularis</i>
(mica); such windows were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">specularia</i>.
Windows made of glass (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitrum</i>) are
first mentioned by Lactantius, who lived in
the fourth century of the Christian era; but
the discoveries at Pompeii prove that glass
was used for windows under the early emperors.&mdash;(5.)
The rooms were heated in winter
in different ways; but the Romans had no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
stoves like ours. The cubicula, triclinia, and
other rooms, which were intended for winter
use, were built in that part of the house upon
which the sun shone most; and in the mild
climate of Italy this frequently enabled them
to dispense with any artificial mode of warming
the rooms. Rooms exposed to the sun
in this way were sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heliocamini</i>.
The rooms were sometimes heated by hot air,
which was introduced by means of pipes from
a furnace below, but more frequently by
portable furnaces or braziers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foculi</i>), in
which coal or charcoal was burnt. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caminus</i>
was also a kind of stove, in which
wood appears to have been usually burnt, and
probably only differed from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foculus</i> in being
larger and fixed to one place. The rooms
usually had no chimneys for carrying off the
smoke, which escaped through the windows,
doors, and openings in the roof; still chimneys
do not appear to have been entirely unknown
to the ancients, as some are said to
have been found in the ruins of ancient
buildings.</p>


<p id="Donaria">DŌNĀRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναθήματα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνακείμενα</span>), presents
made to the gods, either by individuals
or communities. Sometimes they are also
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dona</i> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῶρα</span>. The belief that the gods
were pleased with costly presents was as
natural to the ancients as the belief that they
could be influenced in their conduct towards
men by the offering of sacrifices; and, indeed,
both sprang from the same feeling.
Presents were mostly given as tokens of gratitude
for some favour which a god had bestowed
on man; as, for instance, by persons
who had recovered from illness or escaped
from shipwreck; but some are also mentioned,
which were intended to induce the
deity to grant some especial favour. Almost
all presents were dedicated in temples, to
which in some places an especial building was
added, in which these treasures were preserved.
Such buildings were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θησαυροί</span>
(treasuries); and in the most frequented
temples of Greece many states had their
separate treasuries. The act of dedication
was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνατιθέναι</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donare</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dedicare</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacrare</i>.</p>

<p id="Dos">DOS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φερνή</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προΐξ</span>), dowry. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>
In the Homeric times it was customary for
the husband to purchase his wife from her
relations, by gifts called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕδνα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔεδνα</span>. But
at Athens, during the historical period, the
contrary was the case; for every woman had
to bring her husband some dowry, and so
universal was the practice, that one of the
chief distinctions between a wife and a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλλακή</span>,
or concubine, consisted in the former
having a portion, whereas the latter had not;
hence, persons who married wives without
portions appear to have given them or their
guardians an acknowledgment in writing
by which the receipt of a portion was admitted.
Moreover, poor heiresses were either
married or portioned by their next of kin,
according to a law, which fixed the amount
of portion to be given at five minae by a Pentacosiomedimnus,
three by a Horseman, and
one and a half by a Zeugites. The husband
had to give to the relatives or guardians of
the wife security (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποτίμημα</span>) for the dowry,
which was not considered the property of the
husband himself, but rather of his wife and
children. The portion was returned to the
wife in case of a divorce.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span> The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dos</i> among the Romans was every thing
which on the occasion of a woman’s marriage
was transferred by her, or by another person,
to the husband. All the property of the wife
which was not made dos continued to be her
own, and was comprised under the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parapherna</i>. The dos upon its delivery became
the husband’s property, and continued
to be his so long as the marriage relation
existed. In the case of divorce, the woman,
or her relations, could bring an action for
the restitution of the dos; and, accordingly,
a woman whose dos was large (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dotata uxor</i>)
had some influence over her husband, inasmuch
as she had the power of divorcing herself,
and thus of depriving him of the enjoyment
of her property.</p>

  <div class="caption">Attic Drachma. (British Museum.)</div>
</div>

<p id="Drachma">DRACHMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δραχμή</span>), the principal silver
coin among the Greeks. The two chief
standards in the currencies of the Greek
states were the Attic and Aeginetan. The
average value of the Attic drachma was 9¾<em>d.</em>
of our money. It contained six obols (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀβολοί</span>);
and the Athenians had separate silver coins,
from four drachmae to a quarter of an obol.
There were also silver pieces of two drachmae
and four drachmae. (See tables.) The tetradrachm
in later times was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stater</i>. The
latter word also signifies a gold coin, equal
in value to twenty drachmae [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Stater">Stater</a></span>]. The
obolos, in later times, was of bronze: but in
the best times of Athens we only read of
silver obols. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκοῦς</span> was a copper coin,
and the eighth part of an obol. The Attic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
standard prevailed most in the maritime and
commercial states. It was the standard of
Philip’s gold, and was introduced by Alexander
for silver also.&mdash;The Aeginetan standard
appears to have been the prevalent one in
early times: we are told that money was
first coined at Aegina by order of Pheidon at
Argos. In later times the Aeginetan standard
was used in almost all the states of the Peloponnesus,
except Corinth. The average value
of the Aeginetan drachma was 1<em>s.</em> 1¾<em>d.</em> in our
money; and the values of the different coins
of this standard are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p id="Ecclesia" class="drop-capy">ECCLĒSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκκλησία</span>), the name of the
general assembly of the citizens at Athens,
in which they met to discuss and determine
upon matters of public interest, and which
was therefore the sovereign power in the
state. These assemblies were either <em>ordinary</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμιμοι</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυρίαι</span>), and held four times in
each prytany, or <em>extraordinary</em>, that is, specially
convened, upon any sudden emergency,
and therefore called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύγκλητοι</span>. The place in
which they were anciently held was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agora</i>. Afterwards they were transferred to
the Pnyx, and at last to the great theatre of
Dionysus, and other places. The most usual
place, however, was the Pnyx, which was
situated to the west of the Areiopagus, on a
slope connected with Mount Lycabettus, and
partly at least within the walls of the city.
It was semicircular in form, with a boundary
wall part rock and part masonry, and an area
of about 12,000 square yards. On the north
the ground was filled up and paved with
large stones, so as to get a level surface on
the slope. Towards this side, and close to
the wall, was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bema</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βῆμα</span>), a stone platform
or hustings ten or eleven feet high,
with an ascent of steps. The position of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bema</i> was such as to command a view of the
sea from behind, and of the Propylaea and
Parthenon in front, and we may be sure that
the Athenian orators would often rouse the
national feelings of their hearers by pointing
to the assemblage of magnificent edifices,
“monuments of Athenian gratitude and
glory,” which they had in view from the
Pnyx.&mdash;The right of convening the people
was generally vested in the prytanes or presidents
of the council of Five Hundred [see
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Boule">Boulé</a></span>], but in cases of sudden emergency,
and especially during wars, the strategi also
had the power of calling extraordinary
meetings, for which, however, the consent of
the senate appears to have been necessary.
The prytanes not only gave a previous notice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
of the day of assembly, and published a programme
of the subjects to be discussed, but
also, it appears, sent a crier round to collect
the citizens. All persons who did not obey
the call were subject to a fine, and six magistrates
called lexiarchs were appointed,
whose duty it was to take care that the
people attended the meetings, and to levy
fines on those who refused to do so. With a
view to this, whenever an assembly was to
be held, certain public slaves (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σκύθαι</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοξόται</span>) were sent round to sweep the agora,
and other places of public resort, with a rope
coloured with vermilion. The different persons
whom these ropemen met, were driven
by them towards the ecclesia, and those who
refused to go were marked by the rope and
fined. An additional inducement to attend,
with the poorer classes, was the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μισθὸς
ἐκκλησιαστικός</span>, or pay which they received
for it. The payment was originally an obolus,
but was afterwards raised to three. The
right of attending was enjoyed by all legitimate
citizens who were of the proper age
(generally supposed to be twenty, certainly
not less than eighteen), and not labouring
under any <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimia</i>, or loss of civil rights.&mdash;In
the article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Boule">Boulé</a></span> it is explained who the
prytanes and the proedri were; and we may
here remark, that it was the duty of the
proedri of the same tribe, under the presidency
of their chairman (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἐπιστάτης</span>), to lay
before the people the subjects to be discussed;
to read, or cause to be read, the previous bill
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ προβούλευμα</span>) of the senate, without which
no measure could be brought before the
ecclesia, and to give permission to the
speakers to address the people. The officers
who acted under them, were the crier
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ κήρυξ</span>), and the Scythian bowmen.&mdash;Previous,
however, to the commencement of any
business, the place was purified by the offering
of sacrifices, and then the gods were
implored in a prayer to bless the proceedings
of the meeting. The privilege of addressing
the assembly was not confined to any class or
age among those who had the right to be
present: all, without any distinction, were
invited to do so by the proclamation, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τίς
ἀγορεύειν βούλεται</span>, which was made by the
crier after the proedri had gone through the
necessary preliminaries, and laid the subject
of discussion before the meeting; for though,
according to the institutions of Solon, those
persons who were above fifty years of age
ought to have been called upon to speak first,
this regulation had in later times become
quite obsolete. The speakers are sometimes
simply called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ παρίοντες</span>, and appear to have
worn a crown of myrtle on their heads while
addressing the assembly. The most influential
and practised speakers of the assembly
were generally distinguished by the name of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥήτορες</span>. After the speakers had concluded,
any one was at liberty to propose a decree,
whether drawn up beforehand or framed in
the meeting, which, however, it was necessary
to present to the proedri, that they
might see, in conjunction with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomophylaces</i>,
whether there was contained in it
anything injurious to the state, or contrary
to the existing laws. If not, it was read by
the crier; though, even after the reading,
the chairman could prevent it being put to
the vote, unless his opposition was overborne
by threats and clamours. Private individuals
also could do the same, by engaging upon
oath (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπωμοσία</span>) to bring against the author
of any measure they might object to, an accusation
called a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ παράνομων</span>. If, however,
the chairman refused to submit any
question to the decision of the people, he
might be proceeded against by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">endeixis</i>; and
if he allowed the people to vote upon a proposal
which was contrary to existing constitutional
laws, he was in some cases liable to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimia</i>. If, on the contrary, no opposition
of this sort was offered to a proposed decree,
the votes of the people were taken, by the
permission of the chairman and with the
consent of the rest of the proedri. The
decision of the people was given either by
show of hands, or by ballot, <em>i.e.</em> by casting
pebbles into urns (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καδίσκοι</span>); the former was
expressed by the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονεῖν</span>, the latter
by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψηφίζεσθαι</span>, although the two terms are
frequently confounded. The more usual method
of voting was by show of hands, as being
more expeditious and convenient (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</span>).
Vote by ballot, on the other hand, was only
used in a few special cases determined by
law; as, for instance, when a proposition
was made for allowing those who had suffered
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimia</i> to appeal to the people for restitution
of their former rights; or for inflicting
extraordinary punishments on atrocious
offenders, and generally, upon any matter
which affected private persons. In cases of
this sort it was settled by law, that a decree
should not be valid unless six thousand
citizens at least voted in favour of it. This
was by far the majority of those citizens who
were in the habit of attending; for, in time
of war, the number never amounted to five
thousand, and in time of peace seldom to ten
thousand.&mdash;The determination or decree of
the people was called a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψήφισμα</span>, which properly
signifies a law proposed to an assembly,
and approved of by the people. Respecting
the form for drawing up a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψήφισμα</span>,
see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Boule">Boulé</a></span>.&mdash;When the business was over,
the order for the dismissal of the assembly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
was given by the prytanes, through the proclamation
of the crier; and as it was not customary
to continue meetings, which usually
began early in the morning, till after sunset,
if one day were not sufficient for the completion
of any business, it was adjourned to
the next. But an assembly was sometimes
broken up, if any one, whether a magistrate
or private individual, declared that he saw
an unfavourable omen, or perceived thunder
and lightning. The sudden appearance of
rain also, or the shock of an earthquake, or
any natural phenomenon of the kind called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διοσημίαι</span>, was a sufficient reason for the
hasty adjournment of an assembly.</p>


<p id="Eccleti">ECCLETI. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Homoei">Homoei</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Ecdicus">ECDĬCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔκδικος</span>), the name of an officer
in many of the towns of Asia Minor during
the Roman dominion, whose principal duty
was the care of the public money, and the
prosecution of all parties who owed money
to the state.</p>


<p id="Ecmartyria">ECMARTȲRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκμαρτυρία</span>), signifies the
deposition of a witness at Athens, who, by
reason of absence abroad, or illness, was
unable to attend in court. His statement
was taken down in writing, in the presence
of persons expressly appointed to receive it,
and afterwards, upon their swearing to its
identity, was read as evidence in the cause.</p>


<p id="Edictum">ĒDICTUM. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Edicendi</i>, or power of
making edicts, belonged to the higher <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magistratus
populi Romani</i>, but it was principally
exercised by the two praetors, the praetor
urbanus, and the praetor peregrinus, whose
jurisdiction was exercised in the provinces
by the praeses. The curule aediles likewise
made many edicts; and tribunes, censors,
and pontifices also promulgated edicts relating
to the matters of their respective jurisdictions.
The edicta were among the sources
of Roman law. The edictum may be described
generally as a rule promulgated by a
magistratus on entering on his office, which
was done by writing it on an album and
exhibiting it in a conspicuous place. As the
office of a magistratus was annual, the rules
promulgated by a predecessor were not binding
on a successor, but he might confirm or
adopt the rules of his predecessor, and introduce
them into his own edict, and hence
such adopted rules were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edictum ralatitium</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vetus</i>, as opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edictum novum</i>.
A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repentinum edictum</i> was that rule which
was made (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prout res incidit</i>) for the occasion.
A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perpetuum edictum</i> was that rule which
was made by the magistratus on entering
upon office, and which was intended to apply
to all cases to which it was applicable during
the year of his office: hence it was sometimes
called also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annua lex</i>. Until it became the
practice for magistratus to adopt the edicta
of their predecessors, the edicta could not
form a body of permanent binding rules;
but when this practice became common, the
edicta (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edictum tralatitium</i>) soon constituted
a large body of law, which was practically of as
much importance as any other part of the law.</p>


<p id="Eicoste">EICOSTĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰκοστή</span>), a tax or duty of one-twentieth
(five per cent.) upon all commodities
exported or imported by sea in the
states of the allies subject to Athens. This
tax was first imposed <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 413, in the place
of the direct tribute which had up to this
time been paid by the subject allies; and the
change was made with the hope of raising a
greater revenue. This tax, like all others,
was farmed, and the farmers of it were
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰκοστολόγοι</span>.</p>


<p id="Eiren">EIRĒN or ĪRĒN (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴρην</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴρην</span>), the name
given to the Spartan youth when he attained
the age of twenty. At the age of eighteen
he emerged from childhood, and was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελλείρην</span>. When he had attained his twentieth
year, he began to exercise a direct influence
over his juniors, and was entrusted
with the command of troops in battle. The
word appears to have originally signified a
commander. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰρένες</span> mentioned in Herodotus,
in connection with the battle of Plataeae,
were certainly not youths, but commanders.</p>


<p id="Eisangelia">EISANGĔLĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσαγγελία</span>), signifies, in its
primary and most general sense, a denunciation
of any kind, but, much more usually, an
information laid before the council or the
assembly of the people, and the consequent
impeachment and trial of state criminals at
Athens under novel or extraordinary circumstances.
Among these were the occasions
upon which manifest crimes were alleged to
have been committed, and yet of such a
nature as the existing laws had failed to
anticipate, or at least describe specifically
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγραφα ἀδικήματα</span>), the result of which omission
would have been, but for the enactment
by which the accusations in question might
be preferred (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμος εἰσαγγελτικός</span>), that a prosecutor
would not have known to what magistrate
to apply; that a magistrate, if
applied to, could not with safety have accepted
the indictment or brought it into
court; and that, in short, there would have
been a total failure of justice.</p>


<p id="Eisiteria">EISITĒRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσιτήρια</span>, <em>scil.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερά</span>), sacrifices
offered at Athens by the senate before the
session began, in honour of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θεοὶ Βουλαῖοι</span>,
<em>i.e.</em> Zeus and Athena.</p>


<p id="Eisphora">EISPHŎRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφορά</span>), an extraordinary
tax on property, raised at Athens, whenever
the means of the state were not sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
carry on a war. It is not quite certain when
this property-tax was introduced; but it
seems to have come first into general use
about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 428. It could never be raised
without a decree of the people, who also
assigned the amount required; and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strategi</i>,
or generals, superintended its collection,
and presided in the courts where disputes
connected with, or arising from, the levying
of the tax were settled. The usual expressions
for paying this property-tax are:
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφέρειν χρήματα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφέρειν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὴν σωτηρίαν τῆς πόλεως</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφορὰς εἰσφέρειν</span>,
and those who paid it were called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ εἰσφέροντες</span>. The census of Solon was at
first the standard according to which the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eisphora</i> was raised, until in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 377 a new
census was instituted, in which the people,
for the purpose of fixing the rates of the property-tax,
were divided into a number of
symmoriae (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συμμορίαι</span>) or classes, similar to
those which were afterwards made for the
trierarchy. Each of the ten tribes or phylae,
appointed 120 of its wealthier citizens; and
the whole number of persons included in the
symmoriae was thus 1200, who were considered
as the representatives of the whole
republic. This body of 1200 was divided
into four classes, each consisting of 300. The
first class, or the richest, were the leaders of
the symmoriae (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡγεμόνες συμμοριῶν</span>), and are
often called the three hundred. They probably
conducted the proceedings of the symmoriae,
and they, or, which is more likely,
the demarchs, had to value the taxable property.
Other officers were appointed to make
out the lists of the rates, and were called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιγραφεῖς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαγραφεῖς</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκλογεῖς</span>. When the
wants of the state were pressing, the 300
leaders advanced the money to the others,
who paid it back to the 300 at the regular
time. The first class probably consisted of
persons who possessed property from 12
talents upwards; the second class, of persons
who possessed property from 6 talents and
upwards, but under 12; the third class, of
persons who possessed property from 2
talents upwards, but under 6; the fourth class,
of persons who possessed property from 25
minae upwards, but under 2 talents. The
rate of taxation was higher or lower according
to the wants of the republic at the time;
we have accounts of rates of a 12th, a 50th,
a 100th, and a 500th part of the taxable property.
If any one thought that his property
was taxed higher than that of another man
on whom juster claims could be made, he had
the right to call upon this person to take the
office in his stead, or to submit to a complete
exchange of property. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Antidosis">Antidosis</a>.</span>] No
Athenian, on the other hand, if belonging to
the tax-paying classes, could be exempt from
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eisphora</i>, not even the descendants of
Harmodius and Aristogeiton.</p>


<p id="Electrum">ĒLECTRUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἤλεκτρος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἤλεκτρον</span>), is
used by the ancient writers in two different
senses, either for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amber</i> or for a mixture of
metals composed of gold and silver. In Homer
and Hesiod, it has, in all probability, the
former meaning. The earliest passage of any
Greek writer, in which the word is <em>certainly</em>
used for the metal, is in the <cite>Antigone</cite> of
Sophocles (1038). This alludes to <em>native
electrum</em>; but the compound was also made
artificially. Pliny states that when gold
contains a fifth part of silver, it is called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">electrum</i>; that it is found in veins of gold;
and that it is also made by art: if, he adds,
it contains more than a fifth of silver, it becomes
too brittle to be malleable. But Isidorus
mentions electrum composed of <em>three</em>
parts gold, and <em>one</em> of silver. Electrum was
used for plate, and the other similar purposes
for which gold and silver were employed.
It was also used as a material for money.
Lampridius tells us, that Alexander Severus
struck coins of it; and coins are in existence,
of this metal, struck by the kings of Bosporus,
by Syracuse, and by other Greek states.</p>


<p id="Eleusinia">ĔLEUSĪNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλευσίνια</span>), a festival and
mysteries, originally celebrated only at Eleusis
in Attica, in honour of Demeter and Persephone.
The Eleusinian mysteries, or <em>the</em>
mysteries, as they were sometimes called,
were the holiest and most venerable of all
that were celebrated in Greece. Various
traditions were current among the Greeks
respecting the author of these mysteries:
for, while some considered Eumolpus or
Musaeus to be their founder, others stated
that they had been introduced from Egypt
by Erechtheus, who at a time of scarcity provided
his country with corn from Egypt, and
imported from the same quarter the sacred
rites and mysteries of Eleusis. A third tradition
attributed the institution to Demeter
herself, who, when wandering about in search
of her daughter, Persephone, was believed to
have come to Attica, in the reign of Erechtheus,
to have supplied its inhabitants with
corn, and to have instituted the mysteries at
Eleusis. This last opinion seems to have
been the most common among the ancients,
and in subsequent times a stone was shown
near the well Callichoros at Eleusis, on which
the goddess, overwhelmed with grief and
fatigue, was believed to have rested on her
arrival in Attica. All the accounts and allusions
in ancient writers seem to warrant the
conclusion, that the legends concerning the
introduction of the Eleusinia are descriptions
of a period when the inhabitants of Attica<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
were becoming acquainted with the benefits
of agriculture, and of a regularly constituted
form of society.&mdash;In the reign of Erechtheus
a war is said to have broken out between the
Athenians and Eleusinians; and when the
latter were defeated, they acknowledged the
supremacy of Athens in everything except
the mysteries, which they wished to conduct
and regulate for themselves. Thus the superintendence
remained with the descendants
of Eumolpus [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Eumolpidae">Eumolpidae</a></span>], the daughters of
the Eleusinian king Celeus, and a third class
of priests, the Ceryces, who seem likewise to
have been connected with the family of Eumolpus,
though they themselves traced their
origin to Hermes and Aglauros.&mdash;At the
time when the local governments of the
several townships of Attica were concentrated
at Athens, the capital became also the centre
of religion, and several deities who had
hitherto only enjoyed a local worship, were
now raised to the rank of national gods. This
seems also to have been the case with the
Eleusinian goddess, for in the reign of Theseus
we find mention of a temple at Athens,
called Eleusinion, probably the new and national
sanctuary of Demeter. Her priests
and priestesses now became naturally attached
to the national temple of the capital,
though her original place of worship at Eleusis,
with which so many sacred associations
were connected, still retained its importance
and its special share in the celebration of the
national solemnities.&mdash;We must distinguish
between the greater Eleusinia, which were
celebrated at Athens and Eleusis, and the
lesser, which were held at Agrae on the
Ilissus. The lesser Eleusinia were only a
preparation (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προκάθαρσις</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προάγνευσις</span>) for
the real mysteries. They were held every
year in the month of Anthesterion, and, according
to some accounts, in honour of Persephone
alone. Those who were initiated
in them bore the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mystae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μύσται</span>),
and had to wait at least another year before
they could be admitted to the great mysteries.
The principal rites of this first stage
of initiation consisted in the sacrifice of a
sow, which the mystae seem to have first
washed in the Cantharus, and in the purification
by a priest, who bore the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hydranos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὑδρανός</span>). The mystae had also
to take an <ins class="corr" id="tn-150" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'oath of secresy'">
oath of secrecy</ins>, which was administered
to them by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mystagogus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυσταγωγός</span>,
also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροφάντης</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προφήτης</span>), and
they received some kind of preparatory instruction,
which enabled them afterwards to
understand the mysteries which were revealed
to them in the great Eleusinia.&mdash;The great
mysteries were celebrated every year in the
month of Boedromion, during nine days,
from the 15th to the 23rd, both at Athens
and Eleusis. The initiated were called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπόπται</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφυροι</span>. On the first day, those
who had been initiated in the lesser Eleusinia,
assembled at Athens. On the second
day the mystae went in solemn procession
to the sea-coast, where they underwent a
purification. Of the third day scarcely anything
is known with certainty; we are only
told that it was a day of fasting, and that in
the evening a frugal meal was taken, which
consisted of cakes made of sesame and honey.
On the fourth day the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλάθος κάθοδος</span> seems
to have taken place. This was a procession
with a basket containing pomegranates and
poppy-seeds; it was carried on a waggon
drawn by oxen, and women followed with
small mystic cases in their hands. On the
fifth day, which appears to have been called
the torch day (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡ τῶν λαμπάδων ἡμέρα</span>), the
mystae, led by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δᾳδοῦχος</span>, went in the evening
with torches to the temple of Demeter at
Eleusis, where they seem to have remained
during the following night. This rite was
probably a symbolical representation of Demeter
wandering about in search of Persephone.
The sixth day, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iacchos</i>, was
the most solemn of all. The statue of Iacchos,
son of Demeter, adorned with a garland of
myrtle and bearing a torch in his hand, was
carried along the sacred road amidst joyous
shouts and songs, from the Cerameicus to
Eleusis. This solemn procession was accompanied
by great numbers of followers and
spectators. During the night from the sixth
to the seventh day the mystae remained at
Eleusis, and were initiated into the last mysteries
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐποπτεία</span>). Those who were neither
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπόπται</span> nor <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μύσται</span> were sent away by a
herald. The mystae now repeated the oath
of secrecy which had been administered to
them at the lesser Eleusinia, underwent a
new purification, and then they were led by
the mystagogus in the darkness of night into
the lighted interior of the sanctuary (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φωταγωγία</span>),
and were allowed to see (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐτοψία</span>)
what none except the epoptae ever beheld.
The awful and horrible manner in which the
initiation is described by later, especially
Christian writers, seems partly to proceed
from their ignorance of its real character,
partly from their horror of and aversion to
these pagan rites. The more ancient writers
always abstained from entering upon any
description of the subject. Each individual,
after his initiation, is said to have been dismissed
by the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόγξ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄμπαξ</span>, in order to
make room for other mystae. On the seventh
day the initiated returned to Athens
amid various kinds of raillery and jests, especially
at the bridge over the Cephisus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
where they sat down to rest, and poured
forth their ridicule on those who passed by.
Hence the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γεφυρίζειν</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γεφυρισμός</span>.
These <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκώμματα</span> seem, like the procession
with torches to Eleusis, to have been dramatical
and symbolical representations of the
jests by which, according to the ancient
legend, Iambe or Baubo had dispelled the
grief of the goddess and made her smile. We
may here observe, that probably the whole
history of Demeter and Persephone was in
some way or other symbolically represented
at the Eleusinia. The eighth day, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epidauria</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπιδαύρια</span>), was a kind of additional
day for those who by some accident
had come too late, or had been prevented
from being initiated on the sixth day. It
was said to have been added to the original
number of days, when Asclepius, coming over
from Epidaurus to be initiated, arrived too
late, and the Athenians, not to disappoint
the god, added an eighth day. The ninth
and last day bore the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλημοχοαί</span>,
from a peculiar kind of vessel called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλημοχοή</span>,
which is described as a small kind of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κότυλος</span>. Two of these vessels were on this
day filled with water or wine, and the contents
of the one thrown to the east, and those
of the other to the west, while those who
performed this rite uttered some mystical
words.&mdash;The Eleusinian mysteries long survived
the independence of Greece. Attempts
to suppress them were made by the emperor
Valentinian, but he met with strong opposition,
and they seem to have continued down
to the time of the elder Theodosius. Respecting
the secret doctrines which were revealed
in them to the initiated, nothing certain is
known. The general belief of the ancients
was, that they opened to man a comforting
prospect of a future state. But this feature
does not seem to have been originally connected
with these mysteries, and was probably
added to them at the period which followed
the opening of a regular intercourse
between Greece and Egypt, when some of
the speculative doctrines of the latter country,
and of the East, may have been introduced
into the mysteries, and hallowed by the
names of the venerable bards of the mythical
age. This supposition would also account, in
some measure, for the legend of their introduction
from Egypt. In modern times many
attempts have been made to discover the
nature of the mysteries revealed to the initiated,
but the results have been as various
and as fanciful as might be expected. The
most sober and probable view is that, according
to which, “they were the remains of a
worship which preceded the rise of the Hellenic
mythology and its attendant rites,
grounded on a view of nature, less fanciful,
more earnest, and better fitted to awaken
both philosophical thought and religious
feeling.”</p>


<p id="Eleutheria">ĔLEUTHĔRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλευθέρια</span>), the feast of
liberty, a festival which the Greeks, after the
battle of Plataeae (479 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), instituted in
honour of Zeus Eleutherios (the deliverer).
It was intended not merely to be a token of
their gratitude to the god to whom they believed
themselves to be indebted for their
victory over the barbarians, but also as a
bond of union among themselves; for, in an
assembly of all the Greeks, Aristeides carried
a decree that delegates (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι καὶ θεωροί</span>)
from all the Greek states should assemble
every year at Plataeae for the celebration of
the Eleutheria. The town itself was at the
same time declared sacred and inviolable, as
long as its citizens offered the annual sacrifices
which were then instituted on behalf of
Greece. Every fifth year these solemnities
were celebrated with contests, in which the
victors were rewarded with chaplets.</p>


<p id="Ellotia">ELLŌTĬA or HELLŌTĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλλώτια</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑλλώτια</span>), a festival with a torch race celebrated
at Corinth in honour of Athena as a
goddess of fire.</p>


<p id="Emancipatio">ĒMANCĬPĀTĬO, was an act by which the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patria potestas</i> was dissolved in the lifetime
of the parent, and it was so called because it
was in the form of a sale (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipatio</i>). By
the laws of the Twelve Tables it was necessary
that a son should be sold three times in
order to be released from the paternal power,
or to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui juris</i>. In the case of daughters
and grandchildren, one sale was sufficient.
The father transferred the son by the form
of a sale to another person, who manumitted
him, upon which he returned into the power
of the father. This was repeated, and with
the like result. After a third sale, the paternal
power was extinguished, but the son
was re-sold to the parent, who then manumitted
him, and so acquired the rights of a
patron over his emancipated son, which would
otherwise have belonged to the purchaser
who gave him his final manumission.</p>


<p id="Embas">EMBAS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐμβάς</span>), a shoe worn by men, and
which appears to have been the most common
kind of shoe worn at Athens. Pollux says
that it was invented by the Thracians, and
that it was like the low cothurnus. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">embas</i>
was also worn by the Boeotians, and probably
in other parts of Greece.</p>


<p id="Embateia">EMBĂTEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐμβατεία</span>). In Attic law this
word (like the corresponding English one,
<em>entry</em>), was used to denote a formal taking
possession of real property. Thus, when a
son entered upon the land left him by his
father, he was said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐμβατεύειν</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βαδίζειν εἰς<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152</span></span>
τὰ πατρῳα, and thereupon he became <em>seised</em>,
or possessed of his inheritance. If any one
disturbed him in the enjoyment of this property,
with an intention to dispute the title,
he might maintain an action of ejectment,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξούλης δίκη</span>. Before entry he could not
maintain such action.</p>


<p id="Emblema">EMBLĒMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμβλημα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμπαισμα</span>), an inlaid
ornament. The art of inlaying was employed
in producing beautiful works of two
descriptions, viz.;&mdash;1st, those which resembled
our marquetry, buhl, and Florentine
mosaics; and 2dly, those in which crusts
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crustae</i>), exquisitely wrought in bas-relief
and of precious materials, were fastened upon
the surface of vessels or other pieces of furniture.
To the latter class of productions
belonged the cups and plates which Verres
obtained by violence from the Sicilians, and
from which he removed the emblems for the
purpose of having them set in gold instead
of silver.</p>


<p id="Emeriti">ĒMĔRĬTI, the name given to those Roman
soldiers who had served out their time, and
had exemption (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vacatio</i>) from military service.
The usual time of service was twenty
years for the legionary soldiers, and sixteen
for the praetorians. At the end of their
period of service they received a bounty or
reward (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emeritum</i>), either in lands or money,
or in both.</p>


<p id="Emissarium">ĒMISSĀRĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπόνομος</span>), a channel,
natural or artificial, by which an outlet is
formed to carry off any stagnant body of
water. Such channels may be either open or
underground; but the most remarkable works
of the kind are of the latter description, as
they carry off the waters of lakes surrounded
by hills. In Greece, the most striking
example is presented by the subterraneous
channels which carry off the waters of the
lake Copais in Boeotia, which were partly
natural and partly artificial. Some works of
this kind are among the most remarkable
efforts of Roman ingenuity. Remains still
exist to show that the lakes Trasimene, Albano,
Nemi, and Fucino, were all drained by
means of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emissaria</i>, the last of which is still
nearly perfect, and open to inspection, having
been partially cleared by the present king of
Naples. Julius Caesar is said to have first
conceived the idea of this stupendous undertaking,
which was carried into effect by the
Emperor Claudius.</p>


<p id="Emmeni">EMMĒNI DĬKAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμμηνοι δίκαι</span>), suits in
the Athenian courts, which were not allowed
to be pending above a month. This regulation
was confined to those subjects which required
a speedy decision; and of these the
most important were disputes respecting
commerce (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐμπορικαὶ δίκαι</span>). All causes relating
to mines (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεταλλικαὶ δίκαι</span>) were also
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμμηνοι δίκαι</span>, as well as those relating to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔρανοι</span>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Erani">Erani</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Emporium">EMPŎRĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐμπόριον</span>), a place for
wholesale trade in commodities carried by
sea. The name is sometimes applied to a
sea-port town, but it properly signifies only
a particular place in such a town. The word
is derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμπορος</span>, which signifies in
Homer a person who sails as a passenger in
a ship belonging to another person; but in
later writers it signifies the merchant or
wholesale dealer, and differs from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάπηλος</span>,
the retail dealer. The emporium at Athens
was under the inspection of certain officers,
who were elected annually (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιμεληταὶ τοῦ
ἐμπορίου</span>).</p>


<p id="Encaustica">ENCAUSTĬCA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pictura">Pictura</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Enctesis">ENCTĒSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγκτησις</span>), the right of possessing
landed property and houses (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγκτησις γῆς
καὶ οἰκίας</span>) in a foreign country, which was
frequently granted by one Greek state to
another, or to separate individuals of another
state. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐγκτήματα</span> were such possessions in
a foreign country, or in a different <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</span> from
that to which an Athenian belonged by birth.</p>


<p id="Endeixis">ENDEIXIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔνδειξις</span>), properly denotes a
prosecution instituted against such persons
as were alleged to have exercised rights or
held offices while labouring under a peculiar
disqualification. The same form of action
was available against the chairman of the
proedri (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστάτης</span>), who wrongly refused to
take the votes of the people in the assembly;
against malefactors, especially murderers;
traitors, ambassadors accused of malversation,
and persons who furnished supplies to
the enemy during war. The first step taken
by the prosecutor was to lay his information
in writing, also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">endeixis</i>, before the
proper magistrate, who then arrested, or held
to bail, the person criminated, and took the
usual steps for bringing him to trial. There
is great obscurity with respect to the punishment
which followed condemnation. The
accuser, if unsuccessful, was responsible for
bringing a malicious charge (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψευδοῦς ἐνδείξεως
ὑπεύθυνος</span>).</p>


<p id="Endromis">ENDRŎMIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνδρομίς</span>), a thick, coarse
blanket, manufactured in Gaul, and called
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">endromis</span>” because those who had been
exercising in the stadium (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐν δρόμῳ</span>) threw it
over them to obviate the effects of sudden
exposure when they were heated. Notwithstanding
its coarse and shaggy appearance,
it was worn on other occasions as a protection
from the cold by rich and fashionable
persons at Rome.</p>


<p id="Ensis">ENSIS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Gladius">Gladius</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Entasis">ENTĂSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔντασις</span>). The most ancient
columns now existing, diminish immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
and regularly from the base to the neck, so
that the edge forms a straight line&mdash;a mode
of construction which is wanting in grace
and apparent solidity. To correct this, a
swelling outline, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">entasis</i>, was given to
the shaft, which seems to have been the first
step towards combining grace and grandeur
in the Doric column.</p>


<p id="Epangelia">EPANGĔLĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπαγγελία</span>). If a citizen of
Athens had incurred <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimia</i>, the privilege of
taking part or speaking in the public assembly
was forfeited. But as it sometimes might
happen that a person, though not formally
declared <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimus</i>, had committed such crimes
as would, on accusation, draw upon him this
punishment, it was of course desirable that
such individuals, like real <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimi</i>, should be
excluded from the exercise of the rights of
citizens. Whenever, therefore, such a person
ventured to speak in the assembly, any
Athenian citizen had the right to come forward
in the assembly itself and demand of
him to establish his right to speak by a trial
or examination of his conduct (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοκιμασία τοῦ
βίου</span>), and this demand, denouncement, or
threat, was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epangelia</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epangelia
docimasias</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπαγγελία δοκιμασίας</span>). The impeached
individual was then compelled to
desist from speaking, and to submit to a
scrutiny into his conduct, and, if he was
convicted, a formal declaration of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimia</i> followed.</p>


<p id="Epariti">EPARITI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπάριτοι</span>), the name of the
standing army in Arcadia, which was formed
to preserve the independence of the Arcadian
towns, when they became united as one state
after the defeat of the Spartans at Leuctra.
They were 5000 in number, and were paid
by the state.</p>


<p id="Ephebus">EPHĒBUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφηβος</span>), the name of Athenian
youths after they had attained the age
of 18. The state of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ephebeia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφηβεία</span>) lasted
for two years, till the youths had attained the
age of 20, when they became men, and were
admitted to share all the rights and duties of
citizens, for which the law did not prescribe
a more advanced age. Before a youth was
enrolled among the ephebi, he had to undergo
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docimasia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοκιμασία</span>), the object of which
was partly to ascertain whether he was the
son of Athenian citizens, or adopted by a
citizen, and partly whether his body was
sufficiently developed and strong to undertake
the duties which now devolved upon
him. After the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docimasia</i> the young men
received in the assembly a shield and a lance;
but those whose fathers had fallen in the
defence of their country received a complete
suit of armour in the theatre. It seems to
have been on this occasion that the ephebi
took an oath in the temple of Artemis Aglauros,
by which they pledged themselves
never to disgrace their arms or to desert
their comrades; to fight to the last in the
defence of their country, its altars and hearths;
to leave their country not in a worse but in
a better state than they found it; to obey
the magistrates and the laws; to resist all
attempts to subvert the institutions of Attica;
and finally, to respect the religion of
their forefathers. This solemnity took place
towards the close of the year, and the festive
season bore the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ephebia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφήβια</span>).
The external distinction of the ephebi consisted
in the chlamys and the petasus. During
the two years of the ephebeia, which
may be considered as a kind of apprenticeship
in arms, and in which the young men
prepared themselves for the higher duties of
full citizens, they were generally sent into
the country, under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peripoli</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίπολοι</span>), to keep watch in the towns and
fortresses, on the coast and frontier, and to
perform other duties which might be necessary
for the protection of Attica.</p>


<p id="Ephegesis">ĔPHĒGĒSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφήγησις</span>), denotes the method
of proceeding against such criminals as
were liable to be summarily arrested by a
private citizen [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Apagoge">Apagoge</a></span>] when the prosecutor
was unwilling to expose himself to
personal risk in apprehending the offender.
Under these circumstances he made an application
to the proper magistrate, and conducted
him and his officers to the spot where
the capture was to be effected.</p>


<p id="Ephetae">ĔPHĔTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφέται</span>), the name of certain
judges at Athens, who tried cases of homicide.
They were fifty-one in number, selected
from noble families, and more than
fifty years of age. They formed a tribunal
of great antiquity, and were in existence
before the legislation of Solon, but, as the
state became more and more democratical,
their duties became unimportant and almost
antiquated. The Ephetae once sat in one or
other of the five courts, according to the
nature of the causes they had to try. In
historical times, however, they sat in <em>four</em>
only, called respectively the court by the
Palladium (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐπὶ Παλλαδίῳ</span>), by the Delphinium
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐπὶ Δελφινίῳ</span>), by the Prytaneium
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐπὶ Πρυτανείῳ</span>), and the court at Phreatto
or Zea (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐν Φρεαττοῖ</span>). At the first of these
courts they tried cases of unintentional, at
the second, of intentional but justifiable homicide.
At the Prytaneium, by a strange
custom, somewhat analogous to the imposition
of a deodand, they passed sentence upon
the instrument of murder when the perpetrator
of the act was not known. In the
court at Phreatto, on the sea shore at the
Peiraeeus, they tried such persons as were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
charged with wilful murder during a temporary
exile for unintentional homicide.</p>

<p id="Ephippium">ĔPHIPPĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστράβη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφίππιον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφίππειον</span>),
a saddle. Although the Greeks occasionally
rode without any saddle, yet they commonly
used one, and from them the name, together
with the thing, was borrowed by the Romans.
The ancient saddles appear, indeed, to have
been thus far different from ours, that the
cover stretched upon the hard frame was
probably of stuffed or padded cloth rather
than leather, and that the saddle was, as it
were, a cushion fitted to the horse’s back.
Pendent cloths (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><ins class="corr" id="tn-154" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'στρῶματα'">
στρώματα</ins></span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strata</i>) were always
attached to it so as to cover the sides of the
animal; but it was not provided with stirrups.
The saddle with the pendent cloths is
exhibited in the annexed coin. The term
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephippium</span>” was in later times in part
supplanted by the word “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sella</span>,” and the
more specific expression “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sella equestris</span>.”</p>


<p id="Ephori">ĔPHŎRI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφοροι</span>). Magistrates called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephori</i> or overseers were common to many
Dorian constitutions in times of remote antiquity;
but the Ephori of Sparta are the most
celebrated of them all. The origin of the
Spartan ephori is quite uncertain, but their
office in the historical times was a kind of
counterpoise to the kings and council, and in
that respect peculiar to Sparta alone of the
Dorian states. Their number, five, appears
to have been always the same, and was probably
connected with the five divisions of the
town of Sparta, namely, the four <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῶμαι</span>, Limnae,
Mesoa, Pitana, Cynosura, and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πόλις</span>
or city properly so called, around which the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῶμαι</span> lay. They were elected from and by
the people, without any qualification of age
or property, and without undergoing any
scrutiny; so that the people enjoyed through
them a participation in the highest magistracy
of the state. They entered upon office
at the autumnal solstice, and the first in rank
of the five gave his name to the year, which
was called after him in all civil transactions.
They possessed judicial authority in civil
suits, and also a general superintendence
over the morals and domestic economy of the
nation, which in the hands of able men would
soon prove an instrument of unlimited power.
Their jurisdiction and power were still further
increased by the privilege of instituting
scrutinies (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὔθυναι</span>) into the conduct of all the
magistrates. Even the kings themselves
could be brought before their tribunal (as
Cleomenes was for bribery). In extreme
cases, the ephors were also competent to lay
an accusation against the kings as well as the
other magistrates, and bring them to a capital
trial before the great court of justice. In
later times the power of the ephors was
greatly increased; and this increase appears
to have been principally owing to the fact,
that they put themselves in connection with
the assembly of the people, convened its
meetings, laid measures before it, and were
constituted its agents and representatives.
When this connection arose is matter of conjecture.
The power which such a connection
gave would, more than anything else, enable
them to encroach on the royal authority, and
make themselves virtually supreme in the
state. Accordingly, we find that they transacted
business with foreign ambassadors;
dismissed them from the state; decided upon
the government of dependent cities; subscribed
in the presence of other persons to
treaties of peace; and in time of war sent
out troops when they thought necessary. In
all these capacities the ephors acted as the
representatives of the nation, and the agents
of the public assembly, being in fact the executive
of the state. In course of time the
kings became completely under their control.
For example, they fined Agesilaus on the
vague charge of trying to make himself popular,
and interfered even with the domestic
arrangements of other kings. In the field
the kings were followed by two ephors, who
belonged to the council of war; the three
who remained at home received the booty in
charge, and paid it into the treasury, which
was under the superintendence of the whole
College of Five. But the ephors had still
another prerogative, based on a religious
foundation, which enabled them to effect a
temporary deposition of the kings. Once in
eight years, as we are told, they chose a calm
and cloudless night to observe the heavens,
and if there was any appearance of a falling
meteor, it was believed to be a sign that the
gods were displeased with the kings, who
were accordingly suspended from their functions
until an oracle allowed of their restoration.
The outward symbols of supreme
authority also were assumed by the ephors;
and they alone kept their seats while the
kings passed; whereas it was not considered
below the dignity of the kings to rise in
honour of the ephors. When Agis and Cleomenes
undertook to restore the old constitution,
it was necessary for them to overthrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
the ephoralty, and accordingly Cleomenes
murdered the ephors for the time being, and
abolished the office (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 225); it was, however,
restored under the Romans.</p>


<p id="Epibatae">ĔPĬBĂTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιβάται</span>), were soldiers or
marines appointed to defend the vessels in
the Athenian navy, and were entirely distinct
from the rowers, and also from the land soldiers,
such as hoplitae, peltasts, and cavalry.
It appears that the ordinary number of epibatae
on board a trireme was ten. The epibatae
were usually taken from the thetes, or
fourth class of Athenian citizens. The term
is sometimes also applied by the Roman
writers to the marines, but they are more
usually called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">classiarii milites</i>. The latter
term, however, is also applied to the rowers
or sailors as well as the marines.</p>


<p id="Epibole">ĔPĬBŎLĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιβολή</span>), a fine imposed by a
magistrate, or other official person or body,
for a misdemeanour. The various magistrates
at Athens had (each in his own department)
a summary penal jurisdiction; <em>i.e.</em> for certain
offences they might inflict a pecuniary mulct
or fine, not exceeding a fixed amount; if the
offender deserved further punishment, it was
their duty to bring him before a judicial tribunal.
These <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epibolae</i> are to be distinguished
from the penalties awarded by a jury or
court of law (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τιμήματα</span>) upon a formal prosecution.</p>


<p id="Epiclerus">ĔPĬCLĒRUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκληρος</span>, heiress), the name
given to the daughter of an Athenian citizen,
who had no son to inherit his estate. It was
deemed an object of importance at Athens to
preserve the family name and property of
every citizen. This was effected, where a
man had no child, by adoption (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσποίησις</span>);
if he had a daughter, the inheritance was
transmitted through her to a grandson, who
would take the name of the maternal ancestor.
If the father died intestate, the heiress
had not the choice of a husband, but was
bound to marry her nearest relation, not in
the ascending line. When there was but one
daughter, she was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκληρος ἐπὶ παντὶ
τῷ οἴκῳ</span>. If there were more, they inherited
equally, like our co-parceners; and were severally
married to relatives, the nearest having
the first choice.</p>


<p id="Epidoseis">ĔPĬDŎSEIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδόσεις</span>), voluntary contributions,
either in money, arms, or ships,
which were made by the Athenian citizens in
order to meet the extraordinary demands of
the state. When the expenses of the state
were greater than its revenue, it was usual
for the prytaneis to summon an assembly of
the people, and after explaining the necessities
of the state, to call upon the citizens to
contribute according to their means. Those
who were willing to contribute then rose and
mentioned what they would give; while
those who were unwilling to give any thing
remained silent, or retired privately from the
assembly.</p>


<p id="Epimeletae">ĔPĬMĔLĒTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιμεληταί</span>), the names of
various magistrates and functionaries at
Athens.&mdash;(1) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπιμελητὴς τῆς κοινῆς προσόδου</span>,
more usually called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμίας</span>, the treasurer or
manager of the public revenue. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tamiae">Tamias</a>.</span>]&mdash;(2)
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν μοριῶν Ἐλαιῶν</span>, were persons
chosen from among the Areopagites to
take care of the sacred olive trees.&mdash;(3) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπιμεληταὶ
τοῦ Ἐμπορίου</span>, were the overseers of
the emporium. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Emporium">Emporium</a>.</span>] They were ten
in number, and were elected yearly by lot.
They had the entire management of the emporium,
and had jurisdiction in all breaches
of the commercial laws.&mdash;(4) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν
Μυστηρίων</span>, were, in connection with the king
archon, the managers of the Eleusinian mysteries.
They were elected by open vote, and
were four in number.&mdash;(5) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν
νεωρίων</span>, the inspectors of the dockyards,
were ten in number.&mdash;(6) <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν
φυλῶν</span>, the inspectors of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλαὶ</span> or tribes.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribus">Tribus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Episcopi">ĔPISCŎPI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίσκοποι</span>), inspectors, who
were sometimes sent by the Athenians to
subject states. They were also called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φύλακες</span>. It appears that these Episcopi received
a salary at the cost of the cities over
which they presided.</p>


<p id="Epistates">ĔPISTĂTĒS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστάτης</span>).&mdash;(1) The chairman
of the senate and assembly of the people,
respecting whose duties see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Boule">Boulé</a></span> and
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ecclesia">Ecclesia</a></span>.&mdash;(2) The name of the directors of
the public works. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐπισταταὶ τῶν δημοσίων
ἔργων</span>).</p>


<p id="Epistoleus">ĔPISTŎLEUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστολεύς</span>), the officer second
in rank in the Spartan fleet, who succeeded
to the command if any thing happened
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">navarchus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναυάρχος</span>) or admiral.
When the Chians and the other allies of Sparta
on the Asiatic coast sent to Sparta to request
that Lysander might be again appointed to
the command of the navy, he was sent with
the title of epistoleus, because the laws of
Sparta did not permit the same person to hold
the office of navarchus twice.</p>


<p id="Epistylium">ĔPISTȲLĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστύλιον</span>), properly, as the
name implies, the architrave, or lower member
of an entablature, which lies immediately
over the columns. The word is sometimes
also used for the whole of the entablature.</p>


<p id="Epitropus">ĔPĬTRŎPUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτροπος</span>), the name at
Athens of a guardian of orphan children. Of
such guardians there were at Athens three
kinds: first, those appointed in the will of
the deceased father; secondly, the next of
kin, whom the law designated as tutores legitimi
in default of such appointment, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
who required the authorization of the archon
to enable them to act; and lastly, such persons
as the archon selected if there were no
next of kin living to undertake the office.
The duties of the guardian comprehended the
education, maintenance, and protection of
the ward, the assertion of his rights, and
the safe custody and profitable disposition
of his inheritance during his minority, besides
making a proper provision for the widow
if she remained in the house of her late
husband.</p>


<p id="Epobelia">ĔPŌBĔLIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπωβελία</span>), as its etymology
implies, at the rate of one obolus for a drachma,
or one in six, was payable on the assessment
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τίμημα</span>) of several private causes, and
sometimes in a case of phasis, by the litigant
that failed to obtain the votes of one-fifth of
the dicasts.</p>


<p id="Eponymus">ĔPŌNỸMUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Archon">Archon</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Epoptae">ĔPOPTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπόπται</span>). [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Eleusinia">Eleusinia</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Epulones">ĔPŬLŌNES, who were originally three in
number (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triumviri epulones</i>), were first created
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 196, to attend to the Epulum
Jovis, and the banquets given in honour of
the other gods; which duty had originally
belonged to the pontifices. Their number
was afterwards increased to seven, and they
were called septemviri epulones or septemviri
epulonum. The epulones formed a collegium,
and were one of the four great religious corporations
at Rome; the other three were
those of the Pontifices, Augures, and Quindecemviri.</p>


<p id="Epulum">ĔPŬLUM JŎVIS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Epulones">Epulones</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Equiria">ĔQUĪRĬA, horse-races, which are said
to have been instituted by Romulus in honour
of Mars, and were celebrated in the
Campus Martius. There were two festivals
of this name; of which one was celebrated
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> III. Cal. Mart., and the other prid. Id.
Mart.</p>


<p id="Equites">ĔQUĬTES, horsemen. Romulus is said to
have formed three centuries of equites; and
these were the same as the 300 Celeres, whom
he kept about his person in peace and war.
A century was taken from each of the three
tribes, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ramnes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Titienses</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Luceres</i>.
Tarquinius Priscus added three more, under
the title of Ramnes, Titienses, and Luceres
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posteriores</i>. These were the six patrician
centuries of equites, often referred to under
the name of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sex suffragia</i>. To these Servius
Tullius added twelve more centuries, for
admission into which, property and not birth
was the qualification. These twelve centuries
might therefore contain plebeians, but
they do not appear to have been restricted to
plebeians, since we have no reason for believing
that the six old centuries contained
the <em>whole</em> body of patricians. A property
qualification was apparently also necessary
by the Servian constitution for admission into
the six centuries. We may therefore suppose
that those patricians who were included
in the six old centuries were allowed by the
Servian constitution to continue in them, if
they possessed the requisite property; and
that all other persons in the state, whether
patricians or plebeians, who possessed the
requisite property, were admitted into the
twelve new centuries. We are not told the
amount of property necessary to entitle a
person to a place among the equites, but it
was probably the same as in the latter times
of the republic, that is, four times that of
the first class. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Comitia">Comitia</a></span>, <a href="#Page_105">p. 105</a>.] Property,
however, was not the only qualification; for
in the ancient times of the republic no one
was admitted among the equestrian centuries
unless his character was unblemished, and
his father and grandfather had been born
freemen. Each of the equites received a
horse from the state (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equus publicus</i>), or
money to purchase one, as well as a sum of
money for its annual support; the expense
of its support was defrayed by the orphans
and unmarried females; since, in a military
state, it could not be esteemed unjust, that the
women and the children were to contribute
largely for those who fought in behalf of
them and of the commonwealth. The purchase-money
for a knight’s horse was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes equestre</i>, and its annual provision <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes
hordearium</i>. The former amounted, according
to Livy, to 10,000 asses, and the latter
to 2000.&mdash;All the equites, of whom we have
been speaking, received a horse from the
state, and were included in the 18 equestrian
centuries of the Servian constitution; but in
course of time, we read of another class of
equites in Roman history, who did not receive
a horse from the state, and who were
not included in the 18 centuries. This latter
class is first mentioned by Livy, in his account
of the siege of Veii, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 403. He says
that during the siege, when the Romans had
at one time suffered great disasters, all those
citizens who had an equestrian fortune, and
no horse allotted to them, volunteered to
serve with their own horses; and he adds,
that from this time equites first began to
serve with their own horses. The state paid
them, as a kind of compensation for serving
with their own horses. The foot soldiers
had received pay a few years before; and
two years afterwards, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 401, the pay of
the equites was made three-fold that of the
infantry. From the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 403, there
were therefore two classes of Roman knights:
one who received horses from the state, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
are therefore frequently called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equites equo
publico</i>, and sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flexumines</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trossuli</i>,
and another class, who served, when
they were required, with their own horses,
but were not classed among the 18 centuries.
As they served on horseback they were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equites</i>; and when spoken of in opposition
to cavalry, which did not consist of Roman
citizens, they were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equites Romani</i>;
but they had no legal claim to the
name of equites, since in ancient times this
title was strictly confined to those who received
horses from the state.&mdash;The reason of
this distinction of two classes arose from the
fact, that the number of equites in the 18
centuries was fixed from the time of Servius
Tullius. As vacancies occurred in them, the
descendants of those who were originally enrolled
succeeded to their places, provided
they had not dissipated their property. But
in course of time, as population and wealth
increased, the number of persons who possessed
an equestrian fortune, also increased
greatly; and as the ancestors of these persons
had not been enrolled in the 18 centuries,
they could not receive horses from the
state, and were therefore allowed the privilege
of serving with their own horses among
the cavalry, instead of the infantry, as they
would otherwise have been obliged to have
done.&mdash;The inspection of the equites who
received horses from the state belonged to
the censors, who had the power of depriving
an eques of his horse, and reducing him to
the condition of an aerarian, and also of
giving the vacant horse to the most distinguished
of the equites who had previously
served at their own expense. For these
purposes they made during their censorship
a public inspection, in the forum, of all the
knights who possessed public horses (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equitatum
recognoscere</i>). The tribes were taken in
order, and each knight was summoned by
name. Every one, as his name was called,
walked past the censors, leading his horse.
If the censors had no fault to find either with
the character of the knight or the equipments
of his horse, they ordered him to pass on
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><ins class="corr" id="tn-157" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'traduc equum'">traducere equum</ins></i>);
but if on the contrary they
considered him unworthy of his rank, they
struck him out of the list of knights, and
deprived him of his horse, or ordered him to
sell it, with the intention no doubt that the
person thus degraded should refund to the
state the money which had been advanced to
him for its purchase.&mdash;This review of the
equites by the censors must not be confounded
with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equitum Transvectio</i>, which was a
solemn procession of the body every year on
the Ides of Quintilis (July). The procession
started from the temple of Mars outside the
city, and passed through the city over the
forum, and by the temple of the Dioscuri.
On this occasion the equites were always
crowned with olive chaplets, and wore their
state dress, the trabea, with all the honourable
distinctions which they had gained in
battle. According to Livy, this annual procession
was first established by the censors
Q. Fabius and P. Decius, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 304; but according
to Dionysius it was instituted after
the defeat of the Latins near the lake Regillus,
of which an account was brought to
Rome by the Dioscuri.&mdash;It may be asked how
long did the knight retain his public horse,
and a vote in the equestrian century to which
he belonged? On this subject we have no
positive information; but as those equites,
who served with their own horses, were only
obliged to serve for ten years (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stipendia</i>)
under the age of 46, we may presume that
the same rule extended to those who served
with the public horses, provided they <em>wished</em>
to give up the service. For it is certain that
in the ancient times of the republic a knight
might retain his horse as long as he pleased,
even after he had entered the senate, provided
he continued able to discharge the duties of
a knight. Thus the two censors, M. Livius
Salinator and C. Claudius Nero, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 204,
were also equites, and L. Scipio Asiaticus, who
was deprived of his horse by the censors in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 185, had himself been censor in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 191.
But during the later times of the republic the
knights were obliged to give up their horses
on entering the senate, and consequently
ceased to belong to the equestrian centuries.
It thus naturally came to pass, that the
greater number of the equites equo publico,
after the exclusion of senators from the
equestrian centuries, were young men.&mdash;The
equestrian centuries, of which we have
hitherto been treating, were only regarded
as a division of the army: they did not form
a distinct class or ordo in the constitution.
The community, in a political point of view,
was divided only into patricians and plebeians,
and the equestrian centuries were composed
of both. But in the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 123, a new
class, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ordo Equestris</i>, was formed
in the state by the Lex Sempronia, which was
introduced by C. Gracchus. By this law, or
one passed a few years afterwards, every person
who was to be chosen judex was required to be
above 30 and under 60 years of age, to have
either an equus publicus, or to be qualified
by his fortune to possess one, and <em>not</em> to be
a senator. The number of judices, who were
required yearly, was chosen from this class
by the praetor urbanus. As the name of
equites had been originally extended from
those who possessed the public horses to those
who served with their own horses, it now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
came to be applied to all those persons who
were qualified by their fortune to act as
judices, in which sense the word is usually
used by Cicero. After the reform of Sulla,
which entirely deprived the equestrian order
of the right of being chosen as judices, and
the passing of the Lex Aurelia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 70),
which ordained that the judices should be
chosen from the senators, equites, and tribuni
aerarii, the influence of the order, says Pliny,
was still maintained by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">publicani</i>, or
farmers of the public taxes. We find that the
publicani were almost always called equites,
not because any particular rank was necessary
in order to obtain from the state the farming
of the taxes, but because the state was not
accustomed to let them to any one who did
not possess a considerable fortune. Thus the
publicani are frequently spoken of by Cicero
as identical with the equestrian order. The
consulship of Cicero, and the active part which
the knights then took in suppressing the conspiracy
of Catiline, tended still further to
increase the power and influence of the
equestrian order; and “from that time,”
says Pliny, “it became a third body (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus</i>)
in the state, and, to the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senatus Populusque
Romanus</i>, there began to be added
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et Equestris Ordo</i>.” In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63, a distinction
was conferred upon them, which tended
to separate them still further from the plebs.
By the Lex Roscia Othonis, passed in that
year, the first fourteen seats in the theatre
behind the orchestra were given to the
equites. They also possessed the right of
wearing the Clavus Angustus [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Clavus">Clavus</a></span>], and
subsequently obtained the privilege of wearing
a gold ring, which was originally confined
to the equites equo publico. The number
of equites increased greatly under the
early emperors, and all persons were admitted
into the order, provided they possessed the
requisite property, without any inquiry into
their character, or into the free birth of their
father and grandfather. The order in consequence
gradually began to lose all the consideration
which it had acquired during the
later times of the republic.&mdash;Augustus formed
a select class of equites, consisting of those
equites who possessed the property of a
senator, and the old requirement of free
birth up to the grandfather. He permitted
this class to wear the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">latus clavus</i>; and also
allowed the tribunes of the plebs to be chosen
from them, as well as the senators, and gave
them the option, at the termination of their
office, to remain in the senate or return to
the equestrian order. This class of knights
was distinguished by the special title <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">illustres</i>
(sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insignes</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">splendidi</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equites
Romani</i>. The formation of this distinct class
tended to lower the others still more in public
estimation. In the ninth year of the reign
of Tiberius, an attempt was made to improve
the order by requiring the old qualifications
of free birth up to the grandfather, and by
strictly forbidding any one to wear the gold
ring unless he possessed this qualification.
This regulation, however, was of little avail,
as the emperors frequently admitted freedmen
into the equestrian order. When private
persons were no longer appointed judices,
the necessity for a distinct class in the community,
like the equestrian order, ceased
entirely; and the gold ring came at length
to be worn by all free citizens. Even slaves,
after their manumission, were allowed to
wear it by special permission from the emperor,
which appears to have been usually
granted provided the patronus consented.&mdash;Having
thus traced the history of the equestrian
order to its final extinction as a distinct
class in the community, we must now return
to the equites equo publico, who formed the
18 equestrian centuries. This class still
existed during the latter years of the republic,
but had entirely ceased to serve as horse-soldiers
in the army. The cavalry of the
Roman legions no longer consisted, as in the
time of Polybius, of Roman equites, but their
place was supplied by the cavalry of the
allied states. It is evident that Caesar in his
Gallic wars possessed no Roman cavalry.
When he went to an interview with Ariovistus,
and was obliged to take cavalry with
him, we are told that he did not dare to trust
his safety to the Gallic cavalry, and therefore
mounted his legionary soldiers upon their
horses. The Roman equites are, however,
frequently mentioned in the Gallic and civil
wars, but never as common soldiers; they
were officers attached to the staff of the
general, or commanded the cavalry of the
allies, or sometimes the legions.&mdash;After the
year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 50, there were no censors in the
state, and it would therefore follow that for
some years no review of the body took place,
and that the vacancies were not filled up.
When Augustus, however, took upon himself,
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 29, the praefectura morum, he
frequently reviewed the troops of equites,
and restored the long neglected custom of
the solemn procession (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transvectio</i>). From this
time these equites formed an honourable corps,
from which all the higher officers in the army
and the chief magistrates in the state were
chosen. Admission into this body was equivalent
to an introduction into public life, and
was therefore esteemed a great privilege. If
a young man was not admitted into this
body, he was excluded from all civil offices of
any importance, except in municipal towns;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
and also from all rank in the army, with the
exception of centurion. All those equites,
who were not employed in actual service,
were obliged to reside at Rome, where they
were allowed to fill the lower magistracies,
which entitled a person to admission into the
senate. They were divided into six turmae,
each of which was commanded by an officer,
who is frequently mentioned in inscriptions
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sevir equitum Rom. turmae</i> <span class="allsmcap">I. II.</span>, &amp;c., or
commonly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sevir turmae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sevir turmarum
equitum Romanorum</i>. From the time that
the equites bestowed the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">principes
juventutis</i> upon Caius and Lucius Caesar, the
grandsons of Augustus, it became the custom
to confer this title, as well as that of
sevir, upon the probable successor to the
throne, when he first entered into public
life, and was presented with an equus publicus.
The practice of filling all the higher
offices in the state from these equites appears
to have continued as long as Rome was the
centre of the government and the residence
of the emperor. After the time of Diocletian,
the equites became only a city guard,
under the command of the praefectus vigilum;
but they still retained, in the time of
Valentinianus and Valens, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 364, the second
rank in the city, and were not subject
to corporal punishment. Respecting the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magister Equitum</i>, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Dictator">Dictator</a></span>.</p>

so called because it was in the form of a
horse.</p>


<p id="Erani">ĔRĂNI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔρανοι</span>), were clubs or societies,
established for charitable, convivial, commercial,
or political purposes. Unions of
this kind were called by the general name
of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑταιρίαι</span>, and were often converted to mischievous
ends, such as bribery, overawing
the public assembly, or influencing courts of
justice. In the days of the Roman empire
friendly societies, under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erani</i>,
were frequent among the Greek cities, but
were looked on with suspicion by the emperors,
as leading to political combinations.
The <em>gilds</em>, or fraternities for mutual aid,
among the ancient Saxons, resembled the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erani</i> of the Greeks.</p>


<p id="Ergastulum">ERGASTŬLUM, a private prison attached
to most Roman farms, where the slaves were
made to work in chains. The slaves confined
in an ergastulum were also employed to cultivate
the fields in chains. Slaves who had
displeased their masters were punished by
imprisonment in the ergastulum; and in the
same place all slaves, who could not be depended
upon or were barbarous in their
habits, were regularly kept.</p>

the most solemn of all the festivals
celebrated in the Boeotian town of Thespiae.
It took place every fifth year, and in honour
of Eros, the principal divinity of the Thespians.
Respecting the particulars nothing is
known, except that it was solemnised with

<p id="Essedarii">ESSĔDĀRĬI. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Esseda">Essedum</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Esseda">ESSĔDA, or ESSĔDUM (from the Celtic
<em>Ess</em>, a carriage), the name of a chariot used,
especially in war, by the Britons, the Gauls,
and the Germans. It was built very strongly,
was open before instead of behind, like the
Greek war-chariot, and had a wide pole, so
that the owner was able, whenever he pleased,
to run along the pole, and even to raise himself
upon the yoke, and then to retreat with
the greatest speed into the body of the car,
which he drove with extraordinary swiftness
and skill. It appears also that these cars
were purposely made as noisy as possible,
probably by the creaking and clanging of the
wheels; and that this was done in order to
strike dismay into the enemy. The warriors
who drove these chariots were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">essedarii</i>.
Having been captured, they were sometimes
exhibited in the gladiatorial shows at Rome,
and seem to have been great favourites with
the people. The essedum was adopted for
purposes of convenience and luxury among
the Romans. As used by the Romans, the
essedum may have differed from the cisium
in this; that the cisium was drawn by one
horse (see cut, <a href="#ill090a">p. 90</a>), the essedum always by
a pair.</p>


<p id="Eumolpidae">EUMOLPĬDAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐμολπίδαι</span>), the most distinguished
and venerable among the priestly
families in Attica. They were devoted to the
service of Demeter at Athens and Eleusis,
and were said to be the descendants of the
Thracian bard Eumolpus, who, according to
some legends, had introduced the Eleusinian
mysteries into Attica. The high priest of the
Eleusinian goddess (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροφάντης</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυσταγωγός</span>),
who conducted the celebration of her mysteries
and the initiation of the mystae, was
always a member of the family of the Eumolpidae,
as Eumolpus himself was believed to
have been the first hierophant. The hierophant
was attended by four <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epimeletae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιμεληταί</span>),
one of whom likewise belonged to the
family of the Eumolpidae. The Eumolpidae
had on certain occasions to offer up prayers
for the welfare of the state. They had likewise
judicial power in cases where religion
was violated. The law according to which
they pronounced their sentence, and of which
they had the exclusive possession, was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
written, but handed down by tradition; and
the Eumolpidae alone had the right to interpret
it, whence they are sometimes called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exegetae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξηγηταί</span>). In cases for which the
law had made no provisions, they acted according
to their own discretion. In some
cases, when a person was convicted of gross
violation of the public institutions of his
country, the people, besides sending the
offender into exile, added a clause in their
verdict that a curse should be pronounced
upon him by the Eumolpidae. But the Eumolpidae
could pronounce such a curse only
at the command of the people, and might
afterwards be compelled by the people to
revoke it, and purify the person whom they
had cursed before.</p>


<p id="Eupatridae">EUPATRĬDAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐπατρίδαι</span>), descended
from noble ancestors, is the name by which
in early times the nobility of Attica was designated.
In the division of the inhabitants
of Attica into three classes, which is ascribed
to Theseus, the Eupatridae were the first
class, and thus formed a compact order of
nobles, united by their interests, rights, and
privileges. They were in the exclusive possession
of all the civil and religious offices in
the state, ordered the affairs of religion, and
interpreted the laws human and divine. The
king was thus only the first among his equals,
and only distinguished from them by the duration
of his office. By the legislation of
Solon, the political power and influence of
the Eupatridae as an order was broken, and
property instead of birth was made the
standard of political rights. But as Solon,
like all ancient legislators, abstained from
abolishing any of the religious institutions,
those families of the Eupatridae, in which
certain priestly offices and functions were
hereditary, retained these distinctions down
to a very late period of Grecian history.</p>

<p id="Euthyne" >EUTHȲNĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐθύνη</span>). All public officers at
Athens were accountable for their conduct
and the manner in which they acquitted
themselves of their official duties. The
judges in the popular court seem to have
been the only authorities who were not responsible,
for they were themselves the
representatives of the people, and would
therefore, in theory, have been responsible
to themselves. This account, which officers
had to give after the time of their office was
over, was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐθύνη</span>, and the officers subject
to it, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπεύθυνοι</span>, and after they had gone
through the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">euthyne</i>, they became <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνεύθυνοι</span>.
Every public officer had to render his account
within thirty days after the expiration of his
office, and at the time when he submitted to
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">euthyne</i> any citizen had the right to come
forward and impeach him. The officers
before whom the accounts were given were
at Athens ten in number, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὔθυνοι</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λογισταί</span>, in other places <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξετασταί</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνήγοροι</span>.</p>

<p id="Exedra">EXEDRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξέδρα</span>), which properly signifies

portico, where people met to enjoy conversation;
such as the rooms attached to a gymnasium,
which were used for the lectures
and disputations of the rhetoricians and philosophers.
In old Greek the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λέσχη</span>
appears to have had a similar meaning; but
the ordinary use of the word is for a larger
and more public place of resort than the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξέδρα</span>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lesche">Lesche</a>.</span>] Among the Romans the
word had a wider meaning, answering to

<p id="Exegetae">EXĒGĒTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξηγηταί</span>, interpreters) is the

<p>1. <em>Spartan Army.</em>&mdash;In all the states of
Greece, in the earliest as in later times, the
general type of their military organisation
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phalanx</i>, a body of troops in close
array with a long spear as their principal
weapon. It was among the Dorians, and
especially among the Spartans, that this type
was most rigidly adhered to. The strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
of their military array consisted in the heavy-armed
infantry (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁπλίται</span>). They attached
comparatively small importance to their
cavalry, which was always inferior. Indeed,
the Thessalians and Boeotians were the only
Greek people who distinguished themselves
much for their cavalry; scarcely any other
states had territories adapted for the evolutions
of cavalry. The whole life of a Spartan
was little else than either the preparation for
or the practice of war. The result was, that
in the strictness of their discipline, the precision
and facility with which they performed
their military evolutions, and the skill and
power with which they used their weapons,
the Spartans were unrivalled among the
Greeks. The heavy-armed infantry of the
Spartan armies was composed partly of
genuine Spartan citizens, partly of Perioeci.
Every Spartan citizen was liable to military
service (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμφρουρος</span>) from the age of twenty
to the age of sixty years. They were divided
into six divisions called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόραι</span>, under the
command or superintendence of a polemarch,
each mora being subdivided into four <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόχοι</span>
(commanded by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοχαγοί</span>), each <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόχος</span> into two
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκοστύες</span> (headed by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκοστῆρες</span>), each
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκοστύς</span> into two <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνωμοτίαι</span> (headed by
enomotarchs). The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνωμοτίαι</span> were so called
from the men composing them being bound
together by a common oath. These were not
merely divisions of troops engaged in actual
military expeditions. The whole body of
citizens at all times formed an army, whether
they were congregated at head-quarters in
Sparta, or a portion of them were detached
on foreign service. The strength of a mora
on actual service, of course, varied, according
to circumstances. To judge by the name
pentecostys, the normal number of a mora
would have been 400; but 500, 600, and
900 are mentioned as the number of men in a
mora on different occasions. When in the
field, each mora of infantry was attended by
a mora of cavalry, consisting at the most of
100 men, and commanded by an hipparmost
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππαρμοστής</span>). Plutarch mentions squadrons
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐλαμοί</span>) of fifty, which may possibly be the
same divisions. The cavalry seems merely
to have been employed to protect the flanks,
and but little regard was paid to it. The
corps of 300 <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππεῖς</span> formed a sort of body-guard
for the king, and consisted of the flower
of the young soldiers. Though called horsemen,
they fought on foot. A Spartan army,
divided as above described, was drawn up in
the dense array of the phalanx, the depth of
which depended upon circumstances. An
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνωμοτία</span> sometimes made but a single file,
sometimes was drawn up in three or six files
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζύγα</span>). The enomotarch stood at the head of
his file (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρωτοστάτης</span>), or at the head of the
right-hand file, if the enomotia was broken
up into more than one. The last man was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐραγός</span>. It was a matter of great
importance that he, like the enomotarch,
should be a man of strength and skill, as in
certain evolutions he would have to lead the
movements. The commander-in-chief, who
was usually the king, had his station sometimes
in the centre, more commonly on the
right wing. The commands of the general
were issued in the first place to the polemarchs,
by these to the lochagi, by these
again to the pentecosteres, by the latter to
the enomotarchs, and by these last to their
respective divisions. From the orderly manner
in which this was done, commands were
transmitted with great rapidity: every soldier,
in fact, regulating the movements of the
man behind him, every two being connected
together as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρωτοστάτης</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστάτης</span>. In
later times the king was usually accompanied
by two ephors, as controllers and advisers.
These, with the polemarchs, the four Pythii,
three peers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅμοιοι</span>), who had to provide for
the necessities of the king in war, the laphyropolae
and some other officers, constituted
what was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">damosia</i> of the king.
The Spartan hoplites were accompanied in
the field by helots, partly in the capacity of
attendants, partly to serve as light-armed
troops. The number attached to an army
was probably not uniform. At Plataeae each
Spartan was accompanied by seven helots;
but that was probably an extraordinary case.
One helot in particular of those attached to
each Spartan was called his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεράπων</span>, and
performed the functions of an armourer or
shieldbearer. Xenophon calls them <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπασπισταί</span>.
In extraordinary cases, helots served
as hoplites, and in that case it was usual to
give them their liberty. A separate troop in
the Lacedaemonian army was formed by the
Sciritae (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σκιρῖται</span>), originally, no doubt, inhabitants
of the district Sciritis. The arms
of the phalanx consisted of the long spear
and a short sword (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξυήλη</span>). The chief part
of the defensive armour was the large brazen
shield, which covered the body from the
shoulder to the knee, suspended, as in
ancient times, by a thong round the neck,
and managed by a simple handle or ring
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόρπαξ</span>). Besides this, they had the ordinary
armour of the hoplite [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Arma">Arma</a></span>]. The
heavy-armed soldiers wore a scarlet uniform.
The Spartan encampments were circular.
Only the heavy-armed were stationed within
them, the cavalry being placed to look out, and
the helots being kept as much as possible outside.
Preparatory to a battle the Spartan
soldier dressed his hair and crowned himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
as others would do for a feast. The signal
for attack was given not by the trumpet, but
by the music of flutes, and sometimes also of
the lyre and cithara, to which the men sang
the battle song (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιὰν ἐμβατήριος</span>). The object
of the music was not so much to inspirit the
men, as simply to regulate the march of the
phalanx. This rhythmical regularity of movement
was a point to which the Spartans
attached great importance.</p>

<p>2. <em>Athenian Army.</em>&mdash;In Athens, the military
system was in its leading principles the
same as among the Spartans, though differing
in detail, and carried out with less exactness;
inasmuch as when Athens became powerful,
greater attention was paid to the navy. Of
the four classes into which the citizens were
arranged by the constitution of Solon, the
citizens of the first and second served as cavalry,
or as commanders of the infantry (still
it need not be assumed that the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππεῖς</span> never
served as heavy-armed infantry), those of
the third class (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζευγῖται</span>) formed the heavy-armed
infantry. The Thetes served either
as light-armed troops on land, or on board
the ships. The same general principles remained
when the constitution was remodelled
by Cleisthenes. The cavalry service continued
to be compulsory on the wealthier
class. Every citizen was liable to service
from his eighteenth to his sixtieth year. On
reaching their eighteenth year, the young
citizens were formally enrolled <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς τὴν ληξιαρχικὸν
γραμματεῖον</span>, and received a shield and
spear in a public assembly of the people,
binding themselves by oath to perform rightly
the duties of a citizen and a soldier. During
the first two years, they were only liable to
service in Attica itself, chiefly as garrison
soldiers in the different fortresses in the
country. During this period, they were
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίπολοι</span>. Members of the senate
during the period of their office, farmers of
the revenue, choreutae at the Dionysia during
the festival, in later times, traders by sea
also, were exempted from military service.
Any one bound to serve who attempted to
avoid doing so, was liable to a sentence of
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</span>. The resident aliens commonly served
as heavy-armed soldiers, especially for the
purpose of garrisoning the city. They were
prohibited from serving as cavalry. Slaves
were only employed as soldiers in cases of
great necessity. Of the details of the Athenian
military organisation, we have no distinct
accounts as we have of those of Sparta.
The heavy-armed troops, as was the universal
practice in Greece, fought in phalanx order.
They were arranged in bodies in a manner
dependent on the political divisions of the
citizens. The soldiers of each tribe (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλή</span>)
formed a separate body in the army, also
called a tribe, and these bodies stood in some
preconcerted order. It seems that the name
of one division was <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάξις</span>, and of another
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόχος</span>, but in what relations these stood to
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλή</span>, and to each other, we do not learn.
Every hoplite was accompanied by an attendant
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">(ὑπηρέτης)</span> to take charge of his baggage,
and carry his shield on a march.
Each horseman also had a servant, called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱπποκόμος</span>, to attend to his horse. For the
command of the army, there were chosen
every year ten generals [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Strategus">Strategi</a></span>], and ten
taxiarchs [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Taxiarchi">Taxiarchi</a></span>], and for the cavalry,
two hipparchs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἵππαρχοι</span>) and ten phylarchs
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φύλαρχοι</span>). Respecting the military functions
of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων πολέμαρχος</span>, see the article
Archon. The number of strategi sent with
an army was not uniform. Three was a
common number. Sometimes one was invested
with the supreme command; at other
times, they either took the command in turn
(as at Marathon), or conducted their operations
by common consent (as in the Sicilian
expedition). The practice of paying the
troops when upon service was first introduced
by Pericles. The pay consisted partly
of wages (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μισθός</span>), partly of provisions, or,
more commonly, provision-money (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτηρέσιον</span>).
The ordinary <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μισθός</span> of a hoplite was two
obols a day. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτηρέσιον</span> amounted to two
obols more. Hence, the life of a soldier was
called, proverbially, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετρωβόλου βίος</span>. Officers
received twice as much; horsemen, three
times; generals, four times as much. The
horsemen received pay even in time of peace,
that they might always be in readiness, and
also a sum of money for their outfit (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατάστασις</span>).
As regards the military strength of
the Athenians, we find 10,000 heavy-armed
soldiers at Marathon, 8,000 heavy-armed, and
as many light-armed at Plataeae; and at the
beginning of the Peloponnesian war there were
18,000 heavy-armed ready for foreign service,
and 16,000 consisting of those beyond the
limits of the ordinary military age and of
the metoeci, for garrison service. It was the
natural result of the national character of
the Athenians and their democratical constitution,
that military discipline was much less
stringent among them than among the Spartans,
and after defeat especially it was often
found extremely difficult to maintain it. The
generals had some power of punishing military
offences on the spot, but for the greater
number of such offences a species of court-martial
was held, consisting of persons who
had served in the army to which the offender
belonged, and presided over by the strategi.
Various rewards also were held out for those
who especially distinguished themselves for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
their courage or conduct, in the shape of
chaplets, statues, &amp;c. The Peltastae (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πελτασταί</span>),
so called from the kind of shield
which they wore [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pelta">Pelta</a></span>], were a class of
troops of which we hear very little before the
end of the Peloponnesian war. The Athenian
general Iphicrates introduced some important
improvements in the mode of arming
them, combining as far as possible the peculiar
advantages of heavy (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁπλῖται</span>) and light
armed (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψιλοί</span>) troops. He substituted a linen
corslet for the coat of mail worn by the hoplites,
and lessened the shield, while he doubled
the length of the spear and sword. He even
took the pains to introduce for them an improved
sort of shoe, called after him <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰφικρατίδες</span>.
This equipment proved very effective.
The almost total destruction of a mora of
Lacedaemonian heavy-armed troops by a body
of peltastae under the command of Iphicrates
was an exploit that became very famous.
When the use of mercenary troops became
general, Athenian citizens seldom served except
as volunteers, and then in but small
numbers. The employment of mercenaries
led to considerable alterations in the military
system of Greece. War came to be studied
as an art, and Greek generals, rising above
the old simple rules of warfare, became tacticians.
Epaminondas was the first who
adopted the method of charging in column,
concentrating his attack upon one point of
the hostile line, so as to throw the whole into
confusion by breaking through it.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Macedonian Army.</span>&mdash;Philip, king of
Macedonia, made several improvements in
the arms and arrangement of the phalanx.
The spear (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάρισσα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάρισα</span>), with which
the soldiers of the Macedonian phalanx were
armed, was 24 feet long; but the ordinary
length was 21 feet, and the lines were arranged
at such distances that the spears of
the fifth rank projected three feet beyond the
first, so that every man in the front rank was
protected by five spears. Besides the spear
they carried a short sword. The shield was
very large and covered nearly the whole body,
so that on favourable ground an impenetrable
front was presented to the enemy. The soldiers
were also defended by helmets, coats of
mail, and greaves; so that any thing like
rapid movement was impossible. The ordinary
depth of the phalanx was sixteen files,
though depths of eight and of thirty-two are
also mentioned. Each file of sixteen was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόχος</span>. Two lochi made a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dilochia</i>;
two dilochiae made a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετραρχία</span>, consisting of
sixty-four men; two tetrarchies made a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάξις</span>;
two <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάξεις</span> a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνταγμα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξεναγία</span>, to which
were attached five supernumeraries, a herald,
an ensign, a trumpeter, a servant, and an
officer to bring up the rear (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐραγός</span>); two
syntagmata formed a pentacosiarchia, two of
which made a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χιλιαρχία</span>, containing 1024
men; two chiliarchies made a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέλος</span>, and two
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέλη</span> made a phalangarchia or phalanx in the
narrower sense of the word, the normal number
of which would therefore be 4096. It
was commanded by a polemarch or strategus;
four such bodies formed the larger phalanx,
the normal number of which would be 16,384.
When drawn up, the two middle sections
constituted what was termed the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀμφαλός</span>, the
others being called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κέρατα</span> or wings. The
phalanx soldiers in the army of Alexander
amounted to 18,000, and were divided not
into four, but into six divisions, each named
after a Macedonian province, from which it
was to derive its recruits. These bodies are
oftener called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάξεις</span> than <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλαγγες</span> by the
historians, and their leaders taxiarchs or
strategi. The phalanx of Antiochus consisted
of 16,000 men, and was formed into ten divisions
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέρη</span>) of 1600 each, arranged 50 broad
and 32 deep. The phalanx, of course, became
all but useless, if its ranks were broken.
It required, therefore, level and open ground,
so that its operations were restricted to very
narrow limits; and being incapable of rapid
movement, it became almost helpless in the
face of an active enemy, unless accompanied
by a sufficient number of cavalry and light
troops. The light-armed troops were arranged
in files (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόχοι</span>) eight deep. Four lochi formed a
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύστασις</span>, and then larger divisions were successively
formed, each being the double of
the one below it; the largest (called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίταγμα</span>),
consisting of 8192 men. The cavalry (according
to Aelianus), were arranged in an
analogous manner, the lowest division or
squadron (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴλη</span>), containing 64 men, and the
successive larger divisions being each the
double of that below it; the highest (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίταγμα</span>)
containing 4096. Both Philip and Alexander
attached great importance to the cavalry,
which, in their armies, consisted partly of
Macedonians, and partly of Thessalians. The
Macedonian horsemen were the flower of the
young nobles. They amounted to about 1200
in number, forming eight squadrons, and,
under the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕταιροι</span>, formed a sort of
body-guard for the king. The Thessalian
cavalry consisted chiefly of the elite of the
wealthier class of the Thessalians, but included
also a number of Grecian youth from
other states. There was also a guard of foot
soldiers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπασπισταί</span>), whom we find greatly
distinguishing themselves in the campaigns
of Alexander. They seem to be identical with
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεζέταιροι</span>, of whom we find mention.
They amounted to about 3000 men, arranged
in six battalions (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάξεις</span>). There was also a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
troop called Argyraspids, from the silver with
which their shields were ornamented. They
seem to have been a species of peltastae.
Alexander also organised a kind of troops
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διμάχαι</span>, who were something intermediate
between cavalry and infantry, being
designed to fight on horseback or on foot, as
circumstances required. It is in the time of
Alexander the Great, that we first meet with
artillery in the train of a Grecian army. His
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balistae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">catapeltae</i> were frequently employed
with great effect, as, for instance, at
the passage of the Jaxartes.</p>

<p>(2) <span id="Exer_r" class="smcap">Roman.</span> <em>General Remarks on the
Legion.</em>&mdash;The name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legio</i> is coeval with the
foundation of Rome, and denoted a body of
troops, which, although subdivided into several
smaller bodies, was regarded as forming
an organised whole. It was not equivalent to
what we call a <em>regiment</em>, inasmuch as it contained
troops of all arms, infantry, cavalry,
and, when military engines were extensively
employed, artillery also; it might thus, so
far, be regarded as a complete <em>army</em>, but on
the other hand the number of soldiers in a
legion was fixed within certain limits, never
much exceeding 6000, and hence when war
was carried on upon a large scale, a single
army, under the command of one general,
frequently contained two, three, or more
legions, besides a large number of auxiliaries
of various denominations. The legion for
many centuries was composed exclusively of
Roman citizens. By the ordinances of Servius
Tullius those alone who were enrolled in
the five classes were eligible, and one of the
greatest changes introduced by Marius (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
107) was the admission of all orders of citizens,
including the lowest, into the ranks.
Up to the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 107, no one was permitted
to serve among the regular troops of the
state, except those who were regarded as
possessing a strong personal interest in the
stability of the commonwealth; but the principle
having been at this period abandoned,
the privilege was extended after the close of
the Social War (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 87) to nearly the whole
of the free population of Italy, and by the
famous edict of Caracalla (or perhaps of M.
Aurelius), to the whole Roman world. Long
before this, however, the legions were raised
chiefly in the provinces; but it does not
appear that the admission of foreigners not
subjects was ever practised upon a large
scale until the reign of the second Claudius
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 268-270), who incorporated a large
body of vanquished Goths, and of Probus
(<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 276-282), who distributed 16,000
Germans among legionary and frontier battalions.
From this time forward what had
originally been the leading characteristic of
the legion was rapidly obliterated, so that
under Diocletian, Constantine, and their successors,
the best soldiers in the Roman armies
were barbarians. The practice of
granting pensions for long service in the
shape of donations of land was first introduced
upon a large scale after the Mithridatic
wars. Hence, when Augustus, in
compliance with the advice of Maecenas,
determined to provide for the security of the
distant provinces, and for tranquil submission
at home by the establishment of a powerful
standing army, he found the public
mind in a great degree prepared for such a
measure, and the distinction between soldier
and civilian unknown, or at least not recognised
before, became from this time forward
as broadly marked as in the most pure military
despotisms of ancient or modern times.
The legions were originally numbered according
to the order in which they were
raised. As they became permanent, the
same numbers remained attached to the same
corps, which were moreover distinguished by
various epithets of which we have early
examples in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legio Martia</i>, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legio
Quinta Alauda</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Alauda">Alauda</a>.</span>] Several legions
bore the same number: thus there were four
<em>Firsts</em>, five <em>Seconds</em>, and five <em>Thirds</em>. The
total number of legions under Augustus was
twenty-five, under Alexander Severus thirty-two,
but during the civil wars the number
was far greater.&mdash;The number of soldiers
who, at different periods, were contained in a
legion, does not appear to have been absolutely
fixed, but to have varied within moderate
limits. Under Romulus the legion
contained 3000 foot soldiers. It is highly
probable that some change may have been
introduced by Servius Tullius, but, in so far
as numbers are concerned, we have no evidence.
From the expulsion of the Kings
until the second year of the second Punic
War, the regular number may be fixed at
4000 or 4200 infantry. From the latter
period until the consulship of Marius the
ordinary number may be fixed at from 5000
to 5200. For some centuries after Marius
the numbers varied from 5000 to 6200, generally
approaching to the higher limit. Amid
all the variations with regard to the infantry,
300 horsemen formed the regular complement
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">justus equitatus</i>) of the legion. When
troops were raised for a service which required
special arrangements, the number of
horsemen was sometimes increased beyond
300. It must be observed, however, that
these remarks with regard to the cavalry
apply only to the period before Marius. We
now proceed to consider the organisation of
the legion at five different periods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p><em>First Period. Servius Tullius.</em> The legion
of Servius is so closely connected with the
Comitia Centuriata that it has already been
discussed in a former article [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Comitia">Comitia</a></span>], and it
is only necessary to repeat here that it was a
phalanx equipped in the Greek fashion, the
front ranks being furnished with a complete
suit of armour, their weapons being long
spears, and their chief defence the round
Argolic shield (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clipeus</i>).</p>

<p><em>Second Period. The Great Latin War</em>,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 340. Our authority for this period is
Livy (viii. 8). The legion in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 340 had
almost entirely discarded the tactics of the
phalanx. It was now drawn up in three, or
perhaps we ought to say, in five lines. The
soldiers of the first line, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hastati</i>, consisted
of youths in the first bloom of manhood
distributed into 15 companies or maniples
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manipuli</i>), a moderate space being left
between each. The maniple contained 60
privates, 2 centurions (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centuriones</i>), and a
standard bearer (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillarius</i>); two-thirds
were heavily armed and bore the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutum</i> or
large oblong shield, the remainder carried
only a spear (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta</i>) and light javelins (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gaesa</i>),
The second line, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principes</i>, was composed
of men in the full vigour of life, divided in
like manner into 15 maniples, all heavily
armed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutati omnes</i>). The two lines of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hastati</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principes</i> taken together
amounted to 30 maniples, and formed the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antepilani</i>. The third line, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triarii</i>, composed
of tried veterans, was also in 15 divisions,
but each of these was triple, containing
3 manipuli, 180 privates, 6 centurions, and 3
vexillarii. In these triple manipuli the veterans
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triarii</i> proper formed the front ranks;
immediately behind them stood the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rorarii</i>,
inferior in age and prowess, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accensi</i>
or supernumeraries, less trustworthy
than either, were posted in the extreme rear.
The battle array may be thus represented.
The fight was commenced by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rorarii</i>, so
called because the light missiles which they
sprinkled among the foe were like the drops
which are the forerunners of the thunder
shower, who, running forwards between the
ranks of the antepilani, acted as tirailleurs;
when they were driven in they returned to
their station behind the triarii, and the battle
began in earnest by the onset of the hastati;
if they were unable to make any impression
they retired between the ranks of the principes,
who now advanced and bore the brunt
of the combat, supported by the hastati, who
had rallied in their rear. If the principes
also failed to make an impression, they retired
through the openings between the
maniples of the triarii, who up to this time
had been crouched on the ground (hence
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subsidiarii</i>), but now arose to make
the last effort (whence the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rem ad
triarios redisse</i>). No longer retaining the
open order of the two first lines, they closed
up their ranks so as to present an unbroken
line of heavy-armed veterans in front, while
the rorarii and accensi, pressing up from
behind, gave weight and consistency to the
mass,&mdash;an arrangement bearing evidence to
a lingering predilection for the principle of
the phalanx, and exhibiting, just as we might
expect at that period, the Roman tactics in
their transition state. It must be observed
that the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordo</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manipulus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum</i>,
although generally kept distinct, are throughout
the chapter used as synonymous. Livy
concludes by saying, that four legions were
commonly levied, each consisting of 5000 infantry
and 300 horse. We must suppose that
he speaks in round numbers in so far as the infantry
are concerned, for according to his own
calculations the numbers will stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Third Period. During the wars of the
younger Scipio.</em> Polybius describes minutely
the method pursued in raising the four
legions during this period. Under ordinary
circumstances they were levied yearly, two
being assigned to each consul. It must be
observed that a regular consular army (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">justus
consularis exercitus</i>) no longer consisted of
Roman legions only, but as Italy became
gradually subjugated, the various states under
the dominion of Rome were bound to furnish
a contingent, and the number of allies (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socii</i>)
usually exceeded that of citizens. They were,
however, kept perfectly distinct, both in the
camp and in the battle field. After the election
of consuls was concluded, the first step
was to choose the 24 chief officers of the
legions, named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni militum</i>. The consuls
then summoned to the Capitol all citizens
eligible for military service. They first
divided the 24 tribunes into 4 parties of 6,
and the tribes were next summoned in succession
by lot. The tribe whose lot came out
first being called up, they picked out from it
four youths, as nearly matched as possible in
age and form; out of these four, the tribunes
of the first legion chose one, the tribunes of
the second legion one of the remaining three;
the tribunes of the third legion, one of the
remaining two, and the last fell to the fourth
legion. Upon the next tribe being called up,
the first choice was given to the tribunes of
the second legion, the second choice to those
of the third, and the last man fell to the first
legion. On the next tribe being called up,
the tribunes of the third legion had the first
choice, and so on in succession, the object in
view being that the four legions should be as
nearly alike as possible, not in the number
only, but in the quality of the soldiers. This
process was continued until the ranks were
complete. In ancient times, the cavalry
were not chosen until after the infantry levy
was concluded, but when Polybius wrote, the
cavalry were picked in the first place from
the list on which they were enrolled by the
censor according to their fortune, and 300
were apportioned to each legion. The levy
being completed, the tribunes collected the
men belonging to their respective legions,
and making one individual stand out from
the rest administered to him an oath
“that he would obey orders and execute to
the best of his ability the command of his
officers.” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sacramento milites adigere s. rogare,
sacramentum s. sacramento dicere.</i>) The
rest of the soldiers then came forward one by
one, and swore to do what the first had
bound himself to perform. At the same time
the consuls gave notice to the magistrates of
those towns in Italy in alliance with Rome,
from whom they desired to receive a contingent,
of the number which each would be
required to furnish, and of the day and place
of gathering. The allied cities levied their
troops and administered the oath much in
the same manner as the Romans, and then
sent them forth after appointing a commander
and a paymaster. The soldiers having again
assembled, the men belonging to each legion
were separated into four divisions. 1. 1000
of the youngest and poorest were set apart
to form the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Velites</i>, the light-armed troops,
or skirmishers of the legion. 2. 1200 who
came next in age (or who were of the same
age with the preceding but more wealthy),
formed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hastati</i>. 3. 1200, consisting of
those in the full vigour of manhood, formed
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principes</i>. 4. 600, consisting of the
oldest and most experienced, formed the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triarii</i>. When the number of soldiers in
the legion exceeded 4000, the first three
divisions were increased proportionally, but
the number of the Triarii remained always
the same. The Hastati, Principes, and Triarii
were each divided into ten companies, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Manipuli</i>. The Velites were not divided
into companies, but were distributed equally
among the Hastati, Principes, and Triarii.
Before the division of the three classes into
maniples, officers were appointed inferior to
the tribunes. 30 men were chosen by merit,
10 from the Hastati, 10 from the Principes,
and 10 from the Triarii; and this first choice
being completed, 30 more in like manner.
These 60 officers, of whom 20 were assigned
to each of the three classes, and distributed
equally among the maniples, were named
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centuriones</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordinum ductores</i>, and each of
the 60 chose for himself a Lieutenant (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">optio</i>),
who, being posted in the rear of the company
while the centurion was at the head, was
named <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐραγός</span> (i.e. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tergiductor</i>) by the
Greeks, so that in each maniple there were
two centurions and two optiones. Further,
the centurions selected out of each maniple
two of the bravest and most vigorous men as
standard bearers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillarii, signiferi</i>). The
first elected centurion of the whole had a
seat in the military council, and in each
maniple the first chosen commanded the
right division of the maniple, and the other
the left. Each of these subdivisions of the
maniple was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centuria</i>. The cavalry
were divided into 10 troops (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">turmae</i>), and
out of each of these 3 officers were chosen,
named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decuriones</i>, who named 3 lieutenants
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">optiones</i>). In each troop the decurio first
chosen commanded the whole troop, and
failing him, the second. The infantry furnished
by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socii</i> was for the most part
equal in number to the Roman legions, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
cavalry twice or thrice as numerous, and the
whole were divided equally between the two
consular armies. Each consul named twelve
superior officers, who were termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praefecti
Sociorum</i>, and corresponded to the legionary
tribunes. A selection was then made of the
best men, to the extent of one-fifth of the
infantry and one-third of the cavalry; these
were formed into a separate corps under the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extraordinarii</i>, and on the march
and in the camp were always near the person
of the consul. The remainder were divided
into two equal portions, and were styled
respectively the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dextera Ala</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sinistra
Ala</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ala_a">Ala</a></span>].&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agmen</i> or <em>Line of March</em>. The
Extraordinarii Pedites led the van followed
by the right wing of the infantry of the allies
and the baggage of these two divisions; next
came one of the Roman legions with its baggage
following; next the other Roman legion
with its own baggage, and that of the left
wing of the allies, who brought up the rear.
The different corps of cavalry sometimes followed
immediately behind the infantry to
which they were attached, sometimes rode on
the flanks of the beasts of burden, at once
protecting them and preventing them from
straggling. Generally, when advancing
through a country in which it was necessary
to guard against a sudden onset, the troops,
instead of proceeding in a loose straggling
column, were kept together in close compact
bodies ready to act in any direction at a
moment’s warning, and hence an army under
these circumstances was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agmine quadrato
incedere</i>. Some doubt exists with regard
to the force of the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agmen Pilatum</i>
as distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agmen Quadratum</i>.
Varro defines the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agmen pilatum</i> as a compact
body marching without beasts of burthen.
Where the phrase occurs in poetry, it
probably denotes merely “columns bristling
with spears.” To the preceding particulars
from Polybius, the following may be added.</p>

<p>1. <em>The levy (delectus.)</em> According to the
principles of the constitution, none were
enrolled in the legion, except freeborn citizens
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingenui</i>) above the age of 17, and
under the age of 60, possessing not less than
4000 asses: but in times of peculiar difficulty,
these conditions were not insisted
upon. In such times all formalities were
dispensed with, and every man capable of
bearing arms was summoned to join in warding
off the threatened danger, a force raised
under such circumstances being termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subitarius</i>
s. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tumultuarius exercitus</i>. If citizens
between the ages of 17 and 46 did not appear
and answer to their names, they might be
punished in various ways,&mdash;by fine, by imprisonment,
by stripes, by confiscation of
their property, and even, in extreme cases,
by being sold as slaves. At the same time,
causes might be alleged which were recognised
as forming a legitimate ground for exemption
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vacatio justa militiae</i>). Thus, all
who had served for the full period of 20
years were relieved from further service,
although they might still be within the regular
age; and so, in like manner, when they
were afflicted by any grievous malady, or
disabled by any personal defect, or engaged
in any sacred or civil offices which required
their constant attendance; but these and
similar pleas, although sustained under ordinary
circumstances, might be rendered void
by a decree of the senate “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne vacationes
valerent</span>.” While those who had served for
the stipulated period were entitled to immunity
for the future, even although within the
legal age, and were styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Emeriti</i>, so on the
other hand, it appears from some passages in
the classics, that persons who had not completed
their regular term within the usual
limits, might be forced, if required, to serve
between the ages of 45 and 50. Towards
the close of the republic, and under the empire,
when the legions became permanent,
the soldier who had served his full time received
a regular discharge (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">missio</i>), together
with a bounty (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praemium</i>) in money or an
allotment of land. The jurists distinguish
three kinds of discharge:&mdash;1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Missio honesta</i>,
granted for length of service. 2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Missio
causaria</i>, in consequence of bad health. 3.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Missio ignominiosa</i>, when a man was drummed
out for bad conduct. It frequently
happened that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emeriti</i> were induced to continue
in the ranks, either from attachment to
the person of the general, or from hopes of
profit or promotion, and were then called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veterani</i>, or when they joined an army, in
consequence of a special invitation, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">evocati</i>.</p>

<p>2. The division of the legion into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohortes</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Manipuli</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centuriae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Signa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ordines</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contubernia</i>.&mdash;(i.)
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohortes.</i> Polybius takes no notice
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohort</i>, a division of the legion often
mentioned in the Roman writers. When the
soldiers of the legion were classified as Velites,
Hastati, Principes and Triarii, the cohort
contained one maniple of each of the
three latter denominations, together with
their complement of Velites, so that when
the legion contained 4000, each cohort would
consist of 60 Triarii, 120 Principes, 120
Hastati, and 100 Velites, in all 400 men.
The number of cohorts in a legion being
always 10, and the cohorts, during the
republic, being all equal to each other, the
strength of the cohort varied from time to
time with the strength of the legion, and
thus at different periods ranged between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
limits of 300 and 600. They were regularly
numbered from 1 to 10, the centurion of the first
century of the first maniple of the first cohort
was the guardian of the eagle, and hence the
first cohort seems always to have been regarded
as superior in dignity to the rest. Late
writers, instead of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cohortes</i>, prefer the somewhat
vague term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">numeri</i>, which appears in
Tacitus and Suetonius, and perhaps even in
Cicero. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Numeri</i> seems to have signified
strictly the muster roll, whence the phrases
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">referre in numeros</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">distribuere in numeros</i>,
and thus served to denote any body of
legionaries. Whenever <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohors</i> occurs in
the Latin classics in connection with the
legion, it always signifies a specific division
of the legion; but it is very frequently found,
in the general sense of <em>battalion</em>, to denote
troops altogether distinct from the legion.&mdash;(ii.)
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Manipulus.</i> The original meaning of
this word, which is derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manus</i>, was
<em>a handful or wisp of hay</em>, <em>straw</em>, <em>fern</em>, <em>or the
like</em>, and this, according to Roman tradition,
affixed to the end of a pole, formed the primitive
military standard in the days of Romulus.
Hence it was applied to a body of
soldiers serving under the same ensign. When
the phalanx was resolved into small companies
marshalled in open order, these were
termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manipuli</i>, and down to a very late
period the common soldiers of the legion
were designated as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manipulares</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manipularii</i>,
terms equivalent to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gregarii milites</i>.
When the phalanx was first broken
up, it appears that each of the three classes
of Hastati, Principes, and Triarii, contained
15 maniples; but before the second
Punic war the number of maniples in
each of these classes was reduced to 10.
Hence it is easy to calculate the number
of soldiers in each maniple, according
to the varying numbers in the legion, it
being always borne in mind that the Triarii
never exceeded 600, and that the Velites
were not divided into maniples, but distributed
equally among the heavy-armed companies.&mdash;(iii.)
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centuriae.</i> The distribution of
soldiers into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centuriae</i> must be regarded as coeval
with the origin of Rome. Plutarch speaks
of the force led by Romulus against Amulius
as formed of centuries; and from the close
connections between the centuries of Servius
Tullius, and the organization of the military
force, we cannot hesitate to believe that the
term was communicated to the ranks of the
phalanx. For a long period after the establishment
of the manipular constitution, the
legion contained 60 centuries.&mdash;(iv.) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Signum.</i>
This word is used to denote a division of the
legion, but it is doubtful whether it signifies a
maniple or a century.&mdash;(v.) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ordo</i> generally
signifies a century, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordinum ductor</i> is synonymous
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centurio</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ducere honestum
ordinem</i> means to be one of the principal
centurions in a legion.&mdash;(vi.) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contubernium.</i>
This was the name given under the empire
to the body of soldiers who were quartered
together in the same tent.</p>

<p>3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hastati</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triarii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pilani</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antepilani</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antesignani</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principia</i>.&mdash;The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hastati</i> were so called, from having been
armed with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principes</i> from having
occupied the front line, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triarii</i>,
otherwise named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pilani</i>, from having been
ranged behind the first two lines as a body
of reserve and armed with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilum</i>, while
the first two lines were termed collectively
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antepilani</i>, from standing in front of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pilani</i>. In process of time, it came to pass,
that these designations no longer expressed
the actual condition of the troops to which
they were attached. When Polybius wrote,
and long before that period, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hastati</i> were
not armed with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hastae</i>, but in common with
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principes</i> bore the heavy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilum</i>: on the
other hand, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilani</i> carried <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hastae</i> and not
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pila</i>, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principes</i> were not drawn up
in the front, but formed the second line.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antesignani</i>.
While the Hastati and Principes,
taken together, were sometimes termed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antepilani</i>, in contradistinction to the Triarii,
so the Hastati alone were sometimes termed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antesignani</i>, in contradistinction to the Principes
and Triarii taken together. The term
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antesignani</i> having become established as
denoting the front ranks in a line of battle,
was retained in this general sense long after
the Hastati, Principes, and Triarii had disappeared.&mdash;Another
term employed to denote
the front ranks of an army in battle array is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principia</i>, and in this sense must be carefully
distinguished from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principia</i> or
chief street in the camp, and from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Principia</i>,
which in the later writers, such as
Ammianus and Vegetius, is equivalent to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">principales milites</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Postsignani</i> does not
occur in any author earlier than Ammianus
Marcellinus, and therefore need not be illustrated
here; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Subsignanus miles</i> of Tacitus
seems to be the same with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vexillarii</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rorarii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accensi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ferentarii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Velites</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Procubitores</i>.&mdash;When the Hastati had, in a
great measure, ceased to act as tirailleurs,
their place was supplied by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rorarii</i>,
whose method of fighting has been described
above (<a href="#Page_165">p. 165</a>). The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accensi</i>, as described by
Livy, were inferior in equipment to the rorarii,
although employed in a similar manner,
and seem to have been camp-followers or
servants, and hence the name is given to
those also who attended upon magistrates or
other officials. At a later period the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accensi</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
were supernumeraries, who served to fill up
any vacancies which occurred in the course
of a campaign. Another ancient term for
light-armed soldiers was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ferentarii</i>. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Velites</i>, called also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Procubitores</i>, because they
were employed on outpost duty when the
Romans were encamped before an enemy,
were first formed into a corps at the siege of
Capua, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 211.</p>

<p>5. <em>Officers of the Legion.</em>&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tribuni Militum</i>
were the chief officers of the legion. Their
number (six) did not vary for many centuries.
They were originally chosen by the commanders-in-chief,
that is, by the kings in the
first instance, and afterwards by the consuls,
or a dictator, as the case might be. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
361 the people assumed to themselves the
right of electing either the whole or a certain
number; and in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 311 it was ordained
that they should choose sixteen for the four
legions. In subsequent times the choice of
the tribunes was divided between the consuls
and the people; but the proportion chosen
by each differed at various periods. No one
was eligible to the office of tribune who had
not served for ten years in the infantry or
five in the cavalry; but this rule admitted
of exceptions. Augustus introduced certain
regulations altogether new. He permitted
the sons of senators to wear the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tunica laticlavia</i>
as soon as they assumed the manly
gown, and to commence their military career
as tribunes, or as commanders (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefecti</i>) of
cavalry. Such persons were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tribuni
Laticlavii</i>.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centuriones.</i> Next in rank to
the Tribunus was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centurio</i>, who, as the
name implies, commanded a century; and
the century, being termed also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordo</i>, the centurions
were frequently designated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordinum
ductores</i> (hence, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adimere ordines</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">offerre ordines</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordines impetrare</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ducere honestum
ordinem</i>, to be one of the principal centurions,
&amp;c.). The chief ordinary duties of
the centurions were to drill the soldiers, to
inspect their arms, clothing, and food, to
watch the execution of the toils imposed, to
visit the centinels, and to regulate the conduct
of their men, both in the camp and in the
field. They also sat as judges in minor offences,
and had the power of inflicting corporal
punishment, whence their badge of office
was a vine sapling, and thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitis</i> is frequently
used to denote the office itself.
Of the two centurions in each maniple the
one first chosen took the command of the
right division, the other of the left. The
century to the right was considered as the
first century of the maniple, and its commander
took precedence probably with the title
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prior</i>, his companion to the left being called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Posterior</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">priores</i> in each of the three
divisions of Triarii, Principes, and Hastati
being the ten centurions first chosen. So
long as these divisions were recognised, all
the centurions of the Triarii appear to have
ranked before those of the Principes, and all
the centurions of the Principes before those
of the Hastati. Moreover, since the maniples
were numbered in each division from 1
to 10, there was probably a regular progression
from the first centurion of the first
maniple down to the second centurion of the
tenth maniple. The first centurion of the
first maniple of the Triarii, originally named
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centurio Primus</i>, and afterwards <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centurio
Primipili</i>, or simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primipilus</i>, occupied a
very conspicuous position. He stood next
in rank to the Tribuni militum; he had a
seat in the military council; to his charge
was committed the eagle of the legion, whence
he is sometimes styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquilifer</i>, and, under
the empire at least, his office was very lucrative.
A series of terms connected with these
arrangements are furnished by the narrative
which Sp. Ligustinus gives of his own career
(Liv. xlii. 34). He thus enumerates the
various steps of his promotion:&mdash;“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mihi T.
Quinctius Flamininus <em>decumum ordinem hastatum</em>
adsignavit ... me imperator dignum
judicavit cui <em>primum hastatum prioris centuriae</em>
adsignaret ... a M’. Acilio mihi <em>primus
princeps prioris centuriae</em> est adsignatus ... quater
intra paucos annos <em>primum pilum
duxi</em></span>.” The gradual ascent from the ranks
being to the post of centurion:&mdash;1. In the
tenth maniple of the Hastati. 2. In the first
century of the first maniple of the Hastati.
3. In the first century of the first maniple of
the Principes. 4. In the first century of the
first maniple of the Triarii.&mdash;But even after
the distinction between Hastati, Principes,
and Triarii was altogether abolished, and
they were all blended together in the cohorts,
the same nomenclature with regard to the
centuries and their commanders was retained,
although it is by no means easy to perceive
how it was applied. That great differences
of rank existed among the centurions is evident
from the phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primores centurionum</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primi ordines</i> (<em>i.e.</em> chief centurions), as opposed
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inferiores ordines</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infimi ordines</i>,
and that promotion from a lower to a higher
grade frequently took place, is evident from
many passages in ancient authors. The
election of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">optiones</i>, or lieutenants, by the
centurions, has been already described.</p>

<p><em>Fourth Period. From the times of the Gracchi
until the downfall of the Republic.</em> After
the times of the Gracchi the following changes
in military affairs may be noticed:&mdash;In the
first consulship of Marius the legions were
thrown open to citizens of all grades, without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
distinction of fortune. The whole of the
legionaries were armed and equipped in the
same manner, all being now furnished with
the pilum; and hence we see in Tacitus the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pila</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gladii</i> of the legionaries, opposed to
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hastae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spathae</i> of the auxiliaries.
The legionaries when in battle order were no
longer arranged in three lines, each consisting
of ten maniples, with an open space between
each maniple, but in two lines, each
consisting of five cohorts, with a space between
each cohort. The younger soldiers
were no longer placed in the front, but in
reserve, the van being composed of veterans,
as may be seen from various passages in
Caesar. As a necessary result of the above
arrangements, the distinction between Hastati,
Principes, and Triarii ceased to exist.
These names, as applied to particular classes
of soldiers, are not found in Caesar, in Tacitus,
nor in any writer upon military affairs
after the time of Marius. The Velites disappeared.
The skirmishers, included under
the general term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">levis armatura</i>, consisted
for the most part of foreign mercenaries possessing
peculiar skill in the use of some national
weapon, such as the Balearic slingers,
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funditores</i>), the Cretan archers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sagittarii</i>),
and the Moorish dartmen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jaculatores</i>).
Troops of this description had, it is true,
been employed by the Romans even before
the second Punic war, and were denominated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">levium armatorum</i> (s. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">armorum</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auxilia</i>; but
now the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">levis armatura</i> consisted exclusively
of foreigners, were formed into a regular
corps under their own officers, and no longer
entered into the constitution of the legion.
When operations requiring great activity
were undertaken, such as could not be performed
by mere skirmishers, detachments of
legionaries were lightly equipped, and marched
without baggage, for these special services;
and hence the frequent occurrence of such
phrases as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">expediti</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">expediti milites</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">expeditae
cohortes</i>, and even <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">expeditae legiones</i>. The
cavalry of the legion underwent a change in
every respect analogous to that which took
place in regard of the light-armed troops. It
is evident, from the history of Caesar’s campaigns
in Gaul, that the number of Roman
equites attached to his army was very small,
and that they were chiefly employed as aides-de-camp,
and on confidential missions. The
bulk of Caesar’s cavalry consisted of foreigners,
a fact which becomes strikingly apparent
when we read that Ariovistus having stipulated
that the Roman general should come
to their conference attended by cavalry alone,
Caesar, feeling no confidence in his Gaulish
horse, dismounted them, and supplied their
place by soldiers of the tenth legion. In
like manner they ceased to form part of the
legion, and from this time forward we find
the legions and the cavalry spoken of as
completely distinct from each other. After
the termination of the Social War, when
most of the inhabitants of Italy became
Roman citizens, the ancient distinction between
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legiones</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socii</i> disappeared,
and all who had served as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socii</i> became incorporated
with the legiones. An army
during the last years of the republic and
under the earlier emperors consisted of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romanae
Legiones et Auxilia s. Auxiliares</i>, the
latter term comprehending troops of all
kinds, except the legions. Whenever the
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socii</i> is applied to troops after the date
of the Social War, it is generally to be regarded
as equivalent to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auxiliares</i>. But the
most important change of all was the establishment
of the military <em>profession</em>, and the
distinction now first introduced between the
civilian and the soldier.</p>

<p><em>Fifth Period. From the establishment of
the empire until the age of the Antonines</em>, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
31&ndash;<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 150. Under the empire a regular
army consisted of a certain number of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legiones</i>
and of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Supplementa</i>, the Supplementa
being again divided into the imperial guards,
which appear under several different forms,
distinguished by different names; and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Auxilia</i>, which were subdivided into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sociae
Cohortes</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nationes</i>, the latter being for
the most part barbarians. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legiones</i>, as
already remarked, although still composed of
persons who enjoyed the privileges of Roman
citizens, were now raised almost exclusively
in the provinces. The legion was divided
into 10 cohorts, and each cohort into 6 centuries;
the first cohort, which had the custody
of the eagle, was double the size of the
others, and contained 960 men, the remaining
cohorts contained each 480 men; and
consequently each ordinary century 80 men,
the total strength of the legion being thus
5280 men.&mdash;It is during this period that we
first meet with the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vexillarii</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vexilla</i>,
which occurs repeatedly in Tacitus. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillarii</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexilla legionum</i>, were those
soldiers who, after having served in the
legion for sixteen years, became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exauctorati</i>,
but continued to serve in company with that
legion, under a vexillum of their own, until
they received their full discharge. The
number attached to each legion was usually
about five or six hundred.&mdash;The term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exauctorare</i>
also meant <em>to discharge from military
service</em>, but does not appear to have been in
use before the Augustan period. It signified
both a simple discharge, and a cashiering on
account of some crime. During the later
period of the empire the latter signification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
began almost exclusively to prevail.&mdash;As
to the Praetorian troops, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Praetoriani">Praetoriani</a></span>.&mdash;From
the time when the cavalry were separated
from the legion they were formed into
bodies called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alae</i>, which varied in number
according to circumstances. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alae</i> were
raised in the Roman provinces and consisted,
probably, for the most part, of citizens, or at
least subjects. But in addition to these every
army at this period was attended by squadrons
of light horse composed entirely of barbarians;
and the chief duty performed by
those named above was guiding the pioneers
as they performed their labours in advance
of the army.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohortes peditatae</i>, were battalions
raised chiefly in the provinces, composed
of Roman citizens, of subjects and
allies, or of citizens, allies, and subjects
indiscriminately. To this class of troops
belonged the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cohortes auxiliares</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auxilia
cohortium</i>, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sociorum cohortes</i>, of whom
we read in Tacitus, together with a multitude
of others recorded in inscriptions and named
for the most part from the nations of which
they were composed. These cohorts were
numbered regularly like the legions.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohortes
Equitatae</i> differed from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peditatae</i>
in this only, that they were made up of infantry
combined with cavalry.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Classici</i>,
which we may fairly render <em>Marines</em>, were
employed, according to Hyginus, as pioneers.
They corresponded to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Navales Socii</i>, under
the republic, who were always regarded
as inferior to regular soldiers. After the
establishment by Augustus of regular permanent
fleets at Misenum, Ravenna, and on the
coast of Gaul, a large body of men must have
been required to man them, who were sometimes
called upon to serve as ordinary soldiers.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nationes</i>
were battalions composed entirely
of barbarians, or of the most uncivilised
among the subjects of Rome, and were probably
chiefly employed upon outpost duties.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Urbanae
Cohortes.</i> Augustus, in addition
to the praetorian cohorts, instituted a force
of city guards, amounting to 6000 men divided
into four battalions. They are usually
distinguished as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohortes Urbanae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Urbana
militia</i>, their quarters, which were within
the city, being the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Urbana Castra</i>.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohortes
Vigilum.</i> Augustus also organised a large
body of night-watchers, whose chief duty was
to act as firemen. They were divided into
seven cohorts, in the proportion of one cohort
to each two <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regiones</i>, were stationed in
fourteen guardhouses (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excubitoria</i>), and called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cohortes Vigilum</i>. They were commanded
by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praefectus</i>, who was of equestrian
rank.</p>

This oath was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξωμοσία</span>, and the

<p id="Exsilium">EXSĬLĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυγή</span>), banishment. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>
Banishment among the Greek states seldom,
if ever, appears as a punishment appointed
by law for particular offences. We
might, indeed, expect this, for the division of
Greece into a number of independent states
would neither admit of the establishment of
penal colonies, as among us, nor of the various
kinds of exile which we read of under
the Roman emperors. The general term
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυγή</span> (flight) was for the most part applied
in the case of those who, in order to avoid
some punishment or danger, removed from
their own country to another. At Athens it
took place chiefly in cases of homicide, or
murder. An action for wilful murder was
brought before the Areiopagus, and for manslaughter
before the court of the Ephetae.
The accused might, in either case, withdraw
himself (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φεύγειν</span>) before sentence was passed;
but when a criminal evaded the punishment
to which an act of murder would have exposed
him had he remained in his own
land, he was then banished for ever (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φεύγει
ἀειφυγίαν</span>), and not allowed to return home
even when other exiles were restored upon a
general amnesty. Demosthenes says, that
the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φεύγειν</span> was properly applied to the
exile of those who committed murder with
malice aforethought, whereas the term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεθίστασθαι</span>
was used where the act was not intentional.
The property also was confiscated
in the former case, but not in the latter.
When a verdict of manslaughter was returned,
it was usual for the convicted party
to leave his country by a certain road, and
to remain in exile till he induced some one
of the relatives of the slain man to take compassion
on him. We are not informed what
were the consequences if the relatives of the
slain man refused to make a reconciliation;
supposing that there was no compulsion, it
is reasonable to conclude that the exile was
allowed to return after a fixed time. Plato,
who is believed to have copied many of his
laws from the constitution of Athens, fixes
the period of banishment for manslaughter at
one year.&mdash;Under <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυγή</span>, or banishment, as a
general term, is comprehended <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostracism</i>, (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀστρακισμός</span>).
Those that were ostracised did
not lose their property, and the time, as well
as place of their banishment, was fixed.
This ostracism is supposed by some to have
been instituted by Cleisthenes, after the expulsion
of the Peisistratidae; its nature and
object are thus explained by Aristotle:&mdash;“Democratical
states (he observes) used to
ostracise, and remove from the city for a definite
time, those who appeared to be preeminent
above their fellow-citizens, by reason
of their wealth, the number of their
friends, or any other means of influence.”
Ostracism, therefore, was not a punishment
for any crime, but rather a precautionary removal
of those who possessed sufficient power
in the state to excite either envy or fear.
Thus Plutarch says, it was a good-natured
way of allaying envy by the humiliation of
superior dignity and power. The manner of
effecting it at Athens was as follows:&mdash;A
space in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agora</i> was enclosed by barriers,
with ten entrances for the ten tribes. By
these the tribesmen entered, each with his
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostracon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄστρακον</span>), or piece of tile (whence
the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostracism</i>), on which was written
the name of the individual whom he wished
to be ostracised. The nine archons and the
senate, <em>i.e.</em> the presidents of that body, superintended
the proceedings, and the party
who had the greatest number of votes against
him, supposing that this number amounted
to 6000, was obliged to withdraw (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεταστῆναι</span>)
from the city within ten days; if the
number of votes did not amount to 6000, nothing
was done. Some of the most distinguished
men at Athens were removed by
ostracism, but recalled when the city found
their services indispensable. Among these
were Themistocles, Aristeides, and Cimon, son
of Miltiades. The last person against whom it
was used at Athens was Hyperbolus, a demagogue
of low birth and character; but the
Athenians thought their own dignity compromised,
and ostracism degraded by such an
application of it, and accordingly discontinued
the practice.&mdash;From the ostracism of Athens
was copied the <em>Petalism</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεταλισμός</span>) of the
Syracusans, so called from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέταλον</span>, or
leaf of the olive, on which was written the
name of the person whom they wished to remove
from the city. The removal, however,
was only for five years; a sufficient time, as
they thought, to humble the pride and hopes
of the exile. In connection with petalism it
may be remarked, that if any one were
falsely registered in a demus, or ward, at
Athens, his expulsion was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκφυλλοφορία</span>,
from the votes being given by leaves.
Besides those exiled by law, or ostracised,
there was frequently a great number of political
exiles in Greece; men who, having
distinguished themselves as the leaders of
one party, were expelled, or obliged to remove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
from their native city, when the opposite
faction became predominant. They are
spoken of as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ φεύγοντες</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἐκπεσόντες</span>, and
as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ κατελθόντες</span> after their return (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡ κάθοδος</span>)
the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατάγειν</span> being applied to those who
were instrumental in effecting it.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span>
Banishment as a punishment did not
exist in the old Roman state. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquae et
ignis interdictio</i>, which we so frequently read
of in the republican period, was in reality
not banishment, for it was only a ban, pronounced
by the people (by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex</i>), or by a
magistrate in a criminal court, by which a
person was deprived of water and of fire;
that is, of the first necessaries of life; and
its effect was to incapacitate a person from
exercising the rights of a citizen; in other
words, to deprive him of his citizenship.
Such a person might, if he chose, remain at
Rome, and submit to the penalty of being an
outcast, incapacitated from doing any legal
act, and liable to be killed by any one with
impunity. To avoid these dangers, a person
suffering under such an interdict would naturally
withdraw from Rome, and in the
earlier republican period, if he withdrew to
a state between which and Rome isopolitical
relations existed, he would become a citizen
of that state. This right was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus
exsulandi</i> with reference to the state to which
the person came; with respect to his own
state, which he left, he was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsul</i>, and his
condition was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsilium</i>; and with respect to
the state which he entered, he was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inquilinus</i>.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
In the same way a citizen of such a
state had a right of going into exsilium at
Rome; and at Rome he might attach himself
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">applicare se</i>) to a quasi-patronus. Exsilium,
instead of being a punishment, would thus
rather be a mode of evading punishment;
but towards the end of the republic the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquae et ignis interdictio</i> became a regular
banishment, since the sentence usually specified
certain limits, within which a person was
interdicted from fire and water. Thus Cicero
was interdicted from fire and water
within 400 miles from the city. The punishment
was inflicted for various crimes, as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis publica</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peculatus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veneficium</i>, &amp;c. Under
the empire there were two kinds of exsilium;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsilium</i> properly so called, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relegatio</i>;
the great distinction between the two
was, that the former deprived a person of his
citizenship, while the latter did not. The
distinction between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsilium</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relegatio</i>
existed under the republic. Ovid also describes
himself, not as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsul</i>, which he considers
a term of reproach, but as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relegatus</i>.
The chief species of exsilium was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deportatio
in insulam</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deportatio</i> simply, which
was introduced under the emperors in place
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquae et ignis interdictio</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relegatio</i>
merely confined the person within, or
excluded him from particular places. In the
latter case it was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuga lata</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuga libera</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liberum exsilium</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relegatus</i>
went into banishment; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deportatus</i> was
conducted to his place of banishment, sometimes
in chains.</p>

<p id="Familia">FĂMĬLĬA. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia</i> contains
the same element as the word famulus, a
slave, and the verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">famulari</i>. In its widest
sense it signifies the totality of that which belongs
to a Roman citizen who is sui juris,
and therefore a paterfamilias. Thus, in certain
cases of testamentary disposition, the
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia</i> is explained by the equivalent
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patrimonium</i>; and the person who received
the familia from the testator was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familiae
emptor</i>. But the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia</i> is
sometimes limited to signify “persons,” that
is, all those who are in the power of a paterfamilias,
such as his sons (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filii-familias</i>),
daughters, grandchildren, and slaves. Sometimes
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia</i> is used to signify the slaves belonging
to a person, or to a body of persons
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">societas</i>).</p>

<p id="Fasces">FASCES, rods bound in the form of a
bundle, and containing an axe (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">securis</i>) in
the middle, the iron of which projected from
them. They were usually made of birch,
but sometimes also of the twigs of the elm.
They are said to have been derived from Vetulonia,
a city of Etruria. Twelve were carried
before each of the kings by twelve lictors;
and on the expulsion of the Tarquins,
one of the consuls was preceded by twelve
lictors with the fasces and secures, and the
other by the same number of lictors with the
fasces only, or, according to some accounts,
with crowns around them. But P. Valerius
Publicola, who gave to the people the right
of provocatio, ordained that the secures
should be removed from the fasces, and allowed
only one of the consuls to be preceded
by the lictors while they were at Rome.
The other consul was attended only by a single
accensus [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Accensus">Accensus</a></span>]. When they were
out of Rome, and at the head of the army, each
of the consuls retained the axe in the fasces,
and was preceded by his own lictors, as before
the time of Valerius. The fasces and
secures were, however, carried before the
dictator even in the city, and he was also
preceded by twenty-four lictors, and the magister
equitum by six. The praetors were
preceded in the city by two lictors with the
fasces; but out of Rome and at the head of
an army by six, with the fasces and secures.
The tribunes of the plebs, the aediles and
quaestors, had no lictors in the city, but in
the provinces the quaestors were permitted to
have the fasces. The lictors carried the
fasces on their shoulders; and when an inferior
magistrate met one who was higher in
rank, the lictors lowered their fasces to him.
This was done by Valerius Publicola, when
he addressed the people, and hence came
the expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">submittere fasces</i> in the sense
of to yield, to confess one’s self inferior to
another. When a general had gained a victory,
and had been saluted as Imperator by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
his soldiers, he usually crowned his fasces
with laurel.</p>

<p id="Fasti">FASTI. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fas</i> signifies <em>divine law</em>: the epithet
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fastus</i> is properly applied to anything
in accordance with divine law; and hence
those days upon which legal business might,
without impiety (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine piaculo</i>), be transacted
before the praetor, were technically denominated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasti dies</i>, i.e. <em>lawful days</em>. The sacred
books in which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasti dies</i> of the year
were marked were themselves denominated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasti</i>; the term, however, was employed to
denote registers of various descriptions. Of
these the two principal are the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti Sacri</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti Kalendares</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti Annales</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti
Historici</i>.&mdash;I. <span class="smcap">Fasti Sacri</span> or <span class="smcap">Kalendares</span>.
For nearly four centuries and a half after the
foundation of the city a knowledge of the
calendar was possessed exclusively by the
priests. One of the pontifices regularly proclaimed
the appearance of the new moon,
and at the same time announced the period
which would intervene between the Kalends
and the Nones. On the Nones the country
people assembled for the purpose of learning
from the rex sacrorum the various festivals
to be celebrated during the month, and the
days on which they would fall. In like
manner all who wished to go to law were
obliged to inquire of the privileged few on
what day they might bring their suit, and
received the reply as if from the lips of an
astrologer. The whole of this lore, so long
a source of power and profit, and therefore
jealously enveloped in mystery, was at length
made public by a certain Cn. Flavius, scribe
to App. Claudius; who, having gained access
to the pontifical books, copied out all the
requisite information, and exhibited it in the
forum for the use of the people at large.
From this time forward such tables became
common, and were known by the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti</i>. They usually contained an enumeration
of the months and days of the year; the
Nones, Ides, Nundinae, Dies Fasti, Nefasti,
Comitiales, Atri, &amp;c., together with the different
festivals, were marked in their proper
places: astronomical observations on the
risings and settings of the fixed stars, and the
commencement of the seasons were frequently
inserted. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Calendarium">Calendarium</a>; <a href="#Dies">Dies</a>.</span>]&mdash;II. <span class="smcap">Fasti
Annales</span> or <span class="smcap">Historici</span>. Chronicles such as
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annales Maximi</i>, containing the names of
the chief magistrates for each year, and a
short account of the most remarkable events
noted down opposite to the days on which
they occurred, were, from the resemblance
which they bore in arrangement to the
sacred calendars, denominated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasti</i>; and
hence this word is used, especially by the
poets, in the general sense of <em>historical records</em>.
In prose writers <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasti</i> is commonly
employed as the technical term for the registers
of consuls, dictators, censors, and other
magistrates, which formed part of the public
archives. Some most important <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasti</i> belonging
to this class, executed probably at the
beginning of the reign of Tiberius, have been
partially preserved, and are deposited in the
Capitol in Rome, where they are known by
the name of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti Capitolini</i>.</p>


<p id="Fastigium">FASTĬGĬUM. An ancient Greek or Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
temple, of rectangular construction, is
terminated at its upper extremity by a triangular
figure, both in front and rear, which
rests upon the cornice of the entablature as
a base, and has its sides formed by the cornices
which terminate the roof. The whole
of this triangle above the trabeation is implied
in the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fastigium</i>, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀέτωμα</span>
by the Greeks, pediment by our architects.
The dwelling-houses of the Romans had no
gable ends; consequently when the word is
applied to them, it is not in its strictly technical
sense, but designates the roof simply,
and is to be understood of one which rises
to an apex, as distinguished from a flat one.
The fastigium, properly so called, was appropriated
to the temples of the gods; therefore,
when the Romans began to bestow divine
honours upon Julius Caesar, amongst
other privileges which they decreed to him,
was the liberty of erecting a fastigium to his
house, that is, a portico and pediment towards
the street, like that of a temple.</p>

<p id="Fax">FAX (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φανός</span>), a torch. As the principal
use of torches was to give light to those who
went abroad after sunset, the portion of the
Roman day immediately succeeding sun-set
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fax</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima fax</i>. The use of
torches after sun-set, and the practice of celebrating
marriages at that time, probably led
to the consideration of the torch as one of
the necessary accompaniments and symbols
of marriage. Among the Romans the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fax
nuptialis</i> having been lighted at the parental
hearth, was carried before the bride by a boy
whose parents were alive. The torch was also
carried at funerals (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fax sepulchralis</i>), both because
these were often nocturnal ceremonies,
and because it was used to set fire to the pile.</p>

<p id="Fenus">FĒNUS or FOENUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόκος</span>), interest of
money.&mdash;(1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span> At Athens there was
no restriction upon the rate of interest. A
rate might be expressed or represented in
two different ways: (1.) by the number of

annually or for the whole period of the loan.

generally used when money was lent upon
real security (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόκοι ἔγγυοι</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγγειοι</span>), different
rates were expressed as follows:&mdash;10
per cent. by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ πέντε ὀβολοῖς</span>, <em>i.e.</em> 5 oboli per

<p>Another method was generally adopted in
cases of bottomry (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ ναυτικόν</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόκοι ναυτικοί</span>,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔκδοσις</span>), where money was lent upon
the ship’s cargo or freightage (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ τῷ ναύλῳ</span>),
or the ship itself, for a specified time, commonly
that of the voyage. By this method
the following rates were thus represented:&mdash;10
per cent. by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόκοι ἐπιδέκατοι</span>, i.e. interest
at the rate of a tenth; 12½, 16⅔, 20, 33⅓,
by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόκοι ἐπόγδοοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφεκτοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίπεμπτοι</span>, and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτριτοι</span>, respectively. The usual rates of
interest at Athens about the time of Demosthenes
varied from 12 to 18 per cent.&mdash;(2)
<span class="smcap">Roman.</span> Towards the close of the republic,

was the legal rate of interest. The interest

hence the phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tristes</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">celeres calendae</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calendarium</i>, the latter meaning a debt-book

<p>Instead of the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">asses usurae</i>, a synonyme
was used, viz. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centesimae usurae</i>, inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
as at this rate of interest there was
paid in a hundred months a sum equal to the
whole principal. Hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">binae centesimae</i> =
24 per cent., and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quaternae centesimae</i> =
48 per cent. The monthly rate of the centesimae
was of foreign origin, and first
adopted at Rome in the time of Sulla. The
old <em>yearly</em> rate established by the Twelve
Tables (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 450) was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unciarium fenus</i>.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uncia</i> was the twelfth part of the as,
and since the full (12 oz.) copper coinage was
still in use at Rome when the Twelve Tables
became law, the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unciarium</i> fenus
would be a natural expression for interest of
one ounce in the pound; <em>i.e.</em> a twelfth part
of the sum borrowed, or 8⅓ per cent., not per
month, but per year. This rate, if calculated
for the old Roman year of ten months, would
give 10 per cent. for the civil year of twelve
months, which was in common use in the
time of the decemvirs. If a debtor could
not pay the principal and interest at the end
of the year, he used to borrow money from a
fresh creditor, to pay off his old debt. This
proceeding was very frequent, and called a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versura</i>. It amounted to little short of paying
compound interest, or an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anatocismus
anniversarius</i>, another phrase for which was
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usurae renovatae</i>; <em>e.g.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centesimae renovatae</i>
is 12 per cent. compound interest, to which
Cicero opposes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centesimae perpetuo fenore</i> =
12 per cent. simple interest. The following
phrases are of common occurrence in connection
with borrowing and lending money
at interest:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pecuniam apud aliquem collocare</i>,
to lend money at interest; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relegere</i>, to
call it in again; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavere</i>, to give security for
it; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opponere</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opponere pignori</i>, to give as a
pledge or mortgage. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i> is
also of extensive use in money transactions.
Properly it denoted the name of a debtor,
registered in a banker’s or any other account-book:
hence it came to signify the articles of
an account, a debtor, or a debt itself. Thus
we have <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonum nomen</i>, a good debt; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomina
facere</i>, to lend monies, and also to borrow
money.</p>

<p id="Ferculum">FERCŬLUM (from <em>fer-o</em>) is applied to any

tray or frame on which several dishes were
brought in at once at dinner; and hence
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fercula</i> came to mean the number of courses
at dinner, and even the dishes themselves.
The ferculum was also used for carrying the
images of the gods in the procession of the
circus, the ashes of the dead in a funeral,
and the spoils in a triumph; in all which
cases it appears to have been carried on the
shoulders or in the hands of men.</p>


<p id="Feretrum">FĔRĔTRUM. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Feriae">FĒRĬAE, holidays, were, generally speaking,
days or seasons during which free-born
Romans suspended their political transactions
and their law-suits, and during which slaves
enjoyed a cessation from labour. All feriae
were thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies nefasti</i>. The feriae included
all days consecrated to any deity; consequently
all days on which public festivals
were celebrated were feriae or dies feriati.
But some of them, such as the feria vindemialis,
and the feriae aestivae, seem to have
had no direct connection with the worship
of the gods. The nundinae, however, during
the time of the kings and the early period of
the republic, were feriae only for the populus,
and days of business for the plebeians,
until, by the Hortensian law, they became
fasti or days of business for both orders. All
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriae publicae</i>, <em>i.e.</em> those which were observed
by the whole nation, were divided
into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriae stativae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriae conceptivae</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feriae imperativae</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Feriae stativae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">statae</i>
were those which were held regularly, and
on certain days marked in the calendar. To
these belonged some of the great festivals,
such as the Agonalia, Carmentalia, Lupercalia,
&amp;c. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Feriae conceptivae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conceptae</i>
were held every year, but not on certain or
fixed days, the time being every year appointed
by the magistrates or priests. Among
these we may mention the feriae Latinae,
feriae Sementivae, Paganalia, and Compitalia.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Feriae imperativae</i> were those which
were held on certain emergencies at the
command of the consuls, praetors, or of a
dictator. The manner in which all public
feriae were kept bears great analogy to the
observance of our Sunday. The people visited
the temples of the gods, and offered up their
prayers and sacrifices. The most serious and
solemn seem to have been the feriae imperativae,
but all the others were generally attended
with rejoicings and feasting. All
kinds of business, especially law-suits, were
suspended during the public feriae, as they
were considered to pollute the sacred season.
The most important of the holidays designated
by the name of feriae, are the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Feriae Latinae</i>,
or simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latinae</i> (the original name was
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latiar</i>), which were said to have been instituted
by the last Tarquin in commemoration
of the alliance between the Romans and Latins.
This festival, however, was of much
higher antiquity; it was a panegyris, or a
festival, of the whole Latin nation, celebrated
on the Alban mount; and all that the last
Tarquin did was to convert the original Latin
festival into a Roman one, and to make
it the means of hallowing and cementing the
alliance between the two nations. Before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
the union, the chief magistrate of the Latins
had presided at the festival; but Tarquin
now assumed this distinction, which subsequently,
after the destruction of the Latin
commonwealth, remained with the chief
magistrates of Rome. The object of this
panegyris on the Alban mount was the worship
of Jupiter Latiaris, and, at least as long
as the Latin republic existed, to deliberate
and decide on matters of the confederacy,
and to settle any disputes which might have
arisen among its members. As the feriae
Latinae belonged to the conceptivae, the
time of their celebration greatly depended on
the state of affairs at Rome, since the consuls
were never allowed to take the field until
they had held the Latinae. This festival
was a great engine in the hands of the magistrates,
who had to appoint the time of its
celebration (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">concipere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edicere</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">indicere
Latinas</i>); as it might often suit their purpose
either to hold the festival at a particular
time or to delay it, in order to prevent or
delay such public proceedings as seemed
injurious and pernicious, and to promote
others to which they were favourably disposed.
The festival lasted six days.</p>


<p id="Fescennina">FESCENNINA, scil. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carmina</i>, one of the
earliest kinds of Italian poetry, which consisted
of rude and jocose verses, or rather
dialogues of extempore verses, in which the
merry country folks assailed and ridiculed
one another. This amusement seems originally
to have been peculiar to country people,
but it was also introduced into the towns
of Italy and at Rome, where we find it mentioned
as one of those in which young people
indulged at weddings.</p>


<p id="Fetiales">FĒTĬĀLES or FĒCĬĀLES, a college of
Roman priests, who acted as the guardians
of the public faith. It was their province,
when any dispute arose with a foreign state,
to demand satisfaction, to determine the circumstances
under which hostilities might be
commenced, to perform the various religious
rites attendant on the solemn declaration of
war, and to preside at the formal ratification
of peace. When an injury had been received
from a foreign state, four fetiales were deputed
to seek redress, who again elected one
of their number to act as their representative.
This individual was styled the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater patratus
populi Romani</i>. A fillet of white wool was
bound round his head, together with a wreath
of sacred herbs gathered within the inclosure
of the Capitoline hill (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verbenae</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sagmina</i>),
whence he was sometimes named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verbenarius</i>.
Thus equipped, he proceeded to the confines
of the offending tribe, where he halted, and
addressed a prayer to Jupiter, calling the
god to witness, with heavy imprecations, that
his complaints were well founded and his
demands reasonable. He then crossed the
border, and the same form was repeated in
nearly the same words to the first native of
the soil whom he might chance to meet;
again a third time to the sentinel or any
citizen whom he encountered at the gate of
the chief town; and a fourth time to the
magistrates in the forum in presence of the
people. If a satisfactory answer was not
returned within thirty days, after publicly
delivering a solemn denunciation of what
might be expected to follow, he returned to
Rome, and, accompanied by the rest of the
fetiales, made a report of his mission to the
senate. If the people, as well as the senate,
decided for war, the pater patratus again set
forth to the border of the hostile territory,
and launched a spear tipped with iron, or
charred at the extremity and smeared with
blood (emblematic doubtless of fire and
slaughter), across the boundary, pronouncing
at the same time a solemn declaration of war.
The demand for redress, and the proclamation
of hostilities, were alike termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clarigatio</i>.
The whole system is said to have
been borrowed from the Aequicolae or the
Ardeates, and similar usages undoubtedly
prevailed among the Latin states. The number
of the fetiales cannot be ascertained with
certainty, but they were probably twenty.
They were originally selected from the most
noble families, and their office lasted for life.</p>

earthenware, a vessel or other article
made of baked clay. The instruments
used in pottery (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars figulina</i>) were the following:&mdash;1.
The wheel (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροχός</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">orbis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rota</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rota figularis</i>). 2. Pieces of wood or bone,
which the potter (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεραμεύς</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">figulus</i>) held in
his right hand, and applied occasionally to
the surface of the clay during its revolution.
3. <span id="Forma">Moulds</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">formae</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύποι</span>), used either to
decorate with figures in relief vessels which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
had been thrown on the wheel, or to produce
foliage, animals, or any other appearances,
on Antefixa, on cornices of terra cotta, and
imitative or ornamental pottery of all other
kinds, in which the wheel was not adapted
to give the first shape. 4. Gravers or scalpels,
used by skilful modellers in giving to
figures of all kinds a more perfect finish and
a higher relief than could be produced by the
use of moulds. The earth used for making
pottery (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεράμικη γῆ</span>), was commonly red, and
often of so lively a colour as to resemble
coral. Other pottery is brown or cream-coloured,
and sometimes white. Some of the
ancient earthenware is throughout its substance
black, an effect produced by mixing the
earth with comminuted asphaltum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gagates</i>),
or with some other bituminous or oleaginous
substance. It appears also that asphaltum,
with pitch and tar, both mineral and vegetable,
was used to cover the surface like a
varnish. The best pottery was manufactured
at Athens, in the island of Samos, and in
Etruria. A quarter of Athens was called
Cerameicus, because it was inhabited by
potters. Vessels, before being sent for the
last time to the furnace, were sometimes immersed
in that finely prepared mud, now
technically called “slip,” by which the surface
is both smoothed and glazed, and at the
same time receives a fresh colour. Ruddle,
or red ochre (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίλτος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rubrica</i>), was principally
employed for this purpose. To produce
a further variety in the paintings upon vases
the artists employed a few brightly coloured
earths and metallic ores. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pictura">Pictura</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Fideicommissum">FĬDEICOMMISSUM may be defined to be
a testamentary disposition, by which a person
who gives a thing to another imposes on him
the obligation of transferring it to a third
person. The obligation was not created by
words of legal binding force (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civilia verba</i>),
but by words of request (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">precativè</i>), such as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fideicommitto</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peto</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">volo dari</i>, and the like;
which were the operative words (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verba utilia</i>).</p>


<p id="Fiducia">FĪDŪCĬA. If a man transferred his property
to another, on condition that it should
be restored to him, this contract was called
Fiducia, and the person to whom the property
was so transferred was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fiduciam
accipere</i>. The trustee was bound to discharge
his trust by restoring the thing: if he did
not, he was liable to an actio fiduciae or fiduciaria,
which was an actio bonae fidei. If
the trustee was condemned in the action, the
consequence was infamia.</p>


<p id="Fiscus">FISCUS, the imperial treasury. Under
the republic the public treasury was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aerarium</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aerarium">Aerarium</a>.</span>] On the establishment
of the imperial power, there was a
division of the provinces between the senate,
as the representative of the old republic, and
the Caesar or emperor; and there was consequently
a division of the most important
branches of public income and expenditure.
The property of the senate retained the name
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aerarium</i>, and that of the Caesar, as such,
received the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fiscus</i>. The private
property of the Caesar (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res privata principis,
ratio Caesaris</i>) was quite distinct from that
of the fiscus. The word fiscus signified a
wicker-basket, or pannier, in which the Romans
were accustomed to keep and carry
about large sums of money; and hence fiscus
came to signify any person’s treasure or
money chest. The importance of the imperial
fiscus soon led to the practice of appropriating
the name to that property which the
Caesar claimed as Caesar, and the word fiscus,
without any adjunct, was used in this
sense. Ultimately the word came to signify
generally the property of the state, the Caesar
having concentrated in himself all the sovereign
power, and thus the word fiscus finally
had the same signification as aerarium in the
republican period. Various officers, as Procuratores,
Advocati, Patroni, and Praefecti,
were employed in the administration of the
fiscus.</p>


<p id="Flabellum">FLĀBELLUM, <em>dim.</em> FLĀBELLŬLUM,
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥιπίς</span>), a fan. Fans were of elegant forms,
of delicate colours, and sometimes of costly
and splendid materials, such as peacock’s
feathers; but they were stiff and of a fixed
shape, and were held by female slaves (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flabelliferae</i>),
by beautiful boys, or by eunuchs,
whose duty it was to wave them so as to
produce a cooling breeze. Besides separate
feathers the ancient fan was sometimes made
of linen, extended upon a light frame.</p>

</div>

<p id="Flagrum">FLAGRUM, <em>dim.</em> FLĂGELLUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάστιξ</span>),
a whip, a scourge, to the handle of which
was fixed a lash made of cords (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funibus</i>), or
thongs of leather (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loris</i>), especially thongs
made from the ox’s hide (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bubulis exuviis</i>).
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flagellum</i> properly so called was a dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
instrument, and is thus put in opposition
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutica</i>, which was a simple whip.
(Hor. <cite>Sat.</cite> i. 3. 119.) Cicero in like manner
contrasts the severe <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flagella</i> with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virgae</i>.
The flagellum was chiefly used in the punishment
of slaves. It was knotted with bones
or heavy indented circles of bronze or terminated
by hooks, in which case it was aptly
denominated a <em>scorpion</em>. We likewise find
that some gladiators fought with the flagella,
as in the coin here introduced.</p>


<p id="Flamen">FLĀMEN, the name for any Roman priest
who was devoted to the service of one particular
god, and who received a distinguishing
epithet from the deity to whom he ministered.
The most dignified were those attached to
Dijovis, Mars, and Quirinus, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flamen Dialis</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flamen Martialis</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flamen Quirinalis</i>.
They are said to have been established
by Numa. The number was eventually increased
to fifteen: the three original flamens
were always chosen from among the patricians,
and styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Majores</i>; the rest from the
plebeians, with the epithet <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minores</i>. Among
the minores, we read of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flamen Floralis</i>,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flamen Carmentalis</i>, &amp;c. The flamens
were elected originally at the Comitia Curiata,
but it is conjectured that subsequently to the
passing of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Domitia</i> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 104) they
were chosen in the Comitia Tributa. After
being nominated by the people, they were
received (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capti</i>) and installed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inaugurabantur</i>)
by the pontifex maximus, to whose
authority they were at all times subject.
The office was understood to last for life;
but a flamen might be compelled to resign
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flaminio abire</i>) for a breach of duty, or even
on account of the occurrence of an ill-omened
accident while discharging his functions.
Their characteristic dress was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apex</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Apex">Apex</a></span>], the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laena</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Laena">Laena</a></span>], and a laurel
wreath. The most distinguished of all the
flamens was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dialis</i>; the lowest in rank
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pomonalis</i>. The former enjoyed many
peculiar honours. When a vacancy occurred,
three persons of patrician descent, whose
parents had been married according to the
ceremonies of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">confarreatio</i>, were nominated
by the Comitia, one of whom was selected
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">captus</i>), and consecrated (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inaugurabatur</i>) by
the pontifex maximus. From that time
forward he was emancipated from the control
of his father, and became sui juris. He
alone of all priests wore the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albogalerus</i>; he
had a right to a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lictor</i>, to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</i>,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sella curulis</i>, and to a seat in the senate
in virtue of his office. If one in bonds took
refuge in his house, his chains were immediately
struck off. To counterbalance these
high honours, the dialis was subjected to a
multitude of restrictions. It was unlawful
for him to be out of the city for a single
night; and he was forbidden to sleep out of
his own bed for three nights consecutively.
He might not mount upon horseback, nor
even touch a horse, nor look upon an army
marshalled without the pomoerium, and
hence was seldom elected to the consulship.
The object of the above rules was manifestly
to make him literally <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jovi adsiduum sacerdotem</i>;
to compel constant attention to the
duties of the priesthood. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flaminica</i> was
the name given to the wife of the dialis. He
was required to wed a virgin according to
the ceremonies of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">confarreatio</i>, which regulation
also applied to the two other flamines
majores; and he could not marry a second
time. Hence, since her assistance was essential
in the performance of certain ordinances,
a divorce was not permitted, and if she died,
the dialis was obliged to resign. The municipal
towns also had their flamens. Thus
the celebrated affray between Milo and Clodius
took place while the former was on his
way to Lanuvium, of which he was then
dictator, to declare the election of a flamen
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad flaminem prodendum</i>).</p>

of May. It was said to have been instituted
at Rome in 238 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, at the command of an
oracle in the Sibylline books, for the purpose
of obtaining from the goddess the protection
of the blossoms. The celebration was, as

<p id="Foederatae">FOEDĔRĀTAE CĪVĬTĀTES, FOEDĔRĀTI,
SŎCĬI. In the seventh century of
Rome these names expressed those Italian
states which were connected with Rome by
a treaty (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foedus</i>). These names did not
include Roman colonies or Latin colonies, or
any place which had obtained the Roman
civitas or citizenship. Among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foederati</i>
were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latini</i>, who were the most nearly
related to the Romans, and were designated
by this distinctive name; the rest of the
foederati were comprised under the collective
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socii</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Foederati</i>. They
were independent states, yet under a general
liability to furnish a contingent to the Roman
army. Thus they contributed to increase
the power of Rome, but they had not the
privileges of Roman citizens. The discontent
among the foederati, and their claims to
be admitted to the privileges of Roman citizens,
led to the Social War. The Julia Lex
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 90) gave the civitas to the Socii and
Latini; and a lex of the following year contained,
among other provisions, one for the
admission to the Roman civitas of those
peregrini who were entered on the lists of
the citizens of federate states, and who complied
with the provisions of the lex. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Civitas">Civitas</a>.</span>]</p>

water, supplied by an elevated cistern, play
into an artificial basin. Such fountains
served the double purpose of use and ornament.
They were covered to keep them pure
and cool, and the covering was frequently in
the form of a monopteral temple: there were
also statues, the subjects of which were suggested
by the circumstance that every fountain
was sacred to some divinity, or they
were taken from the whole range of mythological
legends. A very large proportion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>

<p id="Fornacalia">FORNĀCĀLĬA, a festival in honour of
Fornax, the goddess of furnaces, in order
that the corn might be properly baked.
This ancient festival is said to have been
instituted by Numa. The time for its celebration
was proclaimed every year by the
curio maximus, who announced in tablets,
which were placed in the forum, the different
part which each curia had to take in the
celebration of the festival. Those persons

the means of subduing the winged horse Pegasus,
who submitted to receive it whilst he
was slaking his thirst at the fountain Peirene.
Such was the Grecian account of the
invention of the bridle, and in reference to it
Athena was worshipped at Corinth, under the

for the purpose under the title of

casual; and it was not till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 123, that the
first legal provision was made for supplying the
poor at Rome with corn at a price much below
its market value. In that year C. Sempronius
Gracchus brought forward the first <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Frumentaria</i>,
by which each citizen was entitled
to receive every month a certain quantity of
wheat (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triticum</i>) at the price of 6⅓ asses for
the modius, which was equal to 1 gallon and
nearly 8 pints English. This was only a
trifle more than half the market price. Each
person probably received five modii monthly,
as in later times. About <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 91, the tribune
M. Octavius brought forward the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Octavia</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
which modified the law of Gracchus to some
extent, so that the public treasury did not
suffer so much. Sulla went still further, and
by his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Cornelia</i>, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 82, did away altogether
with these distributions of corn; but
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 73, the Lex Sempronia was renewed
by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Terentia Cassia</i>, which enacted
that each Roman citizen should receive 5
modii a month at the price of 6⅓ asses for
each modius. The Leges Frumentariae had
<em>sold</em> corn to the people; but by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex
Clodia</i> of the tribune Clodius, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 58, the
corn was distributed without any payment;
the abolition of the payment cost the state a
fifth part of its revenues. When Caesar became
master of the Roman world, he resolved
to remedy the evils attending the
system, so far as he was able. He did not
venture to abolish altogether these distributions
of corn, but he did the next best thing
in his power, which was reducing the number
of the recipients. During the civil wars
numbers of persons, who had no claim to the
Roman franchise, had settled at Rome in
order to obtain a share in the distributions.
Caesar excluded from this privilege every
person who could not prove that he was a
Roman citizen; and thus the 320,000 persons,
who had previously received the corn,
were at once reduced to 150,000. The useful
regulations of Caesar fell into neglect
after his death; and in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 5, the number
of recipients had amounted to 320,000. But
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 2, Augustus reduced the number of
recipients to 200,000, and renewed many of
Caesar’s regulations. The chief of them
seem to have been: 1. That every citizen
should receive monthly a certain quantity of
corn (probably 5 modii) on the payment of a
certain small sum. Occasionally, in seasons of
scarcity, or in order to confer a particular
favour, Augustus made these distributions
quite gratuitous; they then became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">congiaria</i>.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Congiarium">Congiarium</a>.</span>] 2. That those who
were completely indigent should receive the
corn gratuitously, and should be furnished
for the purpose with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tesserae nummariae</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frumentariae</i>, which entitled them to the corn
without payment. The system which had
been established by Augustus, was followed
by his successors; but as it was always one
of the first maxims of the state policy of the
Roman emperors to prevent any disturbance
in the capital, they frequently lowered the
price of the public corn, and also distributed it
gratuitously as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">congiarium</i>. Hence, the cry
of the populace <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">panem et circenses</i>. In course
of time, the sale of the corn by the state
seems to have ceased altogether, and the distribution
became altogether gratuitous. Every
corn-receiver was therefore now provided
with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera</i>, and this tessera, when once
granted to him, became his property. Hence
it came to pass, that he was not only allowed
to keep the tessera for life, but even to dispose
of it by sale, and bequeath it by will.
Every citizen was competent to hold a tessera,
with the exception of senators. Further,
as the corn had been originally distributed
to the people according to the thirty-five
tribes into which they were divided, the
corn-receivers in each tribe formed a kind of
corporation, which came eventually to be
looked upon as the tribe, when the tribes had
lost all political significance. Hence, the
purchase of a tessera became equivalent to
the purchase of a place in a tribe; and, accordingly,
we find in the Digest the expressions
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emere tribum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emere tesseram</i> used
as synonymous. Another change was also introduced
at a later period, which rendered the
bounty still more acceptable to the people.
Instead of distributing the corn every month,
wheaten bread, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annona civica</i>, was
given to the people. It is uncertain at what
time this change was introduced, but it seems
to have been the custom before the reign of
Aurelian (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 270-275).</p>


<p id="Frumentarii">FRŪMENTĀRĬI, officers under the Roman
empire, who acted as spies in the provinces,
and reported to the emperors anything
which they considered of importance.
They appear to have been called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frumentarii</i>
because it was their duty to collect information
in the same way as it was the duty of other
officers, called by the same name, to collect corn.</p>


<p id="Fucus">FŪCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φῦκος</span>), the paint which the Greek
and Roman ladies employed in painting their
cheeks, eye-brows, and other parts of their
faces. The practice of painting the face was
very general among the Greek ladies, and
probably came into fashion in consequence of
their sedentary mode of life, which robbed
their complexions of their natural freshness,
and induced them to have recourse to artificial
means for restoring the red and white
of nature. The eye-brows and eye-lids were
stained black with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στίμμι</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στίμμις</span>, a sulphuret
of antimony, which is still employed
by the Turkish ladies for the same purpose.
The eye-brows were likewise stained with
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄσβολος</span>, a preparation of soot. Among the
Romans the art of painting the complexion
was carried to a still greater extent than
among the Greeks, and even Ovid did not
disdain to write a poem on the subject, which
he calls (<cite>de Art. Am.</cite> iii. 206) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">parvus, sed
cura grande, libellus, opus</span>;” though the
genuineness of the fragment of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medicamina
faciei</i>, ascribed to this poet, is doubtful.
The Roman ladies even went so far as to
paint with blue the veins on the temples.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
The ridiculous use of patches (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">splenia</i>), which
were common among the English ladies in
the reign of Queen Anne and the first
Georges, was not unknown to the Roman
ladies. The more effeminate of the male sex
at Rome, and likewise in Greece, also employed
paint.</p>

<p id="Fullo">FULLO (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κναφεύς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γναφεύς</span>), also called
NACCA, a fuller, a washer or scourer of
cloth and linen. The fullones not only received
the cloth as it came from the loom in
order to scour and smooth it, but also washed
and cleansed garments which had been already
worn. The clothes were first washed,
which was done in tubs or vats, where they
were trodden upon and stamped by the feet of
the fullones, whence Seneca speaks of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saltus
fullonicus</i>. The ancients were not acquainted
with soap, but they used in its stead different
kinds of alkali, by which the dirt was more
easily separated from the clothes. Of these, by
far the most common was the urine of men and
animals, which was mixed with the water in
which the clothes were washed. When the
clothes were dry, the wool was brushed and
carded to raise the nap, sometimes with the
skin of a hedgehog, and sometimes with some
plants of the thistle kind. The clothes were
then hung on a vessel of basket-work (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viminea
cavea</i>), under which sulphur was placed
in order to whiten the cloth. A fine white
earth, called Cimolian by Pliny, was often
rubbed into the cloth to increase its whiteness.
The establishment or workshop of the
fullers was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fullonica</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fullonicum</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fullonimn</i>. The Greeks were also accustomed
to send their garments to fullers to be
washed and scoured. The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλύνειν</span>
denoted the washing of linen, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κναφεύειν</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γναφεύειν</span> the washing of woollen clothes.</p>


<p id="Funambulus">FŪNAMBŬLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλοβάτης σχοινοβάτης</span>),
a rope-dancer. The art of dancing on the
tight-rope was carried to as great perfection
among the Romans as it is with us. The
performers placed themselves in an endless
variety of graceful and sportive attitudes,
and represented the characters of bacchanals,
satyrs, and other imaginary beings. One of
the most difficult exploits was running down
the rope at the conclusion of the performance.
It was a strange attempt of Germanicus and
of the emperor Galba to exhibit elephants
walking on the rope.</p>


<p id="Funda">FUNDA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφενδόνη</span>), a sling. Slingers are
not mentioned in the Iliad; but the light
troops of the Greek and Roman armies consisted
in great part of slingers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funditores</i>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφενδονήται</span>). The most celebrated slingers
were the inhabitants of the Balearic islands.
Besides stones, plummets, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">glandes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μολυβδίδες</span>),
of a form between acorns and almonds,
were cast in moulds to be thrown with slings.
The manner in which the sling was wielded
may be seen in the annexed figure of a soldier
with a provision of stones in the sinus
of his pallium, and with his arm extended in
order to whirl the sling about his head.</p>

<p id="Funus">FŪNUS, a funeral.&mdash;(1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span> The
Greeks attached great importance to the burial
of the dead. They believed that souls
could not enter the Elysian fields till their
bodies had been buried; and so strong was this
feeling among the Greeks, that it was considered
a religious duty to throw earth upon a
dead body, which a person might happen to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
find unburied; and among the Athenians,
those children who were released from all
other obligations to unworthy parents, were
nevertheless bound to bury them by one of
Solon’s laws. The neglect of burying one’s
relatives is frequently mentioned by the
orators as a grave charge against the moral
character of a man; in fact, the burial of the
body by the relations of the dead was considered
one of the most sacred duties by the
universal law of the Greeks. Sophocles represents
Antigone as disregarding all consequences
in order to bury the dead body of
her brother Polyneices, which Creon, the
king of Thebes, had commanded to be left
unburied. The common expressions for the
funeral rites, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὰ δίκαια</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμιμα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νομιζόμενα</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσήκοντα</span>, show that the dead had, as it
were, a legal and moral claim to burial. After
a person was dead, it was the custom first to
place in his mouth an obolus, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">danace</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δανάκη</span>), with which he might pay the ferryman
in Hades. The body was then washed
and anointed with perfumed oil, the head
was crowned with the flowers which happened
to be in season, and the body dressed
in as handsome a robe as the family could
afford. These duties were not performed by
hired persons, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pollinctores</i> among the
Romans, but by the women of the family,
upon whom the care of the corpse always devolved.
The corpse was then laid out (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόθεσις</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προτίθεσθαι</span>) on a bed, which appears to
have been of the ordinary kind, with a pillow
for supporting the head and back. By
the side of the bed there were placed
painted earthen vessels, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λήκυθοι</span>, which
were also buried with the corpse. Great
numbers of these painted vases have been
found in modern times; and they have been
of great use in explaining many matters connected
with antiquity. A honey-cake, called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελιττοῦτα</span>, which appears to have been intended
for Cerberus, was also placed by the
side of the corpse. Before the door a vessel
of water was placed, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄστρακον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρδάλιον</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρδάνιον</span>, in order that persons who had
been in the house might purify themselves by
sprinkling water on their persons. The relatives
stood around the bed, the women
uttering great lamentations, rending their
garments, and tearing their hair. On the
day after the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόθεσις</span>, or the third day after
death, the corpse was carried out (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκφορά</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκκομιδή</span>) for burial, early in the morning and
before sunrise. A burial soon after death
was supposed to be pleasing to the dead. In
some places it appears to have been usual to
bury the dead on the day following death.
The men walked before the corpse, and the
women behind. The funeral procession was
preceded or followed by hired mourners
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρηνῳδοί</span>), who appear to have been usually
Carian women, playing mournful tunes on
the flute. The body was either buried or
burnt. The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάπτειν</span> is used in connection
with either mode; it is applied to the
collection of the ashes after burning, and
accordingly we find the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καίειν</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάπτειν</span> used together. The proper expression
for interment in the earth is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατορύττειν</span>.
In Homer the bodies of the dead are
burnt; but interment was also used in very
ancient times. Cicero says that the dead were
buried at Athens in the time of Cecrops; and
we also read of the bones of Orestes being
found in a coffin at Tegea. The dead were
commonly buried among the Spartans and
the Sicyonians, and the prevalence of this
practice is proved by the great number of
skeletons found in coffins in modern times,
which have evidently not been exposed to
the action of fire. Both burning and burying
appear to have been always used to a
greater or less extent at different periods;
till the spread of Christianity at length put
an end to the former practice. The dead
bodies were usually burnt on piles of wood,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pyres</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυραί</span>). The body was placed
on the top; and in the heroic times it was
customary to burn with the corpse animals
and even captives or slaves. Oils and perfumes
were also thrown into the flames.
When the pyre was burnt down, the remains
of the fire were quenched with wine, and the
relatives and friends collected the bones.
The bones were then washed with wine and
oil, and placed in urns, which were sometimes
made of gold. The corpses which were
not burnt were buried in coffins, which were
called by various names, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σοροί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύελοι</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ληνοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λάρνακες</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δροῖται</span>, though some of these
names are also applied to the urns in which
the bones were collected. They were made
of various materials, but were usually of
baked clay or earthenware. The following
woodcut contains two of the most ancient
kind; the figure in the middle is the section
of one. The dead were usually buried outside
the town, as it was thought that their
presence in the city brought pollution to the
living. At Athens none were allowed to be
buried within the city; but Lycurgus, in
order to remove all superstition respecting
the presence of the dead, allowed of burial in
Sparta. Persons who possessed lands in Attica
were frequently buried in them, and we
therefore read of tombs in the fields. Tombs,
however, were most frequently built by the
side of roads, and near the gates of the city.
At Athens, the most common place of burial
was outside of the Itonian gate, near the
road leading to the Peiraeeus, which gate
was for that reason called the burial gate.
Those who had fallen in battle were buried
at the public expense in the outer Cerameicus,
on the road leading to the Academia.
Tombs were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θῆκαι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάφοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μνήματα</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μνημεῖα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σήματα</span>. Many of these were only
mounds of earth or stones (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χώματα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κολῶναι</span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύμβοι</span>). Others were built of stone, and
frequently ornamented with great taste.
Some Greek tombs were built under ground,
and called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hypogea</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπόγαια</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπόγεια</span>).
They correspond to the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditoria</i>.
The monuments erected over the graves of
persons were usually of four kinds: 1.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στῆλαι</span>, pillars or upright stone tablets; 2.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κίονες</span>, columns; 3. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναΐδια</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡρῷα</span>, small
buildings in the form of temples; and 4. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τράπεζαι</span>,
flat square stones, called by Cicero
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensae</i>. The term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στῆλαι</span> is sometimes applied
to all kinds of funeral monuments, but
properly designates upright stone tablets, which
were usually terminated with an oval heading,
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίθημα</span>. The epithema was frequently
ornamented with a kind of arabesque
work, as in the preceding specimen. The
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κίονες</span>, or columns, were of various forms, as is
shown by the two specimens in the annexed cut.</p>

<p>The inscriptions upon these funeral monuments
usually contain the name of the deceased
person, and that of the demus to which he
belonged, as well as frequently some account
of his life. The following example of an
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡρῷον</span> will give a general idea of monuments
of this kind.&mdash;Orations in praise of the dead
were sometimes pronounced; but Solon ordained
that such orations should be confined
to persons who were honoured with a public
funeral. In the heroic ages games were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]<br /><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
celebrated at the funeral of a great man, as
in the case of Patroclus; but this practice
does not seem to have been usual in the historical
times.&mdash;All persons who had been engaged
in funerals were considered polluted,
and could not enter the temples of the gods
till they had been purified. After the funeral
was over, the relatives partook of a
feast, which was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίδειπνον</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεκρόδειπνον</span>.
This feast was always given at the
house of the nearest relative of the deceased.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="ill187" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill187.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Sepulchral Heroon. (Painting on Vase.)</div>
</div>

<p>Thus the relatives of those who had fallen
at the battle of Chaeroneia partook of the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίδειπνον</span> at the house of Demosthenes, as
if he were the nearest relative to them all.
On the second day after the funeral a sacrifice
to the dead was offered, called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίτα</span>; but the principal sacrifice to the dead
was on the ninth day, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔννατα</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔνατα</span>. The mourning for the dead appears
to have lasted till the thirtieth day after the
funeral, on which day sacrifices were again
offered. At Sparta the time of mourning was
limited to eleven days. During the time of
mourning it was considered indecorous for
the relatives of the deceased to appear in
public; they were accustomed to wear a
black dress, and in ancient times they cut off
their hair as a sign of grief.&mdash;The tombs were
preserved by the family to which they belonged
with the greatest care, and were
regarded as among the strongest ties which
attached a man to his native land. In the
Docimasia of the Athenian archons it was
always a subject of inquiry whether they had
kept in proper repair the tombs of their
ancestors. On certain days the tombs were
crowned with flowers, and offerings were
made to the dead, consisting of garlands of
flowers and various other things. The act
of offering these presents was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐναγίζειν</span>,
and the offerings themselves <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐναγίσματα</span>, or
more commonly <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χοαί</span>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γενέσια</span> mentioned
by Herodotus appear to have consisted in
offerings of the same kind, which were presented
on the anniversary of the birth-day of
the deceased. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεκύσια</span> were probably
offerings on the anniversary of the day of
the death; though, according to some writers,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεκύσια</span> were the same as the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γενέσια</span>.
Certain criminals, who were put to death by
the state, were also deprived of the rights of
burial, which was considered as an additional
punishment. There were certain places, both
at Athens and Sparta, where the dead bodies
of such criminals were cast. A person who had
committed suicide was not deprived of burial,
but the hand with which he had killed himself
was cut off and buried by itself.&mdash;(2) <span id="Funus_r" class="smcap">Roman.</span>
When a Roman was at the point of death, his
nearest relation present endeavoured to catch
the last breath with his mouth. The ring was
taken off the finger of the dying person; and
as soon as he was dead his eyes and mouth
were closed by the nearest relation, who called
upon the deceased by name, exclaiming <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">have</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vale</i>. The corpse was then washed, and
anointed with oil and perfumes, by slaves,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pollinctores</i>, who belonged to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libitinarii</i>,
or undertakers. The libitinarii
appear to have been so called because they
dwelt near the temple of Venus Libitina,
where all things requisite for funerals were
sold. Hence we find the expressions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitare
Libitinam</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">evadere Libitinam</i> used in the
sense of escaping death. At this temple an
account (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ratio, ephemeris</i>) was kept of those
who died, and a small sum was paid for the
registration of their names. A small coin
was then placed in the mouth of the corpse,
in order to pay the ferryman in Hades, and
the body was laid out on a couch in the
vestibule of the house, with its feet towards
the door, and dressed in the best robe which
the deceased had worn when alive. Ordinary
citizens were dressed in a white toga, and
magistrates in their official robes. If the
deceased had received a crown while alive as
a reward for his bravery, it was now placed
on his head; and the couch on which he was
laid was sometimes covered with leaves and
flowers. A branch of cypress was also usually
placed at the door of the house, if he was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
person of consequence. Funerals were usually
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funera justa</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exsequiae</i>; the latter
term was generally applied to the funeral
procession (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pompa funebris</i>). There were
two kinds of funerals, public and private;
of which the former was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funus publicum</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">indictivum</i>, because the people were invited
to it by a herald; the latter <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funus tacitum</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">translatitium</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plebeium</i>. A person
appears to have usually left a certain sum of
money in his will to pay the expenses of his
funeral; but if he did not do so, nor appoint
any one to bury him, this duty devolved upon
the persons to whom the property was left,
and if he died without a will, upon his relations,
according to their order of succession
to the property. The expenses of the funeral
were in such cases decided by an arbiter,
according to the property and rank of the
deceased, whence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbitria</i> is used to signify
the funeral expenses.&mdash;The following description
of the mode in which a funeral was conducted
only applies strictly to the funerals of
the great; the same pomp and ceremony
could not of course be observed in the case of
persons in ordinary circumstances. All
funerals in ancient times were performed at
night, but afterwards the poor only were
buried at night, because they could not afford
to have any funeral procession. The corpse
was usually carried out of the house (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">efferebatur</i>)
on the eighth day after the death.
The order of the funeral procession was regulated
by a person called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">designator</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominus
funeris</i>, who was attended by lictors dressed
in black. It was headed by musicians of
various kinds (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornicines, siticines</i>), who
played mournful strains, and next came
mourning women, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praeficae</i>, who were
hired to lament and sing the funeral song
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">naenia</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lessus</i>) in praise of the deceased.
These were sometimes followed by players
and buffoons (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scurrae, histriones</i>), of whom
one, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">archimimus</i>, represented the character
of the deceased, and imitated his words
and actions. Then came the slaves whom
the deceased had liberated, wearing the cap
of liberty (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pileati</i>); the number of whom was
occasionally very great, since a master sometimes
liberated all his slaves, in his will, in
order to add to the pomp of his funeral. Before
the corpse the images of the deceased
and of his ancestors were carried, and also
the crowns or military rewards which he had
gained. The corpse was carried on a couch
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lectica</i>), to which the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feretrum</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capulum</i> was usually given; but the bodies
of poor citizens and of slaves were carried on
a common kind of bier or coffin, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sandapila</i>.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sandapila</i> was carried by bearers,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vespae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vespillones</i>, because they
carried out the corpses in the evening (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vespertino
tempore</i>). The couches on which the
corpses of the rich were carried were sometimes
made of ivory, and covered with gold
and purple. They were often carried on the
shoulders of the nearest relations of the
deceased, and sometimes on those of his
freedmen. Julius Caesar was carried by the
magistrates, and Augustus by the senators.
The relations of the deceased walked behind
the corpse in mourning; his sons with their
heads veiled, and his daughters with their
heads bare and their hair dishevelled, contrary
to the ordinary practice of both. They
often uttered loud lamentations, and the women
beat their breasts and tore their cheeks,
though this was forbidden by the Twelve
Tables. If the deceased was of illustrious
rank, the funeral procession went through
the forum, and stopped before the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostra</i>,
where a funeral oration (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laudatio</i>) in praise
of the deceased was delivered. This practice
was of great antiquity among the Romans,
and is said by some writers to have been first
introduced by Publicola, who pronounced a
funeral oration in honour of his colleague
Brutus. Women also were honoured by
funeral orations. From the Forum the corpse
was carried to the place of burning or burial,
which, according to a law of the Twelve
Tables, was obliged to be outside the city.
The Romans in the most ancient times buried
their dead, though they also early adopted,
to some extent, the custom of burning, which
is mentioned in the Twelve Tables. Burning,
however, does not appear to have become
general till the later times of the republic.
Marius was buried, and Sulla was the first of
the Cornelian gens whose body was burned.
Under the empire burning was almost universally
practised, but was gradually discontinued
as Christianity spread, so that it had
fallen into disuse in the fourth century. Persons
struck by lightning were not burnt, but
buried on the spot, which was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bidental</i>,
and was considered sacred. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Bidental">Bidental</a>.</span>]
Children also, who had not cut their teeth,
were not burnt, but buried in a place called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Suggrundarium</i>. Those who were buried were
placed in a coffin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arca</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">loculus</i>), which
was frequently made of stone, and sometimes
of the Assian stone, which came from Assos
in Troas, and which consumed all the body,
with the exception of the teeth, in 40 days,
whence it was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sarcophagus</i>. This name
was in course of time applied to any kind of
coffin or tomb. The corpse was burnt on a
pile of wood (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pyra</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogus</i>). This pile was
built in the form of an altar, with four equal
sides, whence we find it called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ara sepulcri</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funeris ara</i>. The sides of the pile were,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
according to the Twelve Tables, to be left
rough and unpolished, but were frequently
covered with dark leaves. Cypress trees
were sometimes placed before the pile. On
the top of the pile the corpse was placed,
with the couch on which it had been carried,
and the nearest relation then set fire to the
pile with his face turned away. When the
flames began to rise, various perfumes were
thrown into the fire, though this practice
was forbidden by the Twelve Tables; cups
of oil, ornaments, clothes, dishes of food, and
other things, which were supposed to be
agreeable to the deceased, were also thrown
upon the flames. The place where a person
was burnt was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bustum</i>, if he was afterwards
buried on the same spot, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ustrina</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ustrinum</i> if he was buried at a different
place. Sometimes animals were slaughtered
at the pile, and in ancient times captives and
slaves, since the manes were supposed to be
fond of blood; but afterwards gladiators,
called bustuarii, were hired to fight round
the burning pile. When the pile was burnt
down, the embers were soaked with wine,
and the bones and ashes of the deceased
were gathered by the nearest relatives,
who sprinkled them with perfumes, and
placed them in a vessel called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urna</i>, which
was made of various materials, according
to the circumstances of individuals.</p>

  <div class="caption">Sepulchral Urn in British Museum</div>
</div>

<p>The urnae were also of various shapes,
but most commonly square or round;
and upon them there was usually an
inscription or epitaph (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">titulus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epitaphium</i>),
beginning with the letters
D. M. S., or only D. M., that is, <span class="smcap">Dis
Manibus Sacrum</span>, followed by the name
of the deceased, with the length of his
life, &amp;c. The woodcut opposite is a
representation of a sepulchral urn in
the British Museum. It is of an upright
rectangular form, richly ornamented
with foliage, and supported at
the sides with pilasters. It is to the
memory of Cossutia Prima. Its height
is 21 inches, and its width at the base
14 inches 6-8ths. Below the inscription
an infant genius is represented
driving a car drawn by four horses.&mdash;After
the bones and ashes of the deceased
had been placed in the urn, the
persons present were thrice sprinkled
by a priest with pure water from a
branch of olive or laurel for the purpose
of purification; after which they
were dismissed by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefica</i>, or some
other person, by the solemn word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ilicet</i>,
that is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ire licet</i>. At their departure they
were accustomed to bid farewell to the
deceased by pronouncing the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vale</i>.
The urns were placed in sepulchres, which,
as already stated, were outside the city,
though in a few cases we read of the dead
being buried within the city. Thus Valerius
Publicola, Tubertus, and Fabricius, were
buried in the city; which right their descendants
also possessed, but did not use.
The vestal virgins and the emperors were
buried in the city.&mdash;The verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepelire</i>, like
the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θάπτειν</span>, was applied to every mode
of disposing of the dead; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepulcrum</i> signified
any kind of tomb in which the body or
bones of a man were placed. The term
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">humare</i> was originally used for burial in the
earth, but was afterwards applied like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepelire</i>
to any mode of disposing of the dead:
since it appears to have been the custom,
after the body was burnt, to throw some
earth upon the bones.&mdash;The places for burial
were either public or private. The public
places of burial were of two kinds; one for
illustrious citizens, who were buried at the
public expense, and the other for poor citizens,
who could not afford to purchase ground for
the purpose. The former was in the Campus
Martius, which was ornamented with the
tombs of the illustrious dead, and in the
Campus Esquilinus; the latter was also in
the Campus Esquilinus, and consisted of small
pits or caverns, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puticuli</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puticulae</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
but as this place rendered the neighbourhood
unhealthy, it was given to Maecenas, who
converted it into gardens, and built a magnificent
house upon it. Private places for
burial were usually by the sides of the roads
leading to Rome; and on some of these
roads, such as the Via Appia, the tombs
formed an almost uninterrupted street for
many miles from the gates of the city. They
were frequently built by individuals during
their lifetime; thus Augustus, in his sixth
consulship, built the Mausoleum for his sepulchre
between the Via Flaminia and the
Tiber, and planted round it woods and walks
for public use. The heirs were often ordered
by the will of the deceased to build a tomb
for him; and they sometimes did it at their
own expense.&mdash;Sepulchres were originally
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">busta</i>, but this word was afterwards
employed in the manner mentioned under
Bustum. Sepulchres were also frequently
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monumenta</i>, but this term was also
applied to a monument erected to the memory
of a person in a different place from that where
he was buried. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conditoria</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditiva</i> were
sepulchres under ground, in which dead
bodies were placed entire, in contradistinction
to those sepulchres which contained the
bones and ashes only.&mdash;The tombs of the rich
were commonly built of marble, and the
ground enclosed with an iron railing or wall,
and planted round with trees. The extent
of the burying-ground was marked by cippi
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cippus">Cippus</a></span>]. The name of mausoleum, which
was originally the name of the magnificent
sepulchre erected by Artemisia to the memory
of Mausolus, king of Caria, was sometimes
given to any splendid tomb. The open
space before a sepulchre was called forum,
and neither this space nor the sepulchre
itself could become the property of a
person by usucapion. Private tombs were
either built by an individual for himself and
the members of his family (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepulcra familiaria</i>),
or for himself and his heirs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepulcra
hereditaria</i>). A tomb, which was fitted up
with niches to receive the funeral urns, was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">columbarium</i>, on account of the resemblance
of these niches to the holes of a
pigeon-house. In these tombs the ashes of
the freedmen and slaves of great families
were frequently placed in vessels made of
baked clay, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ollae</i>, which were let into
the thickness of the wall within these niches,
the lids only being seen, and the inscriptions
placed in front. Tombs were of various sizes
and forms, according to the wealth and taste
of the owner. A sepulchre, or any place in
which a person was buried, was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">religiosus</i>;
all things which were left or belonged to the
Dii Manes were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">religiosae</i>; those consecrated
to the Dii Superi were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacrae</i>. Even
the place in which a slave was buried was
considered religiosus. Whoever violated a
sepulchre was subject to an action termed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sepulcri violati actio</i>. After the bones had
been placed in the urn at the funeral, the
friends returned home. They then underwent
a further purification, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suffitio</i>, which
consisted in being sprinkled with water and
stepping over a fire. The house itself was
also swept with a certain kind of broom;
which sweeping or purification was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exverrae</i>, and the person who did it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">everriator</i>.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Denicales Feriae</i> were also days set apart
for the purification of the family. The mourning
and solemnities connected with the dead
lasted for nine days after the funeral, at the
end of which time a sacrifice was performed,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novendiale</i>.&mdash;A feast was given in
honour of the dead, but it is uncertain on
what day; it sometimes appears to have been
given at the time of the funeral, sometimes
on the novendiale, and sometimes later. The
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silicernium</i> was given to this feast.
Among the tombs at Pompeii there is a funeral
triclinium for the celebration of these
feasts, which is represented in the annexed
woodcut. It is open to the sky, and the walls
are ornamented by paintings of animals in the
centre of compartments, which have borders of
flowers. The triclinium is made of stone, with
a pedestal in the centre to receive the table.
After the funeral of great men, there was, in
addition to the feast for the friends of the
deceased, a distribution of raw meat to the
people, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">visceratio</i>, and sometimes a
public banquet. Combats of gladiators and
other games were also frequently exhibited
in honour of the deceased. Thus at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
funeral of P. Licinius Crassus, who had been
Pontifex Maximus, raw meat was distributed
to the people, 120 gladiators fought, and
funeral games were celebrated for three
days, at the end of which a public banquet
was given in the forum. Public feasts
and funeral games were sometimes given on
the anniversary of funerals. At all banquets
in honour of the dead, the guests were
dressed in white.&mdash;The Romans, like the
Greeks, were accustomed to visit the tombs
of their relatives at certain periods, and to
offer to them sacrifices and various gifts,
which were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inferiae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parentalia</i>.
The Romans appear to have regarded the
manes or departed souls of their ancestors as
gods; whence arose the practice of presenting
to them oblations, which consisted of
victims, wine, milk, garlands of flowers, and
other things. The tombs were sometimes
illuminated on these occasions with lamps.
In the latter end of the month of February
there was a festival, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feralia</i>, in which
the Romans were accustomed to carry food
to the sepulchres for the use of the dead.
The Romans were accustomed to wear mourning
for their deceased friends, which appears
to have been black under the republic for
both sexes. Under the empire the men continued
to wear black in mourning, but the
women wore white. They laid aside all kinds
of ornaments, and did not cut either their
hair or beard. Men appear to have usually
worn their mourning for only a few days,
but women for a year when they lost a husband
or parent. In a public mourning on
account of some signal calamity, as, for instance,
the loss of a battle, or the death of an
emperor, there was a total cessation from
business, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">justitium</i>, which was usually
ordained by public appointment. During
this period the courts of justice did not sit,
the shops were shut, and the soldiers freed
from military duties. In a public mourning
the senators did not wear the latus clavus
and their rings, nor the magistrates their
badges of office.</p>

<p id="Furca">FURCA, which properly means a fork,
was also the name of an instrument of punishment.
It was a piece of wood in the
form of the letter Λ, which was placed upon
the shoulders of the offender, whose hands
were tied to it. Slaves were frequently
punished in this way, and were obliged to
carry about the furca wherever they went;
whence the appellation of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">furcifer</i> was applied
to a man as a term of reproach. The
furca was used in the ancient mode of
capital punishment among the Romans; the
criminal was tied to it, and then scourged to
death. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patibulum</i> was also an instrument
of punishment, resembling the furca;
it appears to have been in the form of the
letter Π. Both the furca and patibulum
were also employed as crosses, to which criminals
appear to have been nailed.</p>

<p id="Fuscina">FUSCĬNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίαινα</span>), a trident, more commonly
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tridens</i>, meaning <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tridens stimulus</i>,
because it was originally a three-pronged
goad, used to incite horses to greater swiftness.
Neptune was supposed to be armed
with it when he drove his chariot, and it
thus became his usual attribute, perhaps
with an allusion also to the use of the same
instrument in harpooning fish. It is represented
in the cut on <a href="#ill084b">p. 84</a>. In the contests of
gladiators, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">retiarius</i> was armed with a
trident. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Gladiatores">Gladiatores</a></span>]</p>


<p id="Fustuarium">FUSTŬĀRĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξυλοκοπία</span>), was a capital
punishment inflicted upon Roman soldiers
for desertion, theft, and similar crimes. It
was administered in the following manner:&mdash;When
a soldier was condemned, the tribune
touched him slightly with a stick, upon
which all the soldiers of the legion fell upon
him with sticks and stones, and generally
killed him upon the spot. If, however, he
escaped, for he was allowed to fly, he could
not return to his native country, nor did any
of his relatives dare to receive him into their
houses.</p>


<p id="Fusus">FŪSUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτρακτος</span>), the spindle, was always,
when in use, accompanied by the distaff
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colus</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠλακάτη</span>), as an indispensable part of
the same apparatus. The wool, flax, or other
material, having been prepared for spinning,
was rolled into a ball (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τολύπη</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">glomus</i>),
which was, however, sufficiently loose to
allow the fibres to be easily drawn out by
the hand of the spinner. The upper part of
the distaff was then inserted into this mass
of flax or wool, and the lower part was held
under the left arm in such a position as was
most convenient for conducting the operation.
The fibres were drawn out, and at the
same time spirally twisted, chiefly by the use
of the fore-finger and thumb of the right
hand; and the thread (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filum, stamen</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νήμα</span>)
so produced was wound upon the spindle
until the quantity was as great as it would
carry. The spindle was a stick, 10 or 12
inches long, having at the top a slit or catch
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dens</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγκιστρον</span>) in which the thread was
fixed, so that the weight of the spindle
might continually carry down the thread as
it was formed. Its lower extremity was
inserted into a small wheel, called the whorl
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vorticellum</i>), made of wood, stone, or metal
(see woodcut), the use of which was to keep
the spindle more steady, and to promote its
rotation. The accompanying woodcut shows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
the operation of spinning, at the moment
when the woman has drawn out a sufficient
length of yarn to twist it by whirling the
spindle with her right thumb and fore-finger,
and previously to the act of taking it out of
the slit to wind it upon the bobbin (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πήνιον</span>)
already formed. It was usual to have a
basket to hold the distaff and spindle, with
the balls of wool prepared for spinning, and
the bobbins already spun. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Calathus">Calathus</a>.</span>] The
distaff and spindle, with the wool and thread
upon them, were carried in bridal processions;
and, without the wool and thread,
they were often suspended by females as
offerings of religious gratitude, especially in
old age, or on relinquishing the constant use
of them. They were most frequently dedicated
to Pallas, the patroness of spinning,
and of the arts connected with it. They
were exhibited in the representations of the
three Fates, who were conceived, by their
spinning, to determine the life of every
man.</p>

<p id="Galea">GĂLĔA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κράνος</span>, <em>poet</em>. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόρυς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πήληξ</span>), a
helmet; a casque. The helmet was originally
made of skin or leather, whence is supposed
to have arisen its appellation, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυνέη</span>,
meaning properly a helmet of dog-skin, but
applied to caps or helmets made of the hide
of other animals, and even to those which
were entirely of bronze or iron. The leathern
basis of the helmet was also very commonly
strengthened and adorned by the addition of
either bronze or gold. Helmets which had a
metallic basis were in Latin properly called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cassides</i>, although the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">galea</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cassis</i>
are often confounded. The additions by
which the external appearance of the helmet
was varied, and which served both for ornament
and protection, were the following:&mdash;1.
Bosses or plates (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλος</span>), proceeding either
from the top or the sides, and varying in
number from one to four (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίφαλος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετράφαλος</span>).
The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάλος</span> was often an emblematical
figure, referring to the character of the
wearer. Thus in the colossal statue of Athena
in the Parthenon at Athens, she bore
a sphinx on the top of her helmet, and a
griffin on each side. 2. The helmet thus
adorned was very commonly surmounted by
the crest (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crista</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόφος</span>), which was often of
horse-hair. 3. The two cheek-pieces (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bucculae</i>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραγναθίδες</span>), which were attached to
the helmet by hinges, so as to be lifted up
and down. They had buttons or ties at
their extremities, for fastening the helmet
on the head. 4. The beaver, or visor, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
peculiar form of which is supposed to have
been the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλῶπις τρυφάλεια</span>, <em>i.e.</em> the perforated
beaver. The gladiators wore helmets
of this kind.</p>

<p id="Galerus">GĂLĒRUS or GALĒRUM, originally a
covering for the head worn by priests, especially
by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flamen dialis</i>. It appears to
have been a round cap made of leather, with
its top ending in an apex or point. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Apex">Apex</a>.</span>]
In course of time the name was applied to
any kind of cap fitting close to the head like
a helmet. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galerus</i> and its diminutive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galericulum</i>
are also used to signify a covering
for the head made of hair, and hence a wig.</p>


<p id="Galli">GALLI, the priests of Cybelé, whose worship
was introduced at Rome from Phrygia.
The Galli were, according to an ancient custom,
always castrated, and it would seem
that, impelled by religious fanaticism, they
performed this operation on themselves. In
their wild, enthusiastic, and boisterous rites
they resembled the Corybantes. They seem
to have been always chosen from a poor and
despised class of people, for, while no other
priests were allowed to beg, the Galli were
permitted to do so on certain days. The chief
priest among them was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">archigallus</i>.</p>


<p id="Gamelia">GĂMĒLĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γαμηλία</span>). The demes and
phratries of Attica possessed various means
to prevent intruders from assuming the
rights of citizens. Among other regulations,
it was ordained that every bride, previous to
her marriage, should be introduced by her
parents or guardians to the phratria of her
husband. This introduction of the young
women was accompanied by presents to their
new phratores, which were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gamelia</i>.
The women were enrolled in the lists of the
phratries, and this enrolment was also called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gamelia</i>.</p>


<p id="Gausapa">GAUSĂPA, GAUSĂPE, or GAUSĂPUM,
a kind of thick cloth, which was on one side
very woolly, and was used to cover tables and
beds, and by persons to wrap themselves up
after taking a bath, or in general to protect
themselves against rain and cold. It was
worn by men as well as women. The word
gausapa is also sometimes used to designate
a thick wig, such as was made of the hair of
Germans, and worn by the fashionable people
at Rome at the time of the emperors.</p>


<p id="Genesia">GĔNĔSIA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Genos">GĔNOS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένος</span>). [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribus">Tribus</a>, Greek.</span>]</p>


<p id="Gens">GENS. According to the traditional accounts
of the old Roman constitution, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gentes</i> were subdivisions of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiae</i>, just
as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiae</i> were subdivisions of the three
ancient tribes, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ramnes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Titienses</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Luceres</i>. There were ten gentes in each
curia, and consequently one hundred gentes
in each tribe, and three hundred in the three
tribes. Now if there is any truth in the
tradition of this original distribution of the
population into tribes, curiae, and gentes, it
follows that there was no necessary kinship
among those families which belonged to a
gens, any more than among those families
which belonged to one curia. The name of
the gens was always characterised by the
termination <em>ia</em>, as Julia, Cornelia, Valeria;
and the gentiles, or members of a gens, all
bore the name of the gens to which they
belonged. As the gentes were subdivisions
of the three ancient tribes, the populus (in
the ancient sense) alone had gentes, so that to
be a patrician and to have a gens were
synonymous; and thus we find the expressions
gens and patricii constantly united.
Yet it appears that some gentes contained
plebeian familiae, which it is conjectured had
their origin in marriages between patricians
and plebeians before there was connubium
between them. A hundred new members
were added to the senate by the first Tarquin.
These were the representatives of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Luceres</i>,
the third and inferior tribe; which is indicated
by the gentes of this tribe being called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minores</i>, by way of being distinguished from
the older gentes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">majores</i>, of the Ramnes and
Tities, a distinction which appears to have
been more than nominal. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Senatus">Senatus</a>.</span>] There
were certain sacred rites (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacra gentilitia</i>)
which belonged to a gens, to which all the
members of a gens, as such, were bound. It
was the duty of the pontifices to look after
the due observance of these gentile sacra, and
to see that they were not lost. Each gens
seems to have had its peculiar place (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacellum</i>)
for the celebration of these sacra, which
were performed at stated times. By the law
of the Twelve Tables the property of a person
who died intestate devolved upon the gens to
which he belonged.</p>


<p id="Geomori">GĔŌMŎRI. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribus">Tribus</a>, Greek.</span>]</p>


<p id="Gerousia">GĔROUSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γερούσια</span>), or <em>assembly of
elders</em>, was the aristocratic element of the
Spartan polity. It was not peculiar to Sparta
only, but found in other Dorian states, just
as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Boulé</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βουλή</span>) or democratical council
was an element of most Ionian constitutions.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gerousia</i> at Sparta, including the two
kings, its presidents, consisted of thirty
members (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γέροντες</span>): a number which seems
connected with the divisions of the Spartan
people. Every Dorian state, in fact, was
divided into three tribes: the Hylleis, the
Dymanes, and the Pamphyli. The tribes at
Sparta were again subdivided into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὠβαί</span>),
which were, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gerontes</i>, thirty in
number, so that each oba was represented by
its councillor: any inference which leads to
the conclusion that two obae at least of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Hyllean tribe, must have belonged to the
royal house of the Heracleids. No one was
eligible to the council till he was sixty years
of age, and the additional qualifications were
strictly of an aristocratic nature. We are
told, for instance, that the office of a councillor
was the reward and prize of virtue, and
that it was confined to men of distinguished
character and station. The election was determined
by vote, and the mode of conducting
it was remarkable for its old-fashioned simplicity.
The competitors presented themselves
one after another to the assembly of
electors; the latter testified their esteem by
acclamations, which varied in intensity according
to the popularity of the candidates
for whom they were given. These manifestations
of esteem were noted by persons in
an adjoining building, who could judge of
the shouting, but could not tell in whose
favour it was given. The person whom
these judges thought to have been most applauded
was declared the successful candidate.
The office lasted for life. The functions
of the councillors were partly deliberative,
partly judicial, and partly executive. In the
discharge of the first, they prepared measures
and passed preliminary decrees, which were
to be laid before the popular assembly, so
that the important privilege of initiating all
changes in the government or laws was vested
in them. As a criminal court, they could
punish with death and civil degradation
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</span>). They also appear to have exercised,
like the Areiopagus at Athens, a general superintendence
and inspection over the lives
and manners of the citizens, and probably
were allowed a kind of patriarchal authority,
to enforce the observance of ancient usage
and discipline. It is not, however, easy to
define with exactness the original extent of
their functions, especially as respects the last-mentioned
duty, since the ephors not only
encroached upon the prerogatives of the king
and council, but also possessed, in very early
times, a censorial power, and were not likely
to permit any diminution of its extent.</p>


<p id="Gerrha">GERRHA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γέῤῥα</span>), in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gerrae</i>, properly
signified any thing made of wicker-work,
and was especially used as the name of
the Persian shields, which were made of
wicker-work, and were smaller and shorter
than the Greek shields.</p>


<p id="Gladiatores">GLĂDĬĀTŌRES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μονομάχοι</span>) were men who
fought with swords in the amphitheatre and
other places, for the amusement of the Roman
people. They are said to have been first
exhibited by the Etrurians, and to have had
their origin from the custom of killing slaves
and captives at the funeral pyres of the
deceased. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Bustum">Bustum</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a></span>.] A show of
gladiators was called munus, and the person
who exhibited (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edebat</i>) it, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">editor</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">munerator</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominus</i>, who was honoured during the
day of exhibition, if a private person, with
the official signs of a magistrate. Gladiators
were first exhibited at Rome in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 264, in
the Forum Boarium, by Marcus and Decimus
Brutus, at the funeral of their father. They
were at first confined to public funerals, but
afterwards fought at the funerals of most
persons of consequence, and even at those of
women. Combats of gladiators were also
exhibited at entertainments, and especially at
public festivals by the aediles and other magistrates,
who sometimes exhibited immense
numbers, with the view of pleasing the
people. Under the empire the passion of the
Romans for this amusement rose to its greatest
height, and the number of gladiators who
fought on some occasions appears almost incredible.
After Trajan’s triumph over the
Dacians, there were more than 10,000 exhibited.
Gladiators consisted either of captives,
slaves, and condemned malefactors, or of
freeborn citizens who fought voluntarily.
Freemen, who became gladiators for hire,
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctorati</i>, and their hire <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctoramentum</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gladiatorium</i>. Even under the
republic, free-born citizens fought as gladiators,
but they appear to have belonged only
to the lower orders. Under the empire,
however, both knights and senators fought in
the arena, and even women.&mdash;Gladiators were
kept in schools (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi</i>), where they were trained
by persons called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lanistae</i>. The whole body
of gladiators under one lanista was frequently
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia</i>. They sometimes
were the property of the lanistae, who let
them out to persons who wished to exhibit a
show of gladiators; but at other times they
belonged to citizens, who kept them for the
purpose of exhibition, and engaged lanistae
to instruct them. Thus we read of the ludus
Aemilius at Rome, and of Caesar’s ludus at
Capua. The gladiators fought in these ludi
with wooden swords, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rudes</i>. Great
attention was paid to their diet, in order to
increase the strength of their bodies.&mdash;Gladiators
were sometimes exhibited at the funeral
pyre, and sometimes in the forum, but more
frequently in the amphitheatre. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</a>.</span>]&mdash;The
person who was to exhibit
a show of gladiators, published some days
before the exhibition bills (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libelli</i>), containing
the number and frequently the names of
those who were to fight. When the day
came, they were led along the arena in procession,
and matched by pairs; and their
swords were examined by the editor to see if
they were sufficiently sharp. At first there
was a kind of sham battle, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praelusio</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
in which they fought with wooden swords, or
the like, and afterwards at the sound of the
trumpet the real battle began. When a gladiator
was wounded, the people called out
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habet</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hoc habet</i>; and the one who was
vanquished lowered his arms in token of submission.
His fate, however, depended upon
the people, who pressed down their thumbs if
they wished him to be saved, but turned them
up if they wished him to be killed, and ordered
him to receive the sword (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferrum recipere</i>),
which gladiators usually did with
the greatest firmness. If the life of a vanquished
gladiator was spared, he obtained his
discharge for that day, which was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">missio</i>; and hence in an exhibition of gladiators
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine missione</i>, the lives of the conquered
were never spared. This kind of exhibition,
however, was forbidden by Augustus. Palms
were usually given to the victorious gladiators.
Old gladiators, and sometimes those
who had only fought for a short time, were
discharged from the service by the editor, at
the request of the people, who presented each
of them with a rudis or wooden sword;
whence those who were discharged were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rudiarii</i>.&mdash;Gladiators were divided
into different classes, according to their arms
and different mode of fighting, or other circumstances.
The names of the most important
of these classes are given in alphabetical
order:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Andabatae</i> wore helmets without any
aperture for the eyes, so that they were
obliged to fight blindfold, and thus excited
the mirth of the spectators.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catervarii</i> was
the name given to gladiators when they did
not fight in pairs, but when several fought
together.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Essedarii</i> fought from chariots,
like the Gauls and Britons. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Esseda">Esseda</a>.</span>]&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoplomachi</i>
appear to have been those who fought
in a complete suit of armour.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laqueatores</i>
were those who used a noose to catch their
adversaries.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Meridiani</i> were those who
fought in the middle of the day, after combats
with wild beasts had taken place in the
morning. These gladiators were very slightly
armed.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mirmillones</i> are said to have been so
called from their having the image of a fish
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mormyr</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μορμύρος</span>) on their helmets. Their
arms were like those of the Gauls, whence we
find that they were also called Galli. They
were usually matched with the Retiarii or
Thracians.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Provocatores</i> fought with the
Samnites, but we do not know any thing
respecting them except their name.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Retiarii</i>
carried only a three-pointed lance, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tridens</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscina</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fuscina">Fuscina</a></span>], and a net (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rete</i>),
which they endeavoured to throw over their
adversaries, and they then attacked them
with the fuscina while they were entangled.
The retiarius was dressed in a short tunic,
and wore nothing on his head. If he missed
his aim in throwing the net, he betook himself
to flight, and endeavoured to prepare his
net for a second cast, while his adversary
followed him round the arena in order to kill
him before he could make a second attempt.
His adversary was usually a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secutor</i> or a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mirmillo</i>. In the following woodcut a combat
is represented between a retiarius and a
mirmillo; the former has thrown his net over
the head of the latter, and is proceeding to
attack him with the fuscina. The lanista
stands behind the retiarius.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Samnites</i> were
so called, because they were armed in the
same way as that people, and were particularly
distinguished by the oblong <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutum</i>.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Secutores</i>
are supposed by some writers to be
so called because the secutor in his combat
with the retiarius pursued the latter when
he failed in securing him by his net.</p>

<p>Other writers think that they were the same as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">supposititii</i>, who were gladiators substituted

buckler, and a short sword or dagger
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sica</i>). They were usually matched, as already

each.</p>

sword or glaive, by the Latin poets called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ensis</i>. The ancient sword had generally a
straight two-edged blade, rather broad, and
nearly of equal width from hilt to point.
The Greeks and Romans wore them on the
left side, so as to draw them out of the sheath
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vagina</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κολεός</span>) by passing the right hand
in front of the body to take hold of the
hilt with the thumb next to the blade.
The early Greeks used a very short sword.
Iphicrates, who made various improvements
in armour about 400 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, doubled its length.
The Roman sword was larger, heavier, and
more formidable than the Greek.</p>

<p id="Grammateus">GRAMMĂTEUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραμματεύς</span>), a clerk or
scribe. Among the great number of scribes

rank, who were real state-officers. One of
them was appointed by lot, by the senate, to
serve the time of the administration of each
prytany, though he always belonged to a
different prytany from that which was in
power. He was, therefore, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραμματεὺς

the public records, and the decrees of the
people which were made during the time of

<p id="Gymnasium">GYMNĀSIUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνάσιον</span>). The whole
education of a Greek youth was divided into
three parts,&mdash;grammar, music, and gymnastics
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γράμματα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μουσική</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμναστική</span>), to which
Aristotle adds a fourth, the art of drawing
or painting. Gymnastics, however, were
thought by the ancients a matter of such importance,
that this part of education alone
occupied as much time and attention as all
the others put together; and while the latter
necessarily ceased at a certain period of life,
gymnastics continued to be cultivated by persons
of all ages, though those of an advanced
age naturally took lighter and less fatiguing
exercises than boys and youths. The ancients,
and more especially the Greeks, seem
to have been thoroughly convinced that the
mind could not possibly be in a healthy state,
unless the body was likewise in perfect
health, and no means were thought, either
by philosophers or physicians, to be more
conducive to preserve or restore bodily health
than well-regulated exercise. The word
gymnastics is derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνός</span> (naked),
because the persons who performed their exercises
in public or private gymnasia were
either entirely naked, or merely covered by
the short <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chiton</i>. Gymnastic exercises among
the Greeks seem to have been as old as
the Greek nation itself; but they were, as
might be supposed, of a rude and mostly of a
warlike character. They were generally held
in the open air, and in plains near a river,
which afforded an opportunity for swimming
and bathing. It was about the time of Solon
that the Greek towns began to build their
regular gymnasia as places of exercise for
the young, with baths, and other conveniences
for philosophers and all persons who
sought intellectual amusements. There
was probably no Greek town of any importance
which did not possess its gymnasium.
Athens possessed three great
gymnasia, the Lyceum (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λύκειον</span>), Cynosarges
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κυνόσαργες</span>), and the Academia (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀκαδημία</span>);
to which, in later times, several
smaller ones were added. Respecting the
superintendence and administration of the
gymnasia at Athens, we know that Solon in
his legislation thought them worthy of great
attention; and the transgression of some of
his laws relating to the gymnasia was punished
with death. His laws mention a magistrate,
called the gymnasiarch (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνασίαρχος</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνασιάρχης</span>), who was entrusted with
the whole management of the gymnasia, and
with everything connected therewith. His
office was one of the regular liturgies like the
choregia and trierarchy, and was attended
with considerable expense. He had to maintain
and pay the persons who were preparing
themselves for the games and contests in the
public festivals, to provide them with oil,
and perhaps with the wrestlers’ dust. It also
devolved upon him to adorn the gymnasium,
or the place where the agones were held.
The gymnasiarch was a real magistrate, and
invested with a kind of jurisdiction over all
those who frequented or were connected with
the gymnasia. Another part of his duties
was to conduct the solemn games at certain
great festivals, especially the torch-race
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαμπαδηφορία</span>), for which he selected the
most distinguished among the ephebi of the
gymnasia. The number of gymnasiarchs was
ten, one from every tribe. An office of very
great importance, in an educational point of
view, was that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sophronistae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σωφρονίσται</span>).
Their province was to inspire the
youths with a love of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</span>, and to protect
this virtue against all injurious influences.
In early times their number at Athens
was ten, one from every tribe, with a salary
of one drachma per day. Their duty not
only required them to be present at all the
games of the ephebi, but to watch and correct
their conduct wherever they might meet
them, both within and without the gymnasium.
The instructions in the gymnasia
were given by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gymnastae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνασταί</span>)
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paedotribae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιδοτριβαί</span>); at a later
period <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypopaedotribae</i> were added. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
Paedotribae were required to possess a knowledge
of all the various exercises which were
performed in the gymnasia; the Gymnastes
was the practical teacher, and was expected
to know the physiological effects and influences
on the constitution of the youths, and
therefore assigned to each of them those
exercises which he thought most suitable.
The anointing of the bodies of the youths
and strewing them with dust, before they
commenced their exercises, as well as the
regulation of their diet, was the duty of the
aliptae. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aliptae">Aliptae</a>.</span>]&mdash;Among all the different
tribes of the Greeks the exercises which
were carried on in a Greek gymnasium were
either mere games, or the more important
exercises which the gymnasia had in common
with the public contests in the great
festivals. Among the former we may mention,
1. The game at ball (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαιριστική</span>), which
was in universal favour with the Greeks.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pila">Pila</a>.</span>] Every gymnasium contained one
large room for the purpose of playing at ball
in it (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαιριστήριον</span>). 2. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Παίζειν ἑλκυστίνδα</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διελκυστίνδα</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διὰ γραμμῆς</span>, was a game in
which one boy, holding one end of a rope,
tried to pull the boy who held its other end,
across a line marked between them on the
ground. 3. The top (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βεμβηξ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βέμβιξ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥόμβος</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρόβιλος</span>), which was as common an amusement
with Greek boys as it is with ours.
4. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντάλιθος</span>, which was a game with
five stones, which were thrown up from the
upper part of the hand and caught in the
palm. 5. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σκαπέρδα</span>, which was a game in
which a rope was drawn through the upper
part of a tree or a post. Two boys, one on
each side of the post, turning their backs
towards one another, took hold of the ends
of the rope and tried to pull each other up.
This sport was also one of the amusements at
the Attic Dionysia. The more important
games, such as running (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρόμος</span>), throwing of
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίσκος</span> and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκων</span>, jumping and leaping
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅλμα</span>, with and without <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁλτῆρες</span>), wrestling
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάλη</span>), boxing (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυγμή</span>), the pancratium
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παγκράτιον</span>), <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πένταθλος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαμπαδηφορία</span>, dancing
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀρχήσις</span>), &amp;c., are described in separate
articles. A gymnasium was not a Roman
institution. The regular training of boys in
the Greek gymnastics was foreign to Roman
manners, and even held in contempt. Towards
the end of the republic, many wealthy
Romans who had acquired a taste for Greek
manners, used to attach to their villas small
places for bodily exercise, sometimes called
gymnasia, sometimes palaestrae, and to adorn
them with beautiful works of art. The emperor
Nero was the first who built a public
gymnasium at Rome.</p>


<p id="Gymnesii">GYMNĒSII or GYMNĒTES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνήσιοι</span>, or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνῆτες</span>), a class of bond-slaves at Argos,
who may be compared with the Helots at
Sparta. Their name shows that they attended
their masters on military service in the capacity
of light-armed troops.</p>


<p id="Gymnopaedia">GYMNŎPAEDĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνοπαιδία</span>), the festival
of “naked youths,” was celebrated at
Sparta every year in honour of Apollo Pythaeus,
Artemis, and Leto. The statues of
these deities stood in a part of the agora
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χορός</span>, and it was around these statues
that, at the gymnopaedia, Spartan youths
performed their choruses and dances in honour
of Apollo. The festival lasted for several,
perhaps for ten, days, and on the last day
men also performed choruses and dances in
the theatre; and during these gymnastic
exhibitions they sang the songs of Thaletas
and Alcman, and the paeans of Dionysodotus.
The leader of the chorus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάτης</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χοροποιός</span>)
wore a kind of chaplet in commemoration
of the victory of the Spartans at Thyrea.
This event seems to have been closely connected
with the gymnopaedia, for those Spartans
who had fallen on that occasion were
always praised in songs at this festival.
The boys in their dances performed such
rhythmical movements as resembled the exercises
of the palaestra and the pancration, and
also imitated the wild gestures of the worship
of Dionysus. The whole season of the gymnopaedia,
during which Sparta was visited
by great numbers of strangers, was one of
great merriment and rejoicings, and old
bachelors alone seem to have been excluded
from the festivities. The introduction of the
gymnopaedia is generally assigned to the year
665 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυναικονόμοι</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυναικοκόσμοι</span>), magistrates
at Athens, originally appointed to superintend
the conduct of Athenian women. Their
power was afterwards extended in such a
manner that they became a kind of police for
the purpose of preventing any excesses or
indecencies, whether committed by men or
by women. Hence they superintended the
meetings of friends even in private houses,
for instance, at weddings and on other festive
occasions.</p>

<p id="Halteres" class="drop-capy">HALTĒRES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁλτῆρες</span>) were certain masses

Romans. Persons who practised leaping frequently
performed their exercises with halteres
in both hands; but they were also
frequently used merely to exercise the body<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
in somewhat the same manner as our dumb-bells.</p>

<p id="Harmamaxa">HARMĂMAXA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁρμάμαξα</span>), a carriage for

drawn by four horses, and attired with
splendid ornaments. It occupied among the
Persians the same place which the carpentum

whom the Lacedaemonians, after the Peloponnesian
war, sent into their subject or
conquered towns, partly to keep them in submission,
and partly to abolish the democratical
form of government, and establish in
its stead one similar to their own. Although
in many cases they were ostensibly sent for
the purpose of abolishing the tyrannical
government of a town, and to restore the
people to freedom, yet they themselves acted
like kings or tyrants.</p>

war the grappling-iron, thrown at an enemy’s
ship, seized the rigging, and was then used
to drag the ship within reach, so that it
might be easily boarded or destroyed. These

<p id="Haruspices">HĂRUSPĬCES, or ĂRUSPĬCES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροσκόποι</span>),
soothsayers or diviners, who interpreted
the will of the gods. They originally
came to Rome from Etruria, whence haruspices
were often sent for by the Romans on
important occasions. The art of the haruspices
resembled in many respects that of the
augurs; but they never acquired that political
importance which the latter possessed,
and were regarded rather as means for
ascertaining the will of the gods than as possessing
any religious authority. They did
not in fact form any part of the ecclesiastical
polity of the Roman state during the republic;
they are never called sacerdotes, they did
not form a collegium, and had no magister
at their head. The art of the haruspices,
which was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">haruspicina</i>, consisted in
explaining and interpreting the will of the
gods from the appearance of the entrails
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exta</i>) of animals offered in sacrifice, whence
they are sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extispices</i>, and their
art <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extispicium</i>; and also from lightning,
earthquakes, and all extraordinary phenomena
in nature, to which the general name
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portenta</i> was given. Their art is said to
have been invented by the Etruscan Tages,
and was contained in certain books called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libri haruspicini</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fulgurales</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tonitruales</i>.
This art was considered by the Romans so
important at one time, that the senate decreed
that a certain number of young Etruscans,
belonging to the principal families in
the state, should always be instructed in it.
In later times, however, their art fell into
disrepute among well-educated Romans; and
Cicero relates a saying of Cato, that he wondered
that one haruspex did not laugh when
he saw another. The name of haruspex is
sometimes applied to any kind of soothsayer
or prophet.</p>

  <div class="caption">Hastae, spears.</div>
</div>

<p id="Hasta">HASTA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγχος</span>), a spear. The spear is
defined by Homer, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόρυ χαλκήρες</span>, “a pole
fitted with bronze,” and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόρυ χαλκοβάρες</span>, “a
pole heavy with bronze.” The bronze, for
which iron was afterwards substituted, was
indispensable to form the point (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰχμή</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκωκή</span>,
Homer; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόγχη</span>, Xenophon; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acies</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cuspis</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spiculum</i>) of the spear. Each of these two
essential parts is often put for the whole, so
that a spear is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόρυ</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοράτιον</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰχμή</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόγχη</span>. Even the more especial
term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελία</span>, meaning an ash-tree, is used in
the same manner, because the pole of the
spear was often the stem of a young ash,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
stripped of its bark and polished. The bottom
of the spear was often inclosed in a pointed
cap of bronze, called by the Ionic writers
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαυρωτῆρ</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐρίαχος</span>, and in Attic or common
Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στύραξ</span>. By forcing this into the
ground the spear was fixed erect. Many
of the lancers who accompanied the king of
Persia, had, instead of this spike at the bottom
of their spears, an apple or a pomegranate,
either gilt or silvered. Fig. 1. in the annexed
woodcut shows the top and bottom of
a spear, which is held by one of the king’s
guards in the sculptures at Persepolis. The
spear was used as a weapon of attack in three
different ways:&mdash;1. It was thrown from
catapults and other engines [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tormentum">Tormentum</a></span>].
2. It was thrust forward as a pike. 3. It
was commonly thrown by the hand. The
spear frequently had a leathern thong tied
to the middle of the shaft, which was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγκύλη</span> by the Greeks, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amentum</i> by the
Romans, and which was of assistance in
throwing the spear. The annexed figure
represents the amentum attached to the spear
at the centre of gravity, a little above the
middle.</p>

  <div class="caption">Hasta with Amentum. (From a Painting on a Vase.)</div>
</div>

<p>Under the general terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta</i> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγχος</span> were included various kinds of missiles, of
which the principal were as follow:&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lancea</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόγχη</span>), the lance, a comparatively slender
spear commonly used by the Greek horsemen.
The appendage shown in woodcut, Fig. 2,
enabled them to mount their horses with
greater facility.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pilum</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑσσός</span>), the javelin,
much thicker and stronger than the Grecian
lance. Its shaft, often made of cornel, was
4½ feet (three cubits) long, and the barbed
iron head was of the same length, but this
extended half way down the shaft, to which
it was attached with extreme care, so that
the whole length of the weapon was about
6 feet 9 inches. It was used either to throw
or to thrust with; it was peculiar to the
Romans, and gave the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pilani</i> to the
division of the army by which it was adopted.&mdash;Whilst
the heavy-armed Roman soldiers bore
the long lance and the thick and ponderous
javelin, the light-armed used smaller missiles,
which, though of different kinds, were included
under the general term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hastae velitares</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γρόσφοι</span>). The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γρόσφος</span> was a dart, with a
shaft about three feet long and an inch in
thickness: the iron head was a span long,
and so thin and acuminated as to be bent by
striking against anything, and thus rendered
unfit to be sent back against the enemy.
Fig. 3, in the preceding woodcut, shows one
which was found in a Roman entrenchment
in Gloucestershire.&mdash;The light infantry of the
Roman army used a similar weapon, called
<em>a spit</em> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veru</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verutum</i>; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαύνιον</span>). It was
adopted by them from the Samnites and the
Volsci. Its shaft was 3½ feet long, its point
5 inches. Fig. 4, in the preceding woodcut,
represents the head of a dart in the Royal
Collection at Naples; it may be taken as a
specimen of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verutum</i>, and may be contrasted
with fig. 5, which is the head of a
lance in the same collection.&mdash;The Romans
adopted in like manner the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gaesum</i>, which
was properly a Celtic weapon; it was given
as a reward to any soldier who wounded an
enemy. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Gaesum">Gaesum</a>.</span>]&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sparus</i> is evidently the
same word with the English <em>spar</em> and <em>spear</em>.
It was the rudest missile of the whole class.&mdash;Besides
the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jaculum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spiculum</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκων</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκόντιον</span>), which probably denoted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
darts, resembling in form the lance and
javelin, but much smaller, adapted consequently
to the light-armed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jaculatores</i>), and
used in hunting as well as in battle, we find
in classical authors the names of various
other spears, which were characteristic of
particular nations.&mdash;Thus, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sarissa</i> was
the spear peculiar to the Macedonians. This
was used both to throw and as a pike. It
exceeded in length all other missiles.&mdash;The
Thracian <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">romphea</i>, which had a very long
point, like the blade of a sword, was probably
not unlike the sarissa.&mdash;With these
weapons we may also class the Illyrian <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sibina</i>,
which resembled a hunting-pole.&mdash;The iron
head of the German spear, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">framea</i>, was
short and narrow, but very sharp. The
Germans used it with great effect either as a
lance or a pike: they gave to each youth a
framea and a shield on coming of age.&mdash;The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falarica</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phalarica</i> was the spear of the
Saguntines, and was impelled by the aid of
twisted ropes; it was large and ponderous,
having a head of iron a cubit in length, and
a ball of lead at its other end; it sometimes
carried flaming pitch and tow.&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">matura</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tragula</i> were chiefly used in Gaul and
Spain: the tragula was probably barbed, as
it required to be cut out of the wound.&mdash;The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aclis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cateia</i> were much smaller missiles.&mdash;<span id="Hasta_p">Among</span>
the decorations which the Roman
generals bestowed on their soldiers, more
especially for saving the life of a fellow-citizen,
was a spear without a head, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta pura</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">celibaris hasta</i>, having
been fixed into the body of a gladiator lying
dead on the arena, was used at marriages to
part the hair of the bride. A spear was
erected at auctions [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Auctio">Auctio</a></span>], and when tenders
were received for public offices (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locationes</i>).
It served both to announce, by a
conventional sign conspicuous at a distance,
that a sale was going on, and to show that it
was conducted under the authority of the
public functionaries. Hence an auction was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hasta</i>, and an auction-room <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hastarium</i>.

the court of the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Centumviri">Centumviri</a></span>.</p>

<p id="Hecte">HECTĒ or HECTEUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕκτη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκτεύς</span>), and
its half, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemiecton</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemiecteon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμίεκτον</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμιεκτέον</span>). In dry measures, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hecteus</i> was
the sixth part of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">medimnus</i>, and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hemiecteon</i>, of course, the twelfth part. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hecteus</i> was equal to the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modius</i>, as
each contained 16 <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξέσται</span> or sextarii. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hecte</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hecteus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemiecton</i> were also
the names of coins, but the accounts we have
of their value are very various. The only
consistent explanation is, that there were
different <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hectae</i>, derived from different units;
in fact, that these coins were not properly
<em>denominations</em> of money, but <em>subdivisions</em> of
the recognised denominations.</p>


<p id="Helepolis">HĔLĔPŎLIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑλέπολις</span>), “the taker of
cities,” a machine constructed by Demetrius
Poliorcetes, when he besieged the city of
Salamis in Cyprus. Its form was that of
a square tower, each side being 90 cubits
high and 45 wide. It rested on four
wheels, each eight cubits high. It was
divided into nine stories, the lower of which
contained machines for throwing great
stones, the middle large catapults for throwing
spears, and the highest other machines
for throwing smaller stones, together with
smaller catapults. It was manned with 200
soldiers, besides those who moved it by pushing
the parallel beams at the bottom. At
the siege of Rhodes, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 306, Demetrius
employed an helepolis of still greater dimensions
and more complicated construction.
In subsequent ages we find the name of
“helepolis” applied to moving towers which
carried battering rams, as well as machines
for throwing spears and stones.</p>


<p id="Hellanodicae">HELLĀNŎDĬCAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑλλανοδίκαι</span>), the judges
in the Olympic games, of whom an account
is given under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Olympia">Olympia</a></span>. The same name
was also given to the judges or court-martial
in the Lacedaemonian army, and they were
probably first called by this name when Sparta
was at the head of the Greek confederacy.</p>


<p id="Hellenotamiae">HELLĒNOTĂMĬAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑλληνοταμίαι</span>), or
treasurers of the Greeks, were magistrates
appointed by the Athenians to receive the
contributions of the allied states. They
were first appointed <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 477, when Athens,
in consequence of the conduct of Pausanias,
had obtained the command of the allied
states. The money paid by the different
states, which was originally fixed at 460
talents, was deposited in Delos, which was
the place of meeting for the discussion of all
common interests; and there can be no doubt
that the hellenotamiae not only received, but
were also the guardians of, these monies.
The office was retained after the treasury
was transferred to Athens on the proposal of
the Samians, but was of course abolished on
the conquest of Athens by the Lacedaemonians.</p>


<p id="Helotes">HĒLŌTES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἴλωτες</span>), a class of bondsmen
peculiar to Sparta. They were Achaeans,
who had resisted the Dorian invaders to the
last, and had been reduced to slavery as the
punishment of their obstinacy. The Helots
were regarded as the property of the state,
which, while it gave their services to individuals,
reserved to itself the power of emancipating
them. They were attached to the
land, and could not be sold away from it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
They cultivated the land, and paid to their
masters as rent a certain measure of corn, the
exact amount of which had been fixed at a
very early period, the raising of that amount
being forbidden under heavy imprecations.
Besides being engaged in the cultivation of
the land, the Helots attended on their masters
at the public meal, and many of them
were no doubt employed by the state in public
works. In war the Helots served as
light-armed troops (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψίλοι</span>), a certain number
of them attending every heavy-armed Spartan
to the field; at the battle of Plataeae there
were seven Helots to each Spartan. These
attendants were probably called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμπίτταρες</span>
(i.e. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίσταντες</span>), and one of them in particular,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεράπων</span>, or <em>servant</em>. The Helots
only served as hoplites in particular emergencies;
and on such occasions they were
generally emancipated. The first instance
of this kind was in the expedition of Brasidas,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 424. The treatment to which
the Helots were subjected was marked by the
most wanton cruelty; and they were regarded
by the Spartans with the greatest suspicion.
Occasionally the ephors selected young Spartans
for the secret service (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρυπτεία</span>) of wandering
over the country, in order to kill the
Helots. The Helots might be emancipated,
but there were several steps between them
and the free citizens, and it is doubtful
whether they were ever admitted to all the
privileges of citizenship. The following
classes of emancipated Helots are enumerated:&mdash;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀφεταί</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδεσπότοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐρυκτῆρες</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεσποσιοναύται</span>,
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεοδαμώδεις</span>. Of these the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀφεταί</span> were probably released from all service;
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐρυκτῆρες</span> were those employed in
war; the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεσποσιοναύται</span> served on board the
fleet; and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεοδαμώδεις</span> were those who
had been possessed of freedom for some time.
Besides these, there were the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόθωνες</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόθακες</span>, who were domestic slaves, brought
up with the young Spartans, and then emancipated.
Upon being emancipated they
received permission to dwell where they
wished.</p>


<p id="Hemerodromi">HĒMĔRŎDRŎMI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμεροδρόμοι</span>), couriers
in the Greek states, who could keep on running
all day, and were often employed to
carry news of important events. They were
trained for the purpose, and could perform
the longest journeys in an almost incredibly
short space of time. Such couriers were in
times of danger stationed on some eminence
in order to observe anything of importance
that might happen, and carry the intelligence
with speed to the proper quarter. Hence we
frequently find them called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemeroscopi</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμεροσκόποι</span>).</p>


<p id="Hemicyclium">HĒMĬCYCLĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμικύκλιον</span>), a semicircular
seat, for the accommodation of persons
engaged in conversation; also the semicircular
seat round the tribunal in a basilica.</p>


<p id="Hemina">HĒMĬNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμίνα</span>), the name of a Greek
and Roman measure, seems to be nothing
more than the dialectic form used by the
Sicilian and Italian Greeks for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμίσυ</span>. It
was therefore applied to the half of the
standard fluid measure, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξέστης</span>, which the
other Greeks called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοτύλη</span>, and the word
passed into the Roman metrical system,
where it is used with exactly the same force,
namely for a measure which is half of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sextarius</i>, and equal to the Greek <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cotylé</i>.</p>


<p id="Hendeca">HENDĔCA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ ἕνδεκα</span>), the Eleven, were
magistrates at Athens of considerable importance.
They were annually chosen by lot,
one from each of the ten tribes, and a secretary
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραμματεύς</span>), who must properly be regarded
as their servant (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπηρέτης</span>), though he
formed one of their number. The principal
duty of the Eleven was the care and management
of the public prison (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεσμωτήριον</span>),
which was entirely under their jurisdiction.
The prison, however, was seldom used by the
Athenians as a mere place of confinement,
serving generally for punishments and executions.
When a person was condemned to
death he was immediately given into the
custody of the Eleven, who were then bound
to carry the sentence into execution according
to the laws. The most common mode of
execution was by hemlock juice (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κώνειον</span>),
which was drunk after sunset. The Eleven
had under them gaolers, executioners, and
torturers. When torture was inflicted in
causes affecting the state, it was either done
in the immediate presence of the Eleven, or
by their servant (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ δήμιος</span>). The Eleven
usually had only to carry into execution the
sentence passed in the courts of law and the
public assemblies; but in some cases they
possessed jurisdiction. This was the case in
those summary proceedings called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apagoge</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ephegesis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">endeixis</i>, in which the penalty
was fixed by law, and might be inflicted by
the court on the confession or conviction of
the accused, without appealing to any of the
jury courts.</p>

<p id="Hephaesteia">HĒPHAESTEIA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lampadephoria">Lampadephoria</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Heraea">HĒRAEA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡραῖα</span>), the name of festivals
celebrated in honour of Hera in all the towns
of Greece where the worship of this divinity
was introduced. The original seat of her
worship was Argos; whence her festivals in
other places were, more or less, imitations of
those which were celebrated at Argos. Her
service was performed by the most distinguished
priestesses of the place; one of them
was the high-priestess, and the Argives
counted their years by the date of her office.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
The Heraea of Argos were celebrated every
fifth year. One of the great solemnities
which took place on the occasion, was a magnificent
procession to the great temple of
Hera, between Argos and Mycenae. A vast
number of young men assembled at Argos,
and marched in armour to the temple of the
goddess. They were preceded by one hundred
oxen (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκατόμβη</span>, whence the festival is
also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκατόμβαια</span>). The high-priestess
accompanied this procession, riding in a chariot
drawn by two white oxen. The 100
oxen were sacrificed, and their flesh distributed
among all the citizens; after which
games and contests took place. Of the Heraea
celebrated in other countries, those of
Samos, which island derived the worship of
Hera from Argos, were perhaps the most
brilliant of all the festivals of this divinity.
The Heraea of Elis, which were celebrated
in the fourth year of every Olympiad, were
also conducted with considerable splendour.</p>


<p id="Heres">HĒRES.&mdash;(1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span> To obtain the right
of inheritance as well as citizenship at Athens
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγχιστεία</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολιτεία</span>), legitimacy was a
necessary qualification. When an Athenian
died leaving legitimate sons, they shared the
inheritance, like our heirs in gavelkind; the
only advantage possessed by the eldest son
being the first choice in the division. Every
man of full age and sound mind, not under
durance or improper influence, was competent
to make a will; but if he had a son he
could not disinherit him, although his will
might take effect in case the son did not
complete his seventeenth year. If there was
but one son, he took the whole estate; but
if he had sisters, it was incumbent on him to
provide for them, and give them suitable
marriage portions; they were then called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίπροικοι</span>. On failure of sons and their issue,
daughters and daughters’ children succeeded,
and there seems to have been no limit to the
succession in the descending line. It will
assist the student to be informed, that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνεψιός</span>
signifies a first cousin. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀνεψιαδοῦς</span> is a first
cousin’s son; formed in the same manner as
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδελφιδοῦς</span> from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀδελφός</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυγατριδοῦς</span> from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυγατήρ</span>. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κλῆρος</span> is the subject-matter of
inheritance, or (in one sense of the word)
the inheritance; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κληρόνομος</span> the heir. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀγχιστεία</span>,
proximity of blood in reference to
succession, and sometimes right of succession.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συγγένεια</span>, natural consanguinity. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συγγενεῖς</span>,
collateral relations, are opposed to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔκγονοι</span>, lineal descendants.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span>
A person might become an heres by being
named as such (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">institutus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">factus</i>)
in a will executed by a competent person,
according to the forms required by law [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Testamentum">Testamentum</a></span>].
The testator might either name
one person as heres, or he might name
several heredes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coheredes</i>), and he might
divide the hereditas among them as he
pleased. The shares of the heredes were
generally expressed by reference to the divisions
of the As: thus, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">heres ex asse</span>” is
heres to the whole property; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">heres ex
dodrante</span>,” heres to three-fourths; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">heres
ex semuncia</span>,” heir to one twenty-fourth.
If there were several heredes named, without
any definite shares being given to them, the
property belonged to them in equal shares.
As a general rule, only Roman citizens could
be named as heredes in the will of a Roman
citizen; but a slave could also be named
heres, though he had no power to make a
will, and a filius-familias could also be named
heres, though he was under the same incapacity.
Persons, not Roman citizens, who
had received the commercium, could take
hereditates, legata and fideicommissa by testament.&mdash;Heredes
were either Necessarii, Sui
et Necessarii, or Extranei. The heres necessarius
was a slave of the testator, who was
made an heres and liber at the same time;
and he was called necessarius, because of the
necessity that he was under of accepting the
hereditas. The heredes sui et necessarii
were sons and daughters, and the sons and
daughters of a son, who were in the power
of a testator. These heredes sui were called
necessarii, because of the necessity that they
were under, according to the civil law, of
taking the hereditas with its incumbrances.
But the praetor permitted such persons to
refuse the hereditas (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abstinere se ab hereditate</i>),
and to allow the property to be sold
to pay the testator’s debts; and he gave
the same privilege to a mancipated son
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui in causa mancipii est</i>). All other
heredes are called extranei, and comprehend
all persons who are not in the power
of a testator, such as emancipated children.
A certain time was allowed to extranei
for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cretio hereditatis</i>, that is, for
them to determine whether they would take
the hereditas or not: hence the phrase,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cernere hereditatem</span>.”&mdash;If a man died
intestate, the hereditas came to the heredes
sui, and was then called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legitima hereditas</i>.
If an intestate had no sui heredes, the Twelve
Tables gave the hereditas to the agnati [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cognati">Cognati</a></span>],
and if there were no agnati, to the
gentiles. If a man had a son in his power,
he was bound either to make him heres, or
to exheredate (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exheredare</i>) him expressly
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nominatim</i>). If he passed him over in
silence (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silentio praetericrit</i>), the will was
altogether void (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inutile</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non jure factum</i>).
Other liberi could be passed over, and the
will would still be a valid will; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
liberi so passed over took a certain portion
of the hereditas <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adcrescendo</i>, as it was
termed, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure adcrescendi</i>. It was necessary
either to institute as heredes, or to exheredate
posthumous children <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nominatim</i>, otherwise
the will, which was originally valid,
became invalid (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ruptum</i>); and the will became
invalid by the birth either of a posthumous
son or daughter, or, as the phrase was,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adgnascendo rumpitur testamentum</i>. The
heres represented the testator and intestate,
and had not only a claim to all his property
and all that was due to him, but was bound
by all his obligations. He succeeded to the
sacra privata, and was bound to maintain
them, but only in respect of the property, for
the obligation of the sacra privata was
attached to property and to the heres only
as the owner of it. Hence the expression
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine sacris hereditas</span>” meant an hereditas
unencumbered with sacra.</p>


<p id="Hermae">HERMAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμαῖ</span>), and the diminutive
Hermuli (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμίδια</span>), statues composed of a
head, usually that of the god Hermes, placed
on a quadrangular pillar, the height of which
corresponds to the stature of the human
body. Such statues were very numerous
at Athens. So great was the demand
for these works that the words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμογλύφος</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμογλυφικὴ τέχνη</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμογλυφεῖον</span>,
were used as the generic terms for a sculptor,
his art, and his studio. Houses in
Athens had one of these statues placed at
the door, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑρμῆς στροφαῖος</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στροφεύς</span>;
and sometimes also in the peristyle. The
great reverence attached to them is shown
by the alarm and indignation which were
felt at Athens in consequence of the mutilation
of the whole number in a single night,
just before the sailing of the Sicilian expedition.
They were likewise placed in front
of temples, near to tombs, in the gymnasia,
palaestrae, libraries, porticoes, and public
places, at the corners of streets, on high
roads as sign-posts, with distances inscribed
upon them, and on the boundaries of lands
and states, and at the gates of cities. Small
Hermae were also used as pilasters, and as
supports for furniture and utensils. Many
statues existed of other deities, of the same
form as the Hermae; which no doubt originated
in the same manner; and which
were still called by the generic name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermae</i>; even though the bust upon them
was that of another deity. Some statues of
this kind are described by a name compounded
of that of Hermes and another divinity:
thus we have <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermanubis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermares</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermathena</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermeracles</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermeros</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermopan</i>.
There is another class of these works, in
which the bust represented no deity at all,
but was simply the portrait of a man. Even
these statues, however, retained the names
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hermae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Termini</i>. The Hermae were
used by the wealthy Romans for the decoration
of their houses. The following engraving exhibits
a Hermes decorated with garlands and
surrounded with the implements of his worship.</p>

<p id="Hermaea">HERMAEA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕρμαια</span>), festivals of Hermes,
celebrated in various parts of Greece. As
Hermes was the tutelary deity of the gymnasia
and palaestrae, the boys at Athens celebrated
the Hermaea in the gymnasia.</p>


<p id="Hestiasis">HESTIĀSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑστίασις</span>), was a species of
liturgy, and consisted in giving a feast to
one of the tribes at Athens (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὴν φυλὴν ἑστιᾶν</span>).
It was provided for each tribe at the expense
of a person belonging to that tribe, who was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑστιάτωρ</span>.</p>


<p id="Hieroduli">HĬĔRODŪLI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερόδουλοι</span>), persons of both
sexes, who were devoted like slaves to the
worship of the gods. They were of Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
origin, and are most frequently met with in
connection with the worship of the deities of
Syria, Phoenicia, and Asia Minor. They
consisted of two classes; one composed of
slaves, properly so called, who attended to
all the lower duties connected with the worship
of the gods, cultivated the sacred lands,
&amp;c., and whose descendants continued in the
same servile condition; and the other comprising
persons who were personally free,
but had dedicated themselves as slaves to the
gods, and who were either attached to the
temples, or were dispersed throughout the
country and brought to the gods the money
they had gained. To the latter class belonged
the women, who prostituted their persons,
and presented to the gods the money they
had obtained by this means. This class was
only found in Greece, in connection with the
worship of those divinities who were of
Eastern origin, or whose religious rites were
borrowed from the East. This was the case
with Aphrodite (Venus), who was originally
an Oriental goddess.</p>


<p id="Hieromnemones">HĬĔRŎMNĒMŎNES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερομνήμονες</span>), the

council. An account of them is given under
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amphictyones">Amphictyones</a></span>.&mdash;We also read of hieromnemones
in Grecian states, distinct from the
Amphictyonic representatives of this name.
Thus the priests of Poseidon, at Megara, were
called hieromnemones, and at Byzantium,
which was a colony of Megara, the chief
magistrate in the state appears to have been
called by this name.</p>

<p id="Hippobotae">HIPPŎBŎTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱπποβόται</span>), the feeders of
horses, the name of the nobility of Chalcis in
Euboea, corresponding to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππεῖς</span> in other
Greek states.</p>


<p id="Hippodromus">HIPPŎDRŎMUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππόδρομος</span>), the name
by which the Greeks designated the place appropriated
to the horse-races, both of chariots
and of single horses, which formed a part of
their games. The word was also applied to
the races themselves. In Homer’s vivid description
(<cite>Il.</cite> xxiii., 262-650) the nature of
the contest and the arrangements for it are
very clearly indicated. There is no artificially
constructed hippodrome; but an existing
land-mark or monument (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σῆμα</span>) is chosen as
the goal (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέρμα</span>), round which the chariots
had to pass, leaving it on the left hand, and
so returning to the Greek ships on the sea-shore,
from which they had started. The
chariots were five in number, each with two
horses and a single driver, who stood upright
in his chariot. The critical point of the race
was to turn the goal as sharp as possible,
with the nave of the near wheel almost
grazing it, and to do this safely: very often
the driver was here thrown out, and the
chariot broken in pieces. The account in
Homer will give us an equally good idea of a
chariot-race at Olympia, or in any other of the
Greek games of later times. The general form
of the hippodrome was an oblong, with a
semicircular end. For an account of the
chariot races at Rome see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus">Circus</a></span>.</p>


<p id="Histrio">HISTRĬO (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποκριτής</span>), an actor.&mdash;(1)
<span class="smcap">Greek</span>. It is shown in the articles <span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a></span>
and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Dionysia">Dionysia</a></span> that the Greek drama originated
in the chorus which at the festivals of
Dionysus danced around his altar, and that
at first one person detached himself from the
chorus, and, with mimic gesticulation, related
his story either to the chorus or in conversation
with it. If the story thus acted
required more than one person, they were all
represented in succession by the same actor,
and there was never more than one person on
the stage at a time. This custom was retained
by Thespis and Phrynichus. Aeschylus
introduced a second and a third actor;
and the number of three actors was but seldom
exceeded in any Greek drama. The
three regular actors were distinguished by
the technical names of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρωταγωνιστής</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δευτεραγωνιστής</span>,
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριταγωνιστής</span>, which indicated
the more or less prominent part which an
actor had to perform in the drama. The female
characters of a play were always performed
by young men. A distinct class of persons,
who made acting on the stage their profession,
was unknown to the Greeks during the
period of their great dramatists. The earliest
and greatest dramatic poets, Thespis, Sophocles,
and probably Aeschylus also, acted in
their own plays, and in all probability as
protagonistae. It was not thought degrading
in Greece to perform on the stage. At
a later period persons began to devote themselves
exclusively to the profession of actors,
and distinguished individuals received even
as early as the time of Demosthenes exorbitant
sums for their performances.&mdash;(2)
<span class="smcap">Roman.</span> The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">histrio</i>, by which the
Roman actor was called, is said to have been
formed from the Etruscan <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hister</i>, which signified
a ludio or dancer. In the year 364
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Rome was visited by a plague, and as no
human means could stop it, the Romans are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
said to have tried to avert the anger of the
gods by scenic plays (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi scenici</i>), which,
until then, had been unknown to them; and
as there were no persons at Rome prepared
for such performances, the Romans sent to
Etruria for them. The first histriones, who
were thus introduced from Etruria, were
dancers, and performed their movements to
the accompaniment of a flute. Roman youths
afterwards not only imitated these dancers,
but also recited rude and jocose verses,
adapted to the movements of the dance and
the melody of the flute. This kind of amusement,
which was the basis of the Roman
drama, remained unaltered until the time of
Livius Andronicus, who introduced a slave
upon the stage for the purpose of singing or
reciting the recitative, while he himself performed
the appropriate dance and gesticulation.
A further step in the development of
the drama, which is likewise ascribed to
Livius, was, that the dancer and reciter
carried on a dialogue, and acted a story with
the accompaniment of the flute. The name
histrio, which originally signified a dancer,
was now applied to the actors in the drama.
The atellanae were played by freeborn Romans,
while the regular drama was left to
the histriones, who formed a distinct class of
persons. The histriones were not citizens;
they were not contained in the tribes, nor
allowed to be enlisted as soldiers in the
Roman legions; and if any citizen entered
the profession of an histrio, he, on this account,
was excluded from his tribe. The
histriones were therefore always either freedmen,
strangers, or slaves, and many passages
of Roman writers show that they were generally
held in great contempt. Towards the
close of the republic it was only such men as
Cicero, who, by their Greek education, raised
themselves above the prejudices of their
countrymen, and valued the person no less
than the talents of an Aesopus and a Roscius.
But notwithstanding this low estimation
in which actors were generally held,
distinguished individuals among them attracted
immense crowds to the theatres, and
were exorbitantly paid. Roscius alone received
every day that he performed one
thousand denarii, and Aesopus left his son a
fortune of 200,000 sesterces, which he had
acquired solely by his profession. The pay
of the actors was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucar</i>, which word
was perhaps confined originally to the payment
made to those who took part in the
religious services celebrated in groves.</p>


<p id="Homoei">HŎMOEI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅμοιοι</span>), the Equals, were those
Spartans who possessed the full rights of
citizenship, and are opposed to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπομείονες</span>,
or those who had undergone some kind of
civil degradation. This distinction between
the citizens was no part of the ancient Spartan
constitution. In the institution ascribed
to Lycurgus, every citizen had a certain portion
of land; but as in course of time many
citizens lost their lands through various
causes, they were unable to contribute to the
expenses of the syssitia, and therefore ceased
to possess the full rights of Spartan citizens.
Hence the distinction appears to have arisen
between the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅμοιοι</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπομείονες</span>, the former
being those who were in the possession of
their land, and consequently able to contribute
to the syssitia, the latter those who
through having no land were unable to do so.
The Homoei were the ruling class in the
state. They filled all the public offices with
the exception of the Ephoralty, and they probably
met together to determine upon public
affairs under the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔκκλητοι</span> in an assembly
of their own, which is called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡ μικρὰ
ἐκκλησία</span>, to distinguish it from the assembly
of the whole body of Spartan citizens.</p>


<p id="Honores">HŎNŌRES, the high offices of the state to
which qualified individuals were called by the
votes of the Roman citizens. The words
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magistratus</span>” and “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">honores</span>” are sometimes
coupled together. The capacity of enjoying
the honores was one of the distinguishing
marks of citizenship. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Civitas">Civitas</a>.</span>] <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Honor</i> was
distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">munus</i>. The latter was
an office connected with the administration of
the state, and was attended with cost (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sumptus</i>)
but not with rank (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dignitas</i>). Honor
was properly said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deferri, dari</i>; munus was
said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imponi</i>. A person who held a magistrates
might be said to discharge <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">munera</i>,
but only as incident to the office, for the
office itself was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">honor</i>. Such munera as
these were public games and other things of
the kind.</p>

<p id="Horologium">HŌRŎLŎGĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὡρολόγιον</span>), the name of
the various instruments by means of which
the ancients measured the time of the day
and night. The earliest and simplest horologia
of which mention is made, were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">polos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόλος</span>) and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gnomon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γνώμων</span>). Both
divided the day into twelve equal parts, and
were a kind of sun-dial. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gnomon</i>, which
was also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stoicheion</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στοιχεῖον</span>), was the
more simple of the two, and probably the
more ancient. It consisted of a staff or pillar
standing perpendicular, in a place exposed to
the sun (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκιάθηρον</span>), so that the length of its
shadow might be easily ascertained. The
shadow of the gnomon was measured by feet,
which were probably marked on the place
where the shadow fell. In later times the
name gnomon was applied to any kind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
sun-dial, especially to its finger which threw
the shadow, and thus pointed to the hour.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">polos</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heliotropion</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡλιοτρόπιον</span>), on the
other hand, seems to have been a more perfect
kind of sun-dial; but it appears, nevertheless,
not to have been much used. It
consisted of a basin (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λεκανίς</span>), in the middle
of which the perpendicular staff or finger
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γνώμων</span>) was erected, and in it the twelve
parts of the day were marked by lines.&mdash;Another
kind of horologium, was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clepsydra</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλεψύδρα</span>). It derived its name from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλέπτειν</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ</span>, as in its original and
simple form it consisted of a vessel with
several little openings (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρυπήματα</span>) at the
bottom, through which the water contained
in it escaped, as it were by stealth. This instrument
seems at first to have been used
only for the purpose of measuring the time
during which persons were allowed to speak
in the courts of justice at Athens. It was a
hollow globe, probably somewhat flat at the
top-part, where it had a short neck (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλός</span>),
like that of a bottle, through which the water
was poured into it. This opening might be
closed by a lid or stopper (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πῶμα</span>), to prevent
the water running out at the bottom. As
the time for speaking in the Athenian courts
was thus measured by water, the orators frequently
use the term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕδωρ</span> instead of the time
allowed to them. An especial officer (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἐφ’
ὕδωρ</span>) was appointed in the courts for the
purpose of watching the clepsydra, and stopping
it when any documents were read,
whereby the speaker was interrupted. The
time, and consequently the quantity of water
allowed to a speaker, depended upon the importance
of the case. The clepsydra used, in
the courts of justice was, properly speaking,
no horologium; but smaller ones, made of
glass, and of the same simple structure, were
undoubtedly used very early in families for
the purposes of ordinary life, and for dividing
the day into twelve equal parts. In these
glass-clepsydrae the division into twelve
parts must have been visible, either on the
glass globe itself, or in the basin into which
the water flowed.&mdash;The first horologium with
which the Romans became acquainted was a
sun-dial (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solarium</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horologium sciothericum</i>),
and was said to have been brought to
Rome by Papirius Cursor twelve years before
the war with Pyrrhus. But as sun-dials
were useless when the sky was cloudy, P.
Scipio Nasica, in his censorship, 159 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
established a public clepsydra, which indicated
the hours both of day and night. This
clepsydra was in after times generally called
solarium. After the time of Scipio Nasica
several horologia, chiefly solaria, seem to
have been erected in various public places at
Rome. Clepsydrae were used by the Romans
in their camps, chiefly for the purpose of
measuring accurately the four vigiliae into
which the night was divided. The custom
of using clepsydrae as a check upon the
speakers in the courts of justice at Rome,
was introduced by a law of Cn. Pompeius, in
his third consulship. Before that time the
speakers had been under no restrictions, but
spoke as long as they deemed proper. At
Rome, as at Athens, the time allowed to the
speakers depended upon the importance of
the case.</p>


<p id="Horreum">HORRĔUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὡρεῖον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτοφυλακεῖον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποθήκη</span>)
was, according to its etymological signification,
a place in which ripe fruits, and
especially corn, were kept, and thus answered
to our granary. During the empire
the name horreum was given to any place
destined for the safe preservation of things of
any kind. Thus we find it applied to a place
in which beautiful works of art were kept,
to cellars (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horrea subterranea</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horrea vinaria</i>),
to depôts for merchandise, and all sorts of
provisions (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horreum penarium</i>). Seneca even
calls his library a horreum. But the more
general application of the word horreum was
to places for keeping fruit and corn; and as
some kinds of fruit required to be kept more
dry than others, the ancients had besides the
horrea subterranea, or cellars, two other
kinds, one of which was built like every other
house upon the ground; but others (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horrea
pensilia</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sublimia</i>) were erected above the
ground, and rested upon posts or stone
pillars, that the fruits kept in them might
remain dry.&mdash;From about the year 140 after
Christ, Rome possessed two kinds of public
horrea. The one class consisted of buildings
in which the Romans might deposit their
goods, and even their money, securities, and
other valuables. The second and more important
class of horrea, which may be termed
public granaries, were buildings in which a
plentiful supply of corn was constantly kept
at the expense of the state, and from which,
in seasons of scarcity, the corn was distributed
among the poor, or sold at a moderate
price.</p>


<p id="Hortus">HORTUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κῆπος</span>), garden. Our knowledge
of the horticulture of the Greeks is very
limited. In fact the Greeks seem to have
had no great taste for landscape beauties, and
the small number of flowers with which they
were acquainted afforded but little inducement
to ornamental horticulture. At Athens
the flowers most cultivated were probably
those used for making garlands, such as violets
and roses. In the time of the Ptolemies
the art of gardening seems to have advanced
in the favourable climate of Egypt so far,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
that a succession of flowers was obtained all
the year round. The Romans, like the
Greeks, laboured under the disadvantage of a
very limited flora. This disadvantage they
endeavoured to overcome, by arranging the
materials they did possess in such a way as
to produce a striking effect. We have a very
full description of a Roman garden in a
letter of the younger Pliny, in which he describes
his Tuscan villa. In front of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porticus</i> there was generally a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">xystus</i>, or flat
piece of ground, divided into flower-beds of
different shapes by borders of box. There
were also such flower-beds in other parts of
the garden. Sometimes they were raised so
as to form terraces, and their sloping sides
planted with evergreens or creepers. The
most striking features of a Roman garden
were lines of large trees, among which the
plane appears to have been a great favourite,
planted in regular order; alleys or walks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ambulationes</i>)
formed by closely clipped hedges
of box, yew, cypress, and other evergreens;
beds of acanthus, rows of fruit-trees, especially
of vines, with statues, pyramids, fountains,
and summer-houses (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diaetae</i>). The
trunks of the trees and the parts of the house
or any other buildings which were visible
from the garden, were often covered with
ivy. In one respect the Roman taste differed
most materially from that of the present day,
namely, in their fondness for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars topiaria</i>,
which consisted in tying, twisting, or
cutting trees and shrubs (especially the box)
into the figures of animals, ships, letters, &amp;c.
Their principal garden-flowers seem to have
been violets and roses, and they also had the
crocus, narcissus, lily, gladiolus, iris, poppy,
amaranth, and others. Conservatories and
hot-houses are frequently mentioned by Martial.
Flowers and plants were also kept in
the central place of the peristyle [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Domus">Domus</a></span>],
on the roofs and in the windows of houses.
An ornamental garden was also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viridarium</i>,
and the gardener <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">topiarius</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viridarius</i>.
The common name for a gardener is villicus
or cultor hortorum.</p>

<p id="Hospitium">HOSPĬTĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενία</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προξενία</span>), hospitality,
was in Greece, as well as at Rome, of a two-fold
nature, either private or public, in so
far as it was either established between individuals,
or between two states. (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hospitium
privatum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hospitium publicum</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενία</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προξενία</span>.) In ancient Greece the stranger,
as such (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξένος</span> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hostis</i>), was looked upon
as an enemy; but whenever he appeared
among another tribe or nation without any
sign of hostile intentions, he was considered
not only as one who required aid, but as a
suppliant, and Zeus was the protecting deity
of strangers and suppliants (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζεὺς ξένιος</span>). On
his arrival, therefore, the stranger was kindly
received, and provided with every thing necessary
to make him comfortable. It seems
to have been customary for the host, on the
departure of the stranger, to break a die
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστράγαλος</span>) in two, one half of which he
himself retained, while the other half was
given to the stranger; and when at any
future time they or their descendants met,
they had a means of recognising each other,
and the hospitable connection was renewed.
Hospitality thus not only existed between the
persons who had originally formed it, but
was transferred as an inheritance from father
to son. What has been said hitherto, only
refers to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hospitium privatum</i>; but of far
greater importance was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hospitium publicum</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προξενία</span>, sometimes simply <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενία</span>) or
public hospitality, which existed between two
states, or between an individual or a family
on the one hand, and a whole state on the
other. Of the latter kind of public hospitality
many instances are recorded, such as that
between the Peisistratids and Sparta, in
which the people of Athens had no share.
The hospitium publicum among the Greeks
arose undoubtedly from the hospitium privatum,
and it may have originated in two ways.
When the Greek tribes were governed by
chieftains or kings, the private hospitality
existing between the ruling families of two
tribes may have produced similar relations
between their subjects, which, after the abolition
of the kingly power, continued to exist
between the new republics as a kind of political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
inheritance of former times. Or a person
belonging to one state might have either
extensive connections with the citizens of
another state, or entertain great partiality
for the other state itself, and thus offer to
receive all those who came from that state
either on private or public business, and to
act as their patron in his own city. This he
at first did merely as a private individual,
but the state to which he offered this kind
service would naturally soon recognise and
reward him for it. When two states established
public hospitality, and no individuals
came forward to act as the representatives of
their state, it was necessary that in each
state persons should be appointed to show
hospitality to, and watch over the interests
of, all persons who came from the state connected
by hospitality. The persons who were
appointed to this office as the recognised
agents of the state for which they acted were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proxeni</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόξενοι</span>), but those who undertook
it voluntarily <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etheloproxeni</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐθελοπρόξενοι</span>).
The office of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proxenus</i>, which bears
great resemblance to that of a modern consul
or minister-resident, was in some cases hereditary
in a particular family. When a state
appointed a proxenus, it either sent out one
of its own citizens to reside in the other
state, or it selected one of the citizens of this
state, and conferred upon him the honour of
proxenus. The former was, in early times,
the custom of Sparta, where the kings had
the right of selecting from among the Spartan
citizens those whom they wished to send
out as proxeni to other states. But in subsequent
times this custom seems to have been
given up, for we find that at Athens the
family of Callias were the proxeni of Sparta,
and at Argos, the Argive Alciphron. The
principal duties of a proxenus were to receive
those persons, especially ambassadors, who
came from the state which he represented; to
procure for them admission to the assembly,
and seats in the theatre; to act as the patron
of the strangers, and to mediate between the
two states if any disputes arose. If a stranger
died in the state, the proxenus of his country
had to take care of the property of the deceased.&mdash;The
hospitality of the Romans was,
as in Greece, either hospitium privatum or
publicum. Private hospitality with the Romans,
however, seems to have been more
accurately and legally defined than in Greece.
The character of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hospes</i>, <em>i.e.</em> a person connected
with a Roman by ties of hospitality,
was deemed even more sacred, and to have
greater claims upon the host, than that of a
person connected by blood or affinity. The
relation of a hospes to his Roman friend was
next in importance to that of a cliens. The
obligations which the connection of hospitality
with a foreigner imposed upon a Roman,
were to receive in his house his hospes
when travelling; and to protect, and, in case
of need, to represent him as his patron in the
courts of justice. Private hospitality thus
gave to the hospes the claims upon his host
which the client had on his patron, but without
any degree of the dependence implied in
the clientele. Private hospitality was established
between individuals by mutual presents,
or by the mediation of a third person,
and hallowed by religion; for Jupiter hospitalis
was thought to watch over the jus hospitii,
as Zeus xenios did with the Greeks, and
the violation of it was as great a crime and
impiety at Rome as in Greece. When hospitality
was formed, the two friends used to
divide between themselves a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera hospitalis</i>,
by which, afterwards, they themselves
or their descendants&mdash;for the connection was
hereditary as in Greece&mdash;might recognise one
another. Hospitality, when thus once established,
could not be dissolved except by a
formal declaration (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">renuntiatio</i>), and in this
case the tessera hospitalis was broken to
pieces. Public hospitality seems likewise to
have existed at a very early period among
the nations of Italy; but the first direct mention
of public hospitality being established
between Rome and another city, is after the
Gauls had departed from Rome, when it was
decreed that Caere should be rewarded for
its good services by the establishment of
public hospitality between the two cities.
The public hospitality after the war with the
Gauls gave to the Caerites the right of
isopolity with Rome, that is, the civitas
without the suffragium and the honores.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Colonia">Colonia</a>.</span>] In the later times of the republic
we no longer find public hospitality established
between Rome and a foreign state;
but a relation which amounted to the same
thing was introduced in its stead, that is,
towns were raised to the rank of municipia,
and thus obtained the civitas without the
suffragium and the honores; and when a
town was desirous of forming a similar relation
with Rome, it entered into clientela to
some distinguished Roman, who then acted
as patron of the client-town. But the custom
of granting the honour of hospes publicus
to a distinguished foreigner by a decree
of the senate, seems to have existed down to
the end of the republic. His privileges were
the same as those of a municeps, that is, he
had the civitas, but not the suffragium or the
honores. Public hospitality was, like the hospitium
privatum, hereditary in the family of
the person to whom it had been granted.</p>


<p id="Hyacinthia">HỸĂCINTHĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑακίνθια</span>), a great national<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
festival, celebrated every year at Amyclae by
the Amyclaeans and Spartans, probably in
honour of the Amyclaean Apollo and Hyacinthus
together. This Amyclaean Apollo, however,
with whom Hyacinthus was assimilated
in later times, must not be confounded with
Apollo, the national divinity of the Dorians.
The festival was called after the youthful
hero Hyacinthus, who evidently derived his
name from the flower hyacinth (the emblem
of death among the ancient Greeks), and
whom Apollo accidentally struck dead with a
quoit. The Hyacinthia lasted for three days,
and began on the longest day of the Spartan
month Hecatombeus, at the time when the
tender flowers, oppressed by the heat of
the sun, drooped their languid heads. On
the first and last day of the Hyacinthia
sacrifices were offered to the dead, and
the death of Hyacinthus was lamented.
During these two days, nobody wore any
garlands at the repasts, nor took bread, but
only cakes and similar things, and when the
solemn repasts were over, everybody went
home in the greatest quiet and order. The
second day, however, was wholly spent in
public rejoicings and amusements, such as
horse-races, dances, processions, &amp;c. The
great importance attached to this festival by
the Amyclaeans and Lacedaemonians is seen
from the fact, that the Amyclaeans, even
when they had taken the field against an
enemy, always returned home on the approach
of the season of the Hyacinthia, that
they might not be obliged to neglect its celebration;
and that in a treaty with Sparta,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 421, the Athenians, in order to show
their good-will towards Sparta, promised
every year to attend the celebration of this
festival.</p>


<p id="Hybreos">HYBRĔŌS GRĂPHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕβρεως γραφή</span>), an
action prescribed by the Attic law for wanton
and contumelious injury to the person,
whether in the nature of indecent (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δι’ αἰσχρουργίας</span>)
or other assaults (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διὰ πληγῶν</span>). The
severity of the sentence extended to confiscation
or death.</p>


<p id="Hydraulis">HYDRAULIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕδραυλις</span>), an hydraulic organ,
invented by Ctesibius of Alexandria, who
lived about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 200. Its pipes were partly
of bronze, and partly of reed. The number
of its stops, and consequently of its rows of
pipes, varied from one to eight. It continued
in use so late as the ninth century of our
era. The organ was well adapted to gratify
the Roman people in the splendid entertainments
provided for them by the emperors
and other opulent persons. Nero was very
curious about organs, both in regard to their
musical effect and their mechanism. A contorniate
coin of this emperor, in the British
Museum, shows an organ with a sprig of
laurel on one side, and a man standing on
the other.</p>

<p id="Hydriaphoria">HYDRĬAPHŎRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑδριαφορία</span>), was the

service the married alien (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέτοικοι</span>) women
had to perform to the married part of the

to the temple of Athena in the great procession
at the Panathenaea.</p>


<p id="Hyporchema">HỸPORCHĒMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπόρχημα</span>), a lively kind
of mimic dance which accompanied the songs
used in the worship of Apollo, especially
among the Dorians. A chorus of singers at
the festivals of Apollo usually danced around
the altar, while several other persons were
appointed to accompany the action of the
song with an appropriate mimic performance
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπορχεῖσθαι</span>). The hyporchema was thus a
lyric dance, and often passed into the playful
and comic.</p>

<p id="Immunitas">IMMŪNĬTAS (from <em>in</em> and <em>munus</em>), signifies,
(1) A freedom from taxes. (2) A
freedom from services which other citizens
had to discharge. With respect to the first
kind of immunitas we find that the emperors
frequently granted it to separate persons, or
to certain classes of persons, or to whole
states. The second kind of immunitas was
granted to all persons who had a valid excuse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excusatio</i>) to be released from such, services,
and also to other persons as a special favour.
The immunitas might be either general, from
all services which a citizen owed to the state,
or special, such as from military service, from
taking the office of tutor or guardian, and
the like.</p>


<p id="Imperator">IMPĔRĀTOR. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Imperium">Imperium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Imperium">IMPĔRĬUM, was under the republic a
power, without which no military operation
could be carried on as in the name and on
the behalf of the state. It was not incident
to any office, and was always specially conferred
by a lex curiata, that is, a lex passed
in the comitia curiata. Consequently, not
even a consul could act as commander of an
army, unless he were empowered by a lex
curiata. It could not be held or exercised
within the city in the republican period;
but it was sometimes conferred specially upon
an individual for the day of his triumph
within the city, and at least, in some cases,
by a plebiscitum. As opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">potestas,
imperium</i> is the power which was conferred
by the state upon an individual who was
appointed to command an army. The phrases
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consularis potestas</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consulare imperium</i>
might both be properly used; but the expression
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribunitia potestas</i> only could be
used, as the tribuni never received the imperium.
In respect of his imperium, he who
received it was styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperator</i>. After a
victory it was usual for the soldiers to salute
their commander as imperator, but this salutation
neither gave nor confirmed the title,
since the title as a matter of course was
given with the imperium. Under the republic
the title came properly after the name;
thus Cicero, when he was proconsul in Cilicia,
could properly style himself M. Tullius
Cicero Imperator, for the term merely expressed
that he had the imperium. The
emperors Tiberius and Claudius refused to
assume the praenomen of imperator, but the
use of it as a praenomen became established
among their successors. The term imperium
was applied in the republican period to
express the sovereignty of the Roman state.
Thus Gaul is said by Cicero to have come
under the imperium and ditio of the populus
Romanus.</p>


<p id="Impluvium">IMPLŬVĬUM. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Domus">Domus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Impubes">IMPŪBES. An infans was incapable of
doing any legal act. An impubes, who had
passed the limits of infantia, could do any
legal act with the auctoritas of his tutor.
With the attainment of pubertas, a person
obtained the full power over his property,
and the tutela ceased: he could also dispose
of his property by will; and he could contract
marriage. Pubertas, in the case of a
male, was attained with the completion of
the fourteenth, and, in a female, with the
completion of the twelfth year. Upon attaining
the age of puberty a Roman youth
assumed the toga virilis, but until that time
he wore the toga praetexta, the broad purple
hem of which (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetexta</i>) at <ins class="corr" id="tn-211" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'once distinguised'">
once distinguished</ins> him from other persons. The toga virilis
was assumed at the Liberalia in the month
of March, and though no age appears to have
been positively fixed for the ceremony, it
probably took place as a general rule on the
feast which next followed the completion of
the fourteenth year; though it is certain
that the completion of the fourteenth year
was not always the time observed. Still, so
long as a male wore the praetexta, he was
impubes, and when he assumed the toga
virilis, he was pubes.</p>


<p id="Inauguratio">INAUGŬRĀTĬO, was in general the ceremony
by which the augurs obtained, or endeavoured
to obtain, the sanction of the gods
to something which had been decreed by
man; in particular, however, it was the
ceremony by which things or persons were
consecrated to the gods, whence the terms
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dedicatio</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consecratio</i> were sometimes
used as synonymous with inauguratio. Not
only were priests inaugurated, but also the
higher magistrates, who for this purpose were
summoned by the augurs to appear on the
capitol, on the third day after their election.
This inauguratio conferred no priestly dignity
upon the magistrates, but was merely a method
of obtaining the sanction of the gods to
their election, and gave them the right to
take auspicia; and on important emergencies
it was their duty to make use of this privilege.</p>


<p id="Inauris">INAURIS, an ear-ring; called in Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνώτιον</span>, because it was worn in the ear (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὗς</span>),
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλλόβιον</span>, because it was inserted into the
lobe of the ear (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοβός</span>), which was bored for
the purpose. Ear-rings were worn by both
sexes in oriental countries. Among the
Greeks and Romans they were worn only by
females. This ornament consisted of the
ring (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρίκος</span>), and of the drops (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stalagmia</i>).
The ring was generally of gold, although the
common people also wore ear-rings of bronze.
Instead of a ring a hook was often used. The
drops were sometimes of gold, very finely
wrought, and sometimes of pearls.</p>


<p id="Incendium">INCENDĬUM, the crime of setting any
object on fire, by which the property of a
man is endangered. A law of the Twelve
Tables inflicted a severe punishment on the
person who set fire to property maliciously
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sciens</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prudens</i>); but if it was done by accident
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casu</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">id est</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">negligentia</i>), the law
obliged the offender to repair the injury he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
had committed. Sulla, in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Cornelia
de Sicariis</i>, punished malicious (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolo malo</i>)
incendium, but only in the city, or within a
thousand paces of it, with aquae et ignis interdictio.
Cn. Pompeius, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 52, made
incendium a crime of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vis</i> by his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Pompeia
de Vi</i>, in consequence of the burning of the
Curia and the Porcia Basilica on the burial
of Clodius; and Julius Caesar also included
it in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Julia de Vi</i>. Besides the two
criminal prosecutions given by the Lex Cornelia
and Lex Julia, a person could also bring
actions to recover compensation for the injury
done to his property.</p>


<p id="Incestum">INCESTUM or INCESTUS. Incestum is
non castum, and signifies generally all immoral
and irreligious acts. In a narrower
sense it denotes the unchastity of a Vestal,
and sexual intercourse of persons within
certain degrees of consanguinity. Incest
with a Vestal was punished with the death
of both parties. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Vestales">Vestales</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Incunabula">INCŪNĀBŬLA or CŪNABŬLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σπάργανον</span>),
swaddling-clothes, in which a new-born
child was wrapped. It was one of the peculiarities
of the Lacedaemonian education to
dispense with the use of incunabula, and
to allow children to enjoy the free use of
their limbs.</p>

<p id="Infamia">INFĀMĬA, was a consequence of condemnation
for certain crimes, and also a direct
consequence of certain acts, such as adultery,
prostitution, appearing on the public stage as
an actor, &amp;c. A person who became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infamis</i>
lost the suffragium and honores, and
was degraded to the condition of an aerarian.
Infamia should <ins class="corr" id="tn-212" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'be distingushed'">
be distinguished</ins> from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nota

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignominia</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Censor">Censor</a></span>.]</p>


<p id="Infans">INFANS, INFANTIA. In the Roman
law there were several distinctions of age
which were made with reference to the capacity
for doing legal acts:&mdash;1. The first period
was from birth to the end of the seventh
year, during which time persons were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Infantes</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui fari non possunt</i>. 2. The
second period was from the end of seven years
to the end of fourteen or twelve years, according
as the person was a male or a female,
during which persons were defined as those
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui fari possunt</i>. The persons included in
these first two classes were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Impuberes</i>. 3.
The third period was from the end of the
twelfth or fourteenth to the end of the
twenty-fifth year, during which period persons
were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adolescentes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adulti</i>. The persons
included in these three classes were minores
xxv annis or annorum, and were often, for
brevity’s sake, called minores only [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Curator">Curator</a></span>];
and the persons included in the third and
fourth class were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Puberes</i>. 4. The fourth
period was from the age of twenty-five, during
which persons were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Majores</i>.</p>


<p id="Inferiae">INFĔRĬAE. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Infula">INFŬLA, a flock of white and red wool,
which was slightly twisted, drawn into the
form of a wreath or fillet, and used by the
Romans for ornament on festive and solemn
occasions. In sacrificing it was tied with a
white band [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Vitta">Vitta</a></span>] to the head of the victim
and also of the priest.</p>


<p id="Ingenui">INGĔNŬI, were those freemen who were
born free. Consequently, freedmen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libertini</i>)
were not ingenui, though the sons of
libertini were ingenui; nor could a libertinus
by adoption become ingenuus. The words
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingenuus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libertinus</i> are often opposed to
one another; and the title of freeman (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liber</i>),
which would comprehend <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libertinus</i>, is sometimes
limited by the addition of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingenuus</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liber
et ingenuus</i>.) Under the empire a person,
not ingenuus by birth, could be made
ingenuus by the emperor.</p>


<p id="Injuria">INJŪRĬA. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Injuria</i>, in the general sense,
is opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus</i>. In a special sense <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">injuria</i>
was done by striking or beating a man either
with the hand or with anything; by abusive
words (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">convicium</i>); by the proscriptio bonorum,
when the claimant knew that the alleged
debtor was not really indebted to him;
by libellous writings or verses; by soliciting
a materfamilias, &amp;c. The Twelve Tables
had various provisions on the subject of Injuria.
Libellous songs or verses were followed
by capital punishment. In the case of
a limb being mutilated the punishment was
Talio. In the case of a broken bone, the
penalty was 300 asses if the injury was done
to a freeman, and 150 if it was done to a
slave. In other cases the Tables fixed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
penalty at 25 asses. These penalties were
afterwards considered to be insufficient; and
the injured person was allowed by the praetor
to claim such damages as he thought that
he was entitled to, and the judex might give
the full amount or less. Infamia was a consequence
of condemnation in an actio Injuriarum.</p>


<p id="Inoa">ĪNŌA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰνῶα</span>), festivals celebrated in several
parts of Greece, in honour of Ino.</p>

<p id="Instita">INSTĬTA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιπόδιον</span>), a flounce; a fillet.
The Roman matrons sometimes wore a broad
fillet with ample folds, sewed to the bottom
of the tunic and reaching to the instep. The
use of it indicated a superior regard to decency
and propriety of manners.</p>


<p id="Insula">INSŬLA was, properly, a house not joined
to the neighbouring houses by a common
wall. An insula, however, generally contained
several separate houses, or at least
separate apartments or shops, which were let
to different families; and hence the word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">domus</i> under the emperors seems to be applied
to the house where a family lived,
whether it were an insula or not, and insula
to any hired lodgings.</p>


<p id="Intercessio">INTERCESSĬO was the interference of a
magistrates to whom an appeal [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Appellatio">Appellatio</a></span>]
was made. The object of the intercessio was
to put a stop to proceedings, on the ground
of informality or other sufficient cause. Any
magistratus might <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intercedere</i>, who was of
equal rank with or of rank superior to the
magistratus from or against whom the appellatio
was. Cases occur in which one of the
praetors interposed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intercessit</i>) against the
proceedings of his colleague. The intercessio
is most frequently spoken of with reference
to the tribunes, who originally had not jurisdictio,
but used the intercessio for the purpose
of preventing wrong which was offered
to a person in their presence. The intercessio
of the tribunes of the plebs was auxilium,
and it might be exercised either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jure</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in judicio</i>. The tribune <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui intercessit</i> could
prevent a judicium from being instituted.
The tribunes could also use the intercessio to
prevent execution of a judicial sentence. A
single tribune could effect this, and against
the opinion of his colleagues.</p>


<p id="Intercisi">INTERCĪSI DĬES. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Dies">Dies</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Interdictum">INTERDICTUM. “In certain cases (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">certis
ex causis</i>) the praetor or proconsul, in the
first instance (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">principaliter</i>), exercises his
authority for the termination of disputes.
This he chiefly does when the dispute is
about possession or quasi-possession; and the
exercise of his authority consists in ordering
something to be done, or forbidding something
to be done. The formulae and the
terms, which he uses on such occasions, are
called either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interdicta</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decreta</i>. They are
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decreta</i> when he orders something to
be done, as when he orders something to be
produced (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exhiberi</i>) or to be restored: they
are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interdicta</i> when he forbids something
to be done, as when he orders that
force shall not be used against a person who
is in possession rightfully (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine vitio</i>), or that
nothing shall be done on a piece of sacred
ground. Accordingly all interdicta are
either restitutoria, or exhibitoria, or prohibitoria.”
This passage, which is taken from
Gaius, the Roman jurist, contains the essential
distinction between an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actio</i> and an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">interdictum</i>.
In the case of an actio, the praetor
pronounces no order or decree, but he gives
a judex, whose business it is to investigate
the matter in dispute, and to pronounce
a sentence consistently with the formula,
which is his authority for acting. In the
case of an actio, therefore, the praetor neither
orders nor forbids a thing to be done, but he
says, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicium dabo</i>. In the case of an interdict,
the praetor makes an order that something
shall be done or shall not be done, and
his words are accordingly words of command;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Restituas, Exhibeas, Vim fieri veto</i>. This <em>immediate</em>
interposition of the praetor is appropriately
expressed by the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">principaliter</i>.</p>


<p id="Interpres">INTERPRES, an interpreter. This class
of persons became very numerous and necessary
to the Romans as their empire extended.
In large mercantile towns the interpreters,
who formed a kind of agents through whom
business was done, were sometimes very
numerous. All Roman praetors, proconsuls,
and quaestors, who were entrusted with the
administration of a province, had to carry on
all their official proceedings in the Latin language,
and as they could not be expected to
be acquainted with the language of the provincials,
they had always among their servants
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Apparitor">Apparitores</a></span>] one or more interpreters,
who were generally Romans, but in most
cases undoubtedly freedmen. These interpreters
had not only to officiate at the conventus
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Conventus">Conventus</a></span>], but also explained to the Roman
governor everything which the provincials
might wish to be laid before him.</p>


<p id="Interregnum">INTERREGNUM. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Interrex">Interrex</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Interrex">INTERREX. This office is said to have
been instituted on the death of Romulus,
when the senate wished to share the sovereign
power among themselves, instead of electing
a king. For this purpose, according to Livy,
the senate, which then consisted of one hundred
members, was divided into ten decuries;
and from each of these decuries one senator
was nominated. These together formed a
board of ten, with the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Interreges</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
each of whom enjoyed in succession the regal
power and its badges for five days; and if no
king was appointed at the expiration of fifty
days, the rotation began anew. The period
during which they exercised their power was
called an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Interregnum</i>. These ten interreges
were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decem Primi</i>, or ten leading senators,
of whom the first was chief of the whole
senate. The interreges agreed among themselves
who should be proposed as king, and
if the senate approved of their choice, they
summoned the assembly of the curiae, and
proposed the person whom they had previously
agreed upon; the power of the curiae
was confined to accepting or rejecting him.
Interreges were appointed under the republic
for holding the comitia for the election of the
consuls, when the consuls, through civil commotions
or other causes, had been unable to
do so in their year of office. Each held the
office for only five days, as under the kings.
The comitia were hardly ever held by the
first interrex; more usually by the second or
third; but in one instance we read of an
eleventh, and in another of a fourteenth interrex.
The interreges under the republic,
at least from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 482, were elected by the
senate from the whole body, and were not
confined to the decem primi or ten chief senators,
as under the kings. Plebeians, however,
were not admissible to this office; and
consequently, when plebeians were admitted
into the senate, the patrician senators met
without the plebeian members to elect an interrex.
For this reason, as well as on account
of the influence which the interrex
exerted in the election of the magistrates, we
find that the tribunes of the plebs were
strongly opposed to the appointment of an
interrex. The interrex had jurisdictio. Interreges
continued to be appointed occasionally
till the time of the second Punic war,
but after that time we read of no interrex,
till the senate, by command of Sulla, created
an interrex to hold the comitia for his election
as dictator, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 82. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 55 another
interrex was appointed, to hold the
comitia in which Pompey and Crassus were
elected consuls; and we also read of interreges
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 53 and 52, in the latter of
which years an interrex held the comitia in
which Pompey was appointed sole consul.</p>


<p id="Isthmia">ISTHMĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴσθμια</span>), the Isthmian games,
one of the four great national festivals of the
Greeks. This festival derived its name from
the Corinthian isthmus, where it was held.
Subsequent to the age of Theseus the Isthmia
were celebrated in honour of Poseidon; and
this innovation is ascribed to Theseus himself.
The celebration of the Isthmia was
conducted by the Corinthians, but Theseus
had reserved for his Athenians some honourable
distinctions: those Athenians who attended
the Isthmia sailed across the Saronic
gulf in a sacred vessel (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωρίς</span>), and an honorary
place (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προεδρία</span>), as large as the sail
of their vessel, was assigned to them during
the celebration of the games. In times of
war between the two states a sacred truce
was concluded, and the Athenians were invited
to attend at the solemnities. These
games were celebrated regularly every other
year, in the first and third years of each
Olympiad. After the fall of Corinth, in 146
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the Sicyonians were honoured with the
privilege of conducting the Isthmian games;
but when the town of Corinth was rebuilt by
Julius Caesar, the right of conducting the solemnities
was restored to the Corinthians. The
season of the Isthmian solemnities was, like
that of all the great national festivals, distinguished
by general rejoicings and feasting.
The contests and games of the Isthmia were
the same as those at Olympia, and embraced
all the varieties of athletic performances,
such as wrestling, the pancratium, together
with horse and chariot racing. Musical and
poetical contests were likewise carried on,
and in the latter women were also allowed
to take part. The prize of a victor in the
Isthmian games consisted at first of a garland
of pine-leaves, and afterwards of a wreath of
ivy. Simple as such a reward was, a victor
in these games gained the greatest distinction
and honour among his countrymen; and
a victory not only rendered the individual
who obtained it a subject of admiration, but
shed lustre over his family, and the whole
town or community to which he belonged.
Hence Solon established by a law, that every
Athenian who gained the victory at the
Isthmian games should receive from the
public treasury a reward of one hundred
drachmae. His victory was generally celebrated
in lofty odes, called Epinikia, or triumphal
odes, of which we still possess some
beautiful specimens among the poems of
Pindar.</p>

<p id="Janua">JĀNŬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύρα</span>), a door. Besides being
applicable to the doors of apartments in the
interior of a house, which were properly
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostia</i>, this term more especially denoted
the first entrance into the house, <em>i.e.</em> the
front or street door, which was also called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anticum</i>, and in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύρα αὔλειος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλεία</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὔλιος</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλία</span>. The houses of the Romans
commonly had a back door, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posticum</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">postica</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">posticula</i>, and in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παράθυρα</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
<em>dim.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραθύριον</span>. The door-way, when complete,
consisted of four indispensable parts;
the threshold, or sill (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">limen</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βηλός</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὖδας</span>);
the lintel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jugumentum, limen superum</i>);
and the two jambs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">postes</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σταθμοί</span>). The
door itself was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foris</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">valva</i>, and in
Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σανίς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλισιάς</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύρετρον</span>. These
words are commonly found in the plural,
because the door-way of every building of
the least importance contained two doors
folding together. When <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foris</i> is used in the
singular, it denotes one of the folding doors
only. The fastenings of the door (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">claustra</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obices</i>) commonly consisted of a bolt (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pessulus</i>;
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάνδαλος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατοχεύς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλεῖθρον</span>) placed at
the base of each <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foris</i>, so as to admit of being
pushed into a socket made in the sill to
receive it. By night, the front-door of the
house was further secured by means of a
wooden and sometimes an iron bar (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sera</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repagula</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοχλός</span>) placed across it, and inserted
into sockets on each side of the door-way.
Hence it was necessary to remove the
bar (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸν <ins class="corr" id="tn-215" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'μοχλόν'">
μοχλὸν</ins> παράφερειν</span>) in order to open
the door (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reserare</i>). It was considered improper
to enter a house without giving notice
to its inmates. This notice the Spartans gave
by shouting; the Athenians and all other
nations by using the knocker, or more commonly
by rapping with the knuckles or with
a stick (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κρούειν</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόπτειν</span>). In the houses of
the rich a porter (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">janitor</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">custos</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυρωρός</span>)
was always in attendance to open the door.
He was commonly an eunuch or a slave, and
was chained to his post. To assist him in
guarding the entrance, a dog was universally
kept near it, being also attached by a chain
to the wall; and in reference to this practice,
the warning <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cave canem</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐλαβοῦ τὴν
κύνα</span>, was sometimes written near the door.
The appropriate name for the portion of the
house immediately behind the door (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυρών</span>)
denotes that it was a kind of apartment; it
corresponded to the hall or lobby of our
houses. Immediately adjoining it, and close
to the front door, there was in many houses
a small room for the porter.</p>


<p id="Jentaculum">JENTĀCŬLUM. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Coena">Coena</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Judex">JŪDEX, JŪDĬCĬUM. A Roman magistratus
generally did not investigate the facts
in dispute in such matters as were brought
before him: he appointed a judex for that
purpose, and gave him instructions. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Actio">Actio</a>.</span>]
Accordingly, the whole of civil procedure was
expressed by the two phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judicium</i>,
of which the former comprehended all
that took place before the magistratus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
jure</i>), and the latter all that took place before
the judex (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in judicio</i>). In many cases a
single judex was appointed: in others, several
were appointed, and they seem to have been
sometimes called recuperatores, as opposed to
the single judex. Under certain circumstances
the judex was called arbiter: thus
judex and arbiter are named together in the
Twelve Tables. A judex when appointed
was bound to discharge the functions of the
office, unless he had some valid excuse
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excusatio</i>). There were certain seasons of
the year when legal business was done at
Rome, and at these times the services of the
judices were required. These legal terms
were regulated according to the seasons, so
that there were periods of vacation. When
the judex was appointed, the proceedings <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
jure</i> or before the praetor were terminated.
The parties appeared before the judex on the
third day (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comperendinatio</i>), unless the praetor
had deferred the judicium for some sufficient
reason. The judex was generally aided
by advisers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jurisconsulti</i>) learned in the law,
who were said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in consilio adesse</i>; but the
judex alone was empowered to give judgment.
The matter was first briefly stated
to the judex (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">causae conjectio, collectio</i>), and
the advocates of each party supported his
cause in a speech. Witnesses were produced
on both sides, and examined orally: the
witnesses on one side were also cross-examined
by the other. After all the evidence was
given and the advocates had finished, the
judex gave sentence: if there were several
judices, a majority decided. If the matter
was one of difficulty, the hearing might be
adjourned as often as was necessary (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampliatio</i>);
and if the judex could not come to
a satisfactory conclusion, he might declare
this upon oath, and so release himself from
the difficulty. This was done by the form
of words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non liquere</i> (N. L.). The sentence
was pronounced orally, and was sometimes
first written on a tablet. If the defendant
did not make his appearance after being duly
summoned, judgment might be given against
him.&mdash;According to Cicero, all judicia had
for their object, either the settlement of disputes
between individuals (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">controversiae</i>), or
the punishment of crimes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maleficia</i>). This
refers to a division of judicia, which appears
in the jurists, into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicia publica</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicia
privata</i>. The former, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicia publica</i>,
succeeded to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicia populi</i> of the early
republican period: the latter were so called
because in them the populus acted as judices.
Originally the kings presided in all criminal
cases, and the consuls succeeded to their
authority. But after the passing of the <a href="#Valeriae">Lex
Valeria</a> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 507), which gave an appeal to
the populus (that is, the comitia curiata)
from the magistratus, the consul could not
sit in judgment on the caput of a Roman
citizen, but such cases were tried in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
comitia, or persons were appointed to preside
at such inquiries, who were accordingly
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaesitores</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaestores parricidii</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rerum capitalium</i>. In course of time, as such
cases became of more frequent occurrence,
such quaestiones were made perpetual, that
is, particular magistrates were appointed for
the purpose. It was eventually determined,
that while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetor urbanus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peregrinus</i>
should continue to exercise their usual jurisdictions,
the other praetors should preside at
public trials. In such trials any person
might be an accuser (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accusator</i>). The praetor
generally presided as quaesitor, assisted by a
judex quaestionis, and a body of judices called
his consilium. The judices were generally
chosen by lot out of those who were qualified
to act; but in some cases the accuser and
the accused (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reus</i>) had the privilege of choosing
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edere</i>) a certain number of judices out
of a large number, who were thence called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Edititii</i>. Both the accusator and the reus
had the privilege of rejecting or challenging
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rejicere</i>) such judices as they did not like.
In many cases a lex was passed for the purpose
of regulating the mode of procedure.&mdash;The
judices voted by ballot, at least generally,
and a majority determined the acquittal or
condemnation of the accused. Each judex
was provided with three tablets (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae</i>), on
one of which was marked A, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Absolvo</i>; on a
second C, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Condemno</i>; and on a third N. L.,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non liquet</i>. The judices voted by placing
one of these tablets in the urns, which were
then examined for the purpose of ascertaining
the votes. It was the duty of the magistratus
to pronounce the sentence of the
judices; in the case of condemnation, to
adjudge the legal penalty; of acquittal, to
declare the accused acquitted; and of doubt,
to declare that the matter must be further investigated
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amplius cognoscendum</i>).&mdash;A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicium
populi</i>, properly so called, was one in
which the case was tried in the comitia curiata,
but afterwards in the comitia centuriata
and tributa. The accuser, who must be a
magistratus, commenced by declaring in a
contio that he would on a certain day accuse
a certain person, whom he named, of some
offence, which he also specified. This was
expressed by the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diem dicere</i>. If the
offender held any high office, it was necessary
to wait till his time of service had
expired, before proceedings could be thus
commenced against him. The accused was
required to give security for his appearance
on the day of trial; the security was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vades</i> in a causa capitalis, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praedes</i> when
the penalty for the alleged offence was pecuniary.
If such security was not given,
the accused was kept in confinement. If
nothing prevented the inquiry from taking
place at the time fixed for it, the trial proceeded,
and the accuser had to prove his case
by evidence. The investigation of the facts
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anquisitio</i> with reference to the
proposed penalty: accordingly, the phrases
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecunia, capite</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capitis anquirere</i>, are used.
When the investigation was concluded, the
magistratus promulgated a rogatio, which
comprehended the charge and the punishment
or fine. It was a rule of law that a
fine should not be imposed together with
another punishment in the same rogatio.
The rogatio was made public during three
nundinae, like any other lex, and proposed
at the comitia for adoption or rejection. The
accused sometimes withdrew into exile before
the votes were taken; or he might make his
defence. The offences which were the chief
subject of judicia populi and publica were
majestas, adulteria and stupra, parricidium,
falsum, vis publica and privata, peculatus,
repetundae, ambitus.&mdash;With the passing of
special enactments for the punishment of
particular offences, was introduced the practice
of forming a body of judices for the trial
of such offences as the enactments were
directed against. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Album Judicum</i> was
the body out of which judices were to be
chosen. It is not known what was the number
of the body so constituted, but it has
been conjectured that the number was 350,
and that ten were chosen from each tribe,
and thus the origin of the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decuriae
Judicum</i> is explained. It is easy to conceive
that the judicia populi, properly so called,
would be less frequent, as special leges were
framed for particular offences, the circumstances
of which could be better investigated
by a smaller body of judices than by the
assembled people. The <a href="#Servilia_j">Lex Servilia</a> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
104) enacted that the judices should not be
under thirty nor above sixty years of age,
that the accuser and accused should severally
propose one hundred judices, and that each
might reject fifty from the list of the other,
so that one hundred would remain for the
trial. Up to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 122 the judices were always
senators, but in this year the <a href="#Semproniae">Sempronia Lex</a>
of C. Gracchus took the judicia from the
senators and gave them to the equites. This
state of things lasted nearly fifty years, till
Sulla (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 80) restored the judicia to the
senate, and excluded the equites from the
album judicum. A <a href="#Aurelia">Lex Aurelia</a> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 70)
enacted that the judices should be chosen
from the three classes&mdash;of senators, equites,
and tribuni aerarii; and accordingly the judicia
were then said to be divided between
the senate and the equites. The tribuni
aerarii were taken from the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
citizens, and were, or ought to have been,
persons of some property. Thus the three
decuriae of judices were formed; and it was
either in consequence of the <a href="#Aurelia">Lex Aurelia</a> or
the <a href="#Fufia">Lex Fufia</a> that, instead of one urn for
all the tablets, the decuriae had severally
their balloting urn, so that the votes of the
three classes were known. It is not known
if the <a href="#Aurelia">Lex Aurelia</a> determined the number of
judices in any given case. The <a href="#Pompeiae">Lex Pompeia</a>
de Vi and De Ambitu (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 52) determined
that eighty judices were to be selected
by lot, out of whom the accuser and the
accused might reject thirty. In the case of
Clodius, in the matter of the Bona Dea, there
were fifty-six judices. It is conjectured that
the number fixed for a given case, by the
<a href="#Aurelia">Lex Aurelia</a>, was seventy judices. Augustus
added to the existing three decuriae judicum
a fourth decuria, called that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ducenarii</i>,
who had a lower pecuniary qualification, and
only decided in smaller matters. Caligula
added a fifth decuria, in order to diminish
the labours of the judices.</p>


<p id="Jugerum">JŪGĔRUM, a Roman measure of surface,
240 feet in length and 120 in breadth, containing
therefore 28,800 square feet. It was
the double of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actus Quadratus</i>, and from
this circumstance, according to some writers,
it derived its name. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Actus">Actus</a>.</span>] The uncial
division [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As_c">As</a></span>] was applied to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jugerum</i>, its
smallest part being the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scrupulum</i> of 10 feet
square, = 100 square feet. Thus the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jugerum</i>
contained 288 scrupula. The jugerum was
the common measure of land among the Romans.
Two <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jugera</i> formed an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heredium</i>, a
hundred <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heredia</i> a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centuria</i>, and four <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centuriae</i>
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saltus</i>. These divisions were derived
from the original assignment of landed property,
in which two <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jugera</i> were given to
each citizen as heritable property.</p>


<p id="Jugum">JŬGUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζυγός, ζυγόν</span>), signified in general
that which joined two things together, such
as the transverse beam which united the upright
posts of a loom, the cross-bar of a lyre,
a scale-beam, &amp;c., but it denoted more especially
the yoke by which ploughs and carriages
were drawn. The following woodcut
shows two examples of the yoke: the upper
one is provided with two collars, the lower
one with excavations cut in the yoke, in
order to give more ease and freedom to the
animals. The latter figure shows the method
of tying the yoke to the pole (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">temo</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥυμός</span>) by
means of a leathern strap. The word jugum
is often used to signify <em>slavery</em>, or the condition
in which men are compelled, against
their will, like oxen or horses, to labour for
others. Hence, to express symbolically the
subjugation of conquered nations, the Romans
made their captives pass under a yoke
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub jugum mittere</i>), which, however, was
not made like the yoke used in drawing carriages
or ploughs, but consisted of a spear
supported transversely by two others placed
upright.</p>

<p id="Jurisconsulti">JŪRISCONSULTI or JŪRĔCONSULTI
arose among the Romans after the separation
of the Jus Civile from the Jus Pontificium.
Such a body certainly existed before the time
of Cicero, and the persons who professed to
expound the law were called by the various
names of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jurisperiti</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jurisconsulti</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consulti</i>
simply. They were also designated by other
names, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jurisprudentes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prudentiores</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peritiores</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">juris auctores</i>. The business of
the early jurisconsulti consisted both in advising
and acting on behalf of their clients
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">consultores</i>) gratuitously. They gave their
advice or answers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">responsa</i>) either in public
places which they attended at certain times,
or at their own houses; and not only on
matters of law, but on any thing else that
might be referred to them. The words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scribere</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavere</i> referred to their employment
in drawing up formal instruments, such as
contracts or wills, &amp;c. At a later period,
many of these functions were performed by
persons who were paid by a fee, and thus
there arose a body of practitioners distinct
from those who gave responsa and who were
writers and teachers. Tiberius Coruncanius,
a plebeian, who was consul <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 281, and
also the first plebeian Pontifex Maximus, is
mentioned as the first who publicly professed
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">publice professus est</i>), and he was distinguished
both for his knowledge of the law

<p id="Jurisdictio">JŪRISDICTIO, signifies generally the authority
of the magistrate “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui jus dicit</span>,” and
is mostly applied to the authority of the
praetor in civil cases, such as the giving of
the formula in an actio and the appointment
of a judex. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Actio">Actio</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Jus">JŪS. The law peculiar to the Roman
state is sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Civile Romanorum</i>,
but more frequently <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Civile</i> only.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Quiritium</i> is equivalent to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus
Civile Romanorum</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus civil</i>e of the Romans
is divisible into two parts, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus civile</i> in
the narrower sense, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus pontificium</i>, or
the law of religion. This opposition is sometimes
expressed by the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fas</i>.
The law of religion, or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Pontificium</i>,
was under the control of the pontifices, who
in fact originally had the control of the
whole mass of the law; and it was only after
the separation of the jus civile in its wider
sense into the two parts of the jus civile, in
its narrower sense, and the jus pontificium,
that each part had its proper and peculiar
limits. Still, even after the separation, there
was a mutual relation between these two
branches of law; for instance, an adrogatio
was not valid by the jus civile unless it was
valid by the jus pontificium. Again, jus
pontificium, in its wider sense, as the law of
religion, had its subdivisions, as into jus augurum,
pontificium, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="Jusjurandum">JUSJŪRANDUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅρκος</span>), an oath. (1)
<span class="smcap">Greek.</span> An oath is an appeal to some superior
being, calling on him to bear witness
that the swearer speaks the truth, or intends
to perform the promise which he makes. We
find early mention in the Greek writers of oaths
being taken on solemn and important occasions,
as treaties, alliances, vows, compacts,
and agreements, both between nations and individuals.
The Greeks paid high regard to the
sanctity of oaths. The poets frequently allude
to the punishment of perjury after death,
which they assign to the infernal gods or
furies, and we find many proofs of a persuasion
that perjurers would not prosper in this
world. Anciently the person who took an
oath stood up, and lifted his hands to heaven,
as he would in prayer; for an oath was a
species of prayer, and required the same sort
of ceremony. Oaths were frequently accompanied
with sacrifice or libation. The parties
used also to lay their hands upon the victims,
or on the altar or some other sacred thing,
as if by so doing they brought before them
the deity by whom the oath was sworn, and
made him witness of the ceremony. Hence
the expressions <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρὸς τὸν βωμὸν ἐξορκίζειν</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀμνύναι
καθ’ ἱερῶν</span>. The hand especially was regarded
as a pledge of fidelity, and the allusions
to the junction of hands in making contracts
and agreements abound in the ancient
writers. The different nations of Greece
swore by their own peculiar gods and heroes;
as the Thebans by Hercules, Iolaus, &amp;c., the
Lacedaemonians by Castor and Pollux, the
Corinthians by Poseidon; the Athenians swore
principally by Zeus, Athena, Apollo (their
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πατρῷος θεὸς</span>), Demeter, and Dionysus. The
office or character of the party, or the place,
or the occasion often suggested the oath to be
taken. As swearing became a common practice
with men upon trivial occasions, and in
ordinary conversation, they used to take
oaths by any god, person, or thing, as their
peculiar habits or predilections, or the fancy
of the moment, dictated. Women also had
their favourite oaths. As the men preferred
swearing by Hercules, Apollo, &amp;c., so the
other sex used to swear by Aphrodite, Demeter,
and Persephone, Hera, Hecate, Artemis;
and Athenian women by Aglauros,
Pandrosus, &amp;c.&mdash;(2) <span id="Jusj_r" class="smcap">Roman.</span> I. <em>Oaths taken
by magistrates and other persons who entered
the service of the republic.</em>&mdash;After the establishment
of the republic the consuls, and
subsequently all the other magistrates, were
obliged, within five days after their appointment,
to promise on oath that they would
protect and observe the laws of the republic
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in leges jurare</i>). Vestal virgins and the
flamen dialis were not allowed to swear on
any occasion. During the later period of
the republic we also find that magistrates,
when the time of their office had expired,
addressed the people and swore that during
their office they had undertaken nothing
against the republic, but had done their utmost
to promote its welfare. All Roman
soldiers after they were enlisted for a campaign,
had to take the military oath (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacramentum</i>).
It may here be remarked that any
oath might be taken in two ways: the person
who took it, either framed it himself, or it
was put to him in a set form, and in this case
he was said in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verba jurare</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jurare verbis
conceptis</i>.&mdash;II. <em>Oaths taken in transactions
with foreign nations in the name of the republic.</em>
According to the most ancient form
the pater patratus pronounced the oath in
the name of his country, and struck the
victim with a flint-stone, calling on Jupiter
to destroy the Roman nation in like manner,
as he (the pater patratus) destroyed the animal,
if the people should violate the oath.
The chiefs or priests of the other nation then
swore in a similar manner by their own
gods. In swearing to a treaty with a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
nation, a victim (a pig or a lamb) was in the
early times always sacrificed by the fetialis
(whence the expressions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foedus icere</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅρκια
τέμνειν</span>), and the priest while pronouncing
the oath probably touched the victim or the
altar. The jus fetiale, however, fell into disuse
as the Romans extended their conquests;
and as in most cases of treaties with foreign
nations, the Romans were not the party that
chose to promise anything on oath, we hear
no more of oaths on their part. At first the
Romans were very scrupulous in observing
their oaths in contracts or treaties with foreigners,
and even with enemies; but from
the third Punic war to the end of the republic,
perjury was common among the Romans
in their dealings with foreigners as
well as among themselves.&mdash;III. <em>Oaths or
various modes of swearing in common life.</em>
The practice of swearing in ordinary conversations,
was as common among the Romans
as among the Greeks. The forms used were
sometimes simple invocations of one or more
gods, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hercle</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mehercle</i>, that is, ita me
Hercules juvet, amet, or servet; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pol</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perpol</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aedepol</i>, that is, per Pollucem; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per Jovem
Lapidem</i> or simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per Jovem</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per superos</i>;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per deos immortales</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">medius fidius</i>, that is,
ita me Dius (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δίος</span>) filius juvet; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ita me deus
amet</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dii ament</i>. Women as well as men
swore by most of the gods; but some oaths
were peculiar to one of the sexes. Thus women
never swore by Hercules, and men never
by Castor. Sometimes oaths were accompanied
with an execration, in case the swearer
was stating a falsehood: as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dii me perdant</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dii
me interficiant</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dispeream</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne vivam</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne salvus
sim</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;IV. <em>Oaths taken before the praetor
or in courts of justice.</em> There might be a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jusjurandum</i> either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in jure</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in judicio</i>. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jusjurandum in jure</i> is the oath which one
party proposed to his adversary (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">detulit</i>) that
he should make about the matter in dispute;
and the effect of the oath being taken or refused
was equivalent to a judicium. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jusjurandum in judicio (jusjurandum judiciale)</i>
was required by the judex, and not by
either of the parties, though either of the
parties might suggest it.</p>


<p id="Justitium">JUSTĬTĬUM, a cessation of public business
of every kind. Thus the courts of law and
the treasury were shut up, no ambassadors
were received in the senate, and no auctions
took place. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Justitium</i> was proclaimed
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edicere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">indicere</i>) by the senate and the magistrates
in times of public alarm and danger;
and after confidence and tranquillity had
been restored, the Justitium was removed
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">remittere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exuere</i>) by the same authorities.
As such times of alarm are usually accompanied
with general sorrow, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Justitium</i> came
in course of time to be ordained as a mark of
public mourning, and under the empire was
only employed for this reason.</p>


<p id="Juvenalia">JŬVĔNĀLĬA, or JŬVĔNĀLES LŪDI,
scenic games instituted by Nero, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 59,
in commemoration of his shaving his beard
for the first time, thus intimating that he
had passed from youth to manhood. He was
then in the twenty-second year of his age.
These games were not celebrated in the circus,
but in a private theatre erected in a pleasure-ground
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemus</i>), and consisted of every kind
of theatrical performance, Greek and Roman
plays, mimetic pieces, and the like. The Juvenalia
continued to be celebrated by subsequent
emperors, but not on the same occasion.
The name was given to those games
which were exhibited by the emperors on the
1st of January in each year. They no longer
consisted of scenic representations, but of
chariot races and combats of wild beasts.</p>

<p id="Labyrinthus">LĂBỸRINTHUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαβύρινθος</span>), a labyrinth,
a large and complicated subterraneous cavern
with numerous and intricate passages, similar
to those of a mine. The earliest and most
renowned labyrinth was that of Egypt, which
lay beyond lake Moeris. It had 3000 apartments,
1500 under ground, and the same
number above it, and the whole was surrounded
by a wall. It was divided into courts,
each of which was surrounded by colonnades
of white marble. The second labyrinth mentioned
by the ancients was that of Crete, in
the neighbourhood of Cnossus, where the Minotaur
is said to have dwelt. Although the
Cretan labyrinth is very frequently mentioned
by ancient authors, yet none of them
speaks of it as an eyewitness. It was probably
some natural cavern in the neighbourhood
of Cnossus. A third labyrinth, the construction
of which belongs to a more historical
age, was that in the island of Lemnos. A
fabulous edifice in Etruria is also mentioned,
to which Pliny applies the name of labyrinth.
It is described as being in the neighbourhood
of Clusium, and as the tomb of Lar Porsena;
but no writer says that he ever saw it, or remains
of it.</p>


<p id="Lacerna">LĂCERNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μανδύας</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μανδύη</span>), a cloak worn
by the Romans over the toga. It differed
from the paenula in being an open garment
like the Greek pallium, and fastened on
the right shoulder by means of a buckle
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fibula</i>), whereas the paenula was what is
called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestimentum clausum</i> with an opening
for the head. The Lacerna appears to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
have been commonly used in the army. In
the time of Cicero it was not usually worn in
the city, but it soon afterwards became quite
common at Rome. The lacerna was sometimes
thrown over the head for the purpose
of concealment; but a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cucullus</i> or cowl was
generally used for that purpose, which appears
to have been frequently attached to the
lacerna, and to have formed a part of the
dress.</p>


<p id="Laciniae">LĂCĬNĬAE, the angular extremities of the
toga, one of which was brought round over
the left shoulder. It was generally tucked
into the girdle, but sometimes was allowed to
hang down loose.</p>

<p id="Laena">LAENA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χλαῖνα</span>), a woollen cloak, the
cloth of which was twice the ordinary thickness,
shaggy upon both sides, and worn
over the pallium or the toga for the sake of
warmth. In later times the laena seems, to
a certain extent, to have been worn as a substitute
for the toga.</p>


<p id="Lampadephoria">LAMPĂDĒPHŎRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαμπαδηφορία</span>), <em>torch-bearing</em>,
<span class="smcap">Lampadedromia</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαμπαδηδρομία</span>),
<em>torch-race</em>, and often simply <span class="smcap">Lampas</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαμπάς</span>),
was a game common throughout Greece.
At Athens we know of five celebrations of
this game: one to Prometheus at the Prometheia,
a second to Athena at the Panathenaca,
a third to Hephaestos at the Hephaesteia, a
fourth to Pan, and a fifth to the Thracian
Artemis or Bendis. The first three are of
unknown antiquity; the fourth was introduced
soon after the battle of Marathon; the
last in the time of Socrates. The race was
usually run on foot, horses being first used in
the time of Socrates; sometimes also at night.
The preparation for it was a principal branch
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gymnasiarchia</i>, so much so indeed in
later times, that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lampadarchia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαμπαδαρχία</span>)
seems to have been pretty much equivalent
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gymnasiarchia</i>. The gymnasiarch
had to provide the lampas, which was
a candlestick with a kind of shield set at the
bottom of the socket, so as to shelter the
flame of the candle; as is seen in the following
woodcut, taken from a coin. He had
also to provide for the training of the runners,
which was of no slight consequence, for
the race was evidently a severe one, with
other expenses, which on the whole were
very heavy, so that Isaeus classes this office
with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">choregia</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trierarchia</i>, and reckons
that it had cost him 12 minae.</p>

<p id="Laqueus">LĂQUĔUS, a rope, was used to signify the
punishment of death by strangling. This
mode of execution was never performed in
public, but only in prison and generally in
the Tullianum. Hence we find the words
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carcer</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laqueus</i> frequently joined together.

crudi</i>), and those which were burnt in the
kiln (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cocti</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coctiles</i>). They preferred for

<p id="Latinitas">LĂTĪNĬTAS, LĂTĬUM, JUS LĂTĬI. All
these expressions are used to signify a certain
status intermediate between that of cives and
peregrini. Before the passing of the Lex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Julia de Civitate (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 90) the above expressions
denoted a certain nationality, and as
part of it a certain legal status with reference
to Rome; but after the passing of that
lex, these expressions denoted only a certain
status, and had no reference to any national
distinction. About the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 89, a Lex
Pompeia gave the jus Latii to all the Transpadani,
and consequently the privilege of obtaining
the Roman civitas by having filled a
magistratus in their own cities. To denote
the status of these Transpadani, the word
Latinitas was used, which since the passing
of the Lex Julia had lost its proper signification;
and this was the origin of that Latinitas
which thenceforth existed to the time of Justinian.
This new Latinitas or jus Latii was
given to whole towns and countries; as,
for instance, by Vespasian to the whole of
Spain. It is not certain wherein this new
Latinitas differed from that Latinitas which
was the characteristic of the Latini before
the passing of the Lex Julia. It is, however,
clear that all the old Latini had not the
same right with respect to Rome; and that
they could acquire the civitas on easier terms
than those by which the new Latinitas was
acquired.</p>


<p id="Latrunculi">LĂTRUNCŬLI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεσσοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψήφοι</span>), draughts.
The invention of a game resembling draughts
was attributed by the Greeks to Palamedes;
and it is mentioned by Homer. There were
two sets of men, one set being black, the
other white or red. Being intended to represent
a miniature combat between two
armies, they were called soldiers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">milites</i>),
foes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hostes</i>), and marauders (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">latrones</i>, dim.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">latrunculi</i>); also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calculi</i>, because stones were
often employed for the purpose. The Romans
often had twelve lines on the draught-board,
whence the game so played was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duodecim scripta</i>.</p>

Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lapicidinae</i>), literally places where
stones are cut, or quarries, and more particularly
the public prison of Syracuse. It lay
in the steep and almost inaccessible part of
the town which was called Epipolae, and had
been built by Dionysius the tyrant. It was
cut to an immense depth into the solid rock,
so that nothing could be imagined to be a
safer or stronger prison, though it had no
roof, and thus left the prisoners exposed to
the heat of the sun, the rain, and the coldness
of the nights. The Tullianum at Rome
was also sometimes called lautumiae. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Carcer">Carcer</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Lectica">LECTICA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλίνη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλινίδιον</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φορεῖον</span>), was
a kind of couch or litter, in which persons, in
a lying position, were carried from one place
to another. Lecticae were used for carrying
the dead [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a></span>] as well as the living.
The Greek lectica consisted of a bed or mattress,
and a pillow to support the head, placed
upon a kind of bedstead or couch. It had a
roof, consisting of the skin of an ox, extending
over the couch and resting on four posts.
The sides of this lectica were covered with
curtains. In the republican period it appears
to have been chiefly used by women, and by
men only when they were in ill health. When
this kind of lectica was introduced among the
Romans, it was chiefly used in travelling,
and very seldom in Rome itself. But towards
the end of the republic, and under the empire,
it was commonly used in the city, and
was fitted up in the most splendid manner.
Instead of curtains, it was frequently closed
on the sides with windows made of transparent
stone (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapis specularis</i>), and was provided
with a pillow and bed. When standing, it
rested on four feet, generally made of wood.
Persons were carried in a lectica by slaves
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lecticarii</i>), by means of poles (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">asseres</i>) attached
to it, but not fixed, so that they might
easily be taken off when necessary. The
number of lecticarii employed in carrying one
lectica varied according to its size, and the
display of wealth which a person might wish
to make. The ordinary number was probably
two; but it varied from two to eight, and the
lectica is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hexaphoron</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">octophoron</i>,
accordingly as it was carried by six or eight
persons.</p>


<p id="Lectisternium">LECTISTERNIUM. Sacrifices being of the
nature of feasts, the Greeks and Romans, on
occasion of extraordinary solemnities, placed
images of the gods reclining on couches, with
tables and viands before them, as if they
were really partaking of the things offered in
sacrifice. This ceremony was called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lectisternium</i>.
The woodcut here introduced exhibits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
one of these couches, which is represented
with a cushion covered by a cloth

beautiful <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulvinar</i> is wrought altogether in
white marble, and is somewhat more than
two feet in height.</p>

<p id="Lectus">LECTUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λέχος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλίνη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐνή</span>), a bed. The
complete bed (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐνή</span>) of a wealthy Greek in
later times generally consisted of the following
parts:&mdash;<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλίνη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτονοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τυλεῖον</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κνέφαλον</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσκεφάλειον</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρώματα</span>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλίνη</span>
is, properly speaking, merely the bedstead,
and seems to have consisted only of posts
fitted into one another and resting upon four
feet. At the head part alone there was a
board (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><ins class="corr" id="tn-222" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'ἀνάκλίντρον'">
ἀνάκλιντρον</ins></span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκλιντρον</span>) to support
the pillow and prevent its falling out.
Sometimes, however, the bottom part of a
bedstead was likewise protected by a board,
so that in this case a Greek bedstead resembled
what we call a French bedstead. The
bedstead was provided with girths (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόνοι</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτονοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κειρία</span>) on which the bed or mattress
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κνέφαλον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τυλεῖον</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύλη</span>) rested. The
cover or ticking of a mattress was made of
linen or woollen cloth, or of leather, and
the usual material with which it was filled
was either wool or dried weeds. At the head
part of the bed, and supported by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίκλιντρον</span>,
lay a round pillow (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσκεφάλειον</span>) to
support the head. The bed-covers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρώματα</span>)
were generally made of cloth, which was very
thick and woolly, either on one or on both sides.
The beds of the Romans (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lecti cubiculares</i>) in
the earlier periods of the republic were probably
of the same description as those used
in Greece; but towards the end of the republic
and during the empire, the richness and
magnificence of the beds of the wealthy Romans
far surpassed every thing we find described
in Greece. The bedstead was generally
rather high, so that persons entered the
bed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scandere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ascendere</i>) by means of steps
placed beside it (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scamnum</i>). It was sometimes
made of metal, and sometimes of costly
kinds of wood, or veneered with tortoise-shell
or ivory; its feet (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fulcra</i>) were frequently
of silver or gold. The bed or mattress
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">culcita</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">torus</i>) rested upon girths or
strings (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">restes</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fasciae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">institae</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funes</i>),
which connected the two horizontal side-posts
of the bed. In beds destined for two persons
the two sides are distinguished by different
names; the side at which persons entered
was open, and bore the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sponda</i>; the
other side, which was protected by a board,
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pluteus</i>. The two sides of such a
bed are also distinguished by the names <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">torus
exterior</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">torus interior</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sponda exterior</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sponda interior</i>; and from these
expressions it is not improbable that such
lecti had two beds or mattresses, one for each
person. Mattresses were in the earlier times
filled with dry herbs or straw, and such
beds continued to be used by the poor. But
in subsequent times wool, and, at a still later
period, feathers, were used by the wealthy
for the beds as well as the pillows. The
cloth or ticking (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">operimentum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">involucrum</i>)
with which the beds or mattresses were
covered, was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toral</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">torale</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linteum</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">segestre</i>. The blankets or counterpanes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestes
stragulae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stragula</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peristromata</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peripetasmata</i>)
were in the houses of wealthy Romans
of the most costly description, and generally
of a purple colour, and embroidered with
beautiful figures in gold. Covers of this sort
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peripetasmata Attalica</i>, because
they were said to have been first used at the
court of Attalus. The pillows were likewise
covered with magnificent casings. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lectus
genialis</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adversus</i> was the bridal bed,
which stood in the atrium, opposite the
janua, whence it derived the epithet <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adversus</i>.
It was generally high, with steps
by its side, and in later times beautifully
adorned. Respecting the lectus funebris see
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a></span>. An account of the disposition of the
couches used at entertainments is given under

<p id="Legatio">LĒGĀTĬO LĪBĔRA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Legatus">Legatus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Legatum">LĒGĀTUM, a part of the hereditas which
a testator gives out of it, from the heres (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab
herede</i>); that is, it is a gift to a person out of
that whole (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">universum</i>) which is diminished
to the heres by such gift. There were several
laws limiting the amount of property which
a person might give in legacies; and it was
at last fixed by the Lex Falcidia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 40),
that he should not bequeath more than three-fourths
of his property in legacies, and thus
a fourth was left to the heres. By the Law
of the Twelve Tables a man could dispose of
his property as he pleased, and he might
exhaust (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erogare</i>) the whole hereditas by
legacies and bequests of freedom to slaves, so
as to leave the heres nothing. The consequence
was that in such cases the scripti
heredes refused to take the hereditas, and
there was of course an intestacy. Legata
were inutilia or void, if they were given
before a heres was instituted by the will, for
the will derived all its legal efficacy from
such institution; there was the same rule as
to a gift of freedom.</p>


<p id="Legatus">LĒGĀTUS, from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lego</i>, a person commissioned
or deputed to do certain things. They
may be divided into three classes:&mdash;1. Legati
or ambassadors sent to Rome by foreign
nations; 2. Legati or ambassadors sent from
Rome to foreign nations and into the provinces;
3. Legati who accompanied the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
generals into the field, or the proconsuls
and praetors into the provinces. 1. Foreign
legati at Rome, from whatever country they
came, had to go to the temple of Saturn, and
deposit their names with the quaestors. Previous
to their admission into the city, foreign
ambassadors seem to have been obliged to
give notice from what nation they came and
for what purpose; for several instances are
mentioned, in which ambassadors were prohibited
from entering the city, especially in
case of a war between Rome and the state
from which they came. In such cases the
ambassadors were either not heard at all,
and obliged to quit Italy, or an audience was
given to them by the senate (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus legatis
datur</i>) outside the city, in the temple of Bellona.
This was evidently a sign of mistrust,
but the ambassadors were nevertheless treated
as public guests, and some public villa outside
the city was sometimes assigned for their
reception. In other cases, however, as soon
as the report of the landing of foreign ambassadors
on the coast of Italy was brought
to Rome, especially if they were persons of
great distinction, or if they came from an
ally of the Roman people, some one of the
inferior magistrates, or a legatus of a consul,
was despatched by the senate to receive, and
conduct them to the city at the expense of
the republic. When they were introduced
into the senate by the praetor or consul, they
first explained what they had to communicate,
and then the praetor invited the senators
to put their questions to the ambassadors.
The whole transaction was carried on by
interpreters, and in the Latin language.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Interpres">Interpres</a>.</span>] After the ambassadors had
thus been examined, they were requested to
leave the assembly of the senate, who now
began to discuss the subject brought before
them. The result was communicated to the
ambassadors by the praetor. In some cases
ambassadors not only received rich presents
on their departure, but were at the command
of the senate conducted by a magistrate, and
at the public expense, to the frontier of Italy,
and even farther. By the Lex Gabinia it
was decreed, that from the 1st of February
to the 1st of March, the senate should every
day give audience to foreign ambassadors.
There was a place on the right-hand side of
the senate-house, called Graecostasis, in
which foreign ambassadors waited. All ambassadors,
whencesoever they came, were
considered by the Romans throughout the
whole period of their existence as sacred and
inviolable. 2. Legati to foreign nations in
the name of the Roman republic were always
sent by the senate; and to be appointed to
such a mission was considered a great honour,
which was conferred only on men of high
rank or eminence: for a Roman ambassador
had the powers of a magistrate and the venerable
character of a priest. If a Roman
during the performance of his mission as
ambassador died or was killed, his memory
was honoured by the republic with a public
sepulchre and a statue in the Rostra. The
expenses during the journey of an ambassador
were, of course, paid by the republic; and
when he travelled through a province, the
provincials had to supply him with every
thing he wanted. 3. The third class of
legati, to whom the name of ambassadors
cannot be applied, were persons who accompanied
the Roman generals on their expeditions,
and in later times the governors of
provinces also. They are mentioned at a very
early period as serving along with the tribunes,
under the consuls. They were nominated
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legabantur</i>) by the consul or the dictator
under whom they served, but the
sanction of the senate was an essential point,
without which no one could be legally considered
a legatus. The persons appointed to
this office were usually men of great military
talents, and it was their duty to advise and
assist their superior in all his undertakings,
and to act in his stead both in civil and military
affairs. The legati were thus always
men in whom the consul placed great confidence,
and were frequently his friends or
relations: but they had no power independent
of the command of their general. Their
number varied according to the greatness or
importance of the war, or the extent of the
province: three is the smallest number that
we know of, but Pompey, when in Asia, had
fifteen legati. Whenever the consuls were
absent from the army, or when a proconsul
left his province, the legati or one of them
took his place, and then had the insignia as
well as the power of his superior. He was in
this case called legatus pro praetore, and
hence we sometimes read that a man governed
a province as legatus without any mention
being made of the proconsul whose vicegerent
he was. During the latter period of the republic,
it sometimes happened that a consul
carried on a war, or a proconsul governed
his province, through his legati, while he
himself remained at Rome, or conducted some
other more urgent affairs. When the provinces
were divided at the time of the empire
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Provincia">Provincia</a></span>], those of the Roman people were
governed by men who had been either consuls
or praetors, and the former were always
accompanied by three legati, the latter by
one. The provinces of the emperor, who
was himself the proconsul, were governed by
persons whom the emperor himself appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
and who had been consuls or praetors, or
were at least senators. These vicegerents of
the emperor were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legati augusti pro
praetore</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legati praetorii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legati consulares</i>, or
simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legati</i>, and they, like the governors of
the provinces of the Roman people, had one
or three legati as their assistants. During
the latter period of the republic it had become
customary for senators to obtain from the
senate the permission to travel through or
stay in any province at the expense of the
provincials, merely for the purpose of managing
and conducting their own personal
affairs. There was no restraint as to the
length of time the senators were allowed to
avail themselves of this privilege, which was
a heavy burden upon the provincials. This
mode of sojourning in a province was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatio libera</i>, because those who availed
themselves of it enjoyed all the privileges of
a public legatus or ambassador, without
having any of his duties to perform. At the
time of Cicero the privilege of legatio libera
was abused to a very great extent. Cicero,
therefore, in his consulship (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63) endeavoured
to put an end to it, but, owing to the
opposition of a tribune, he only succeeded in
limiting the time of its duration to one year.
Julius Caesar afterwards extended the time
during which a senator might avail himself
of the legatio libera to five years.</p>

<p id="Leiturgia">LEITURGIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λειτουργία</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λεῖτον</span>, Ion.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λήϊτον</span>, <em>i.e.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημόσιον</span>, or, according to others,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρυτανεῖον</span>), a liturgy, is the name of certain
personal services which, at Athens, every
citizen who possessed a certain amount of
property had to perform towards the state.
These personal services, which in all cases
were connected with considerable expenses,
were at first a natural consequence of the
greater political privileges enjoyed by the
wealthy, who, in return, had also to perform
heavier duties towards the republic; but
when the Athenian democracy was at its
height the original character of these liturgies
became changed, for, as every citizen
now enjoyed the same rights and privileges
as the wealthiest, they were simply a tax
upon property connected with personal labour
and exertion. All liturgies may be divided
into two classes: 1, ordinary or encyclic
liturgies (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐγκύκλιοι λειτουργίαι</span>); and 2, extraordinary
liturgies. The former were called
encyclic, because they recurred every year
at certain festive seasons, and comprised the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Choregia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gymnasiarchia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lampadarchia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Architheoria</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hestiasis</i>. Every Athenian
who possessed three talents and above was
subject to them, and they were undertaken
in turns by the members of every tribe who
possessed the property qualification just mentioned,
unless some one volunteered to undertake
a liturgy for another person. But
the law did not allow any one to be compelled
to undertake more than one liturgy
at a time, and he who had in one year performed
a liturgy was free for the next, so
that legally a person had to perform a liturgy
only every other year. Those whose turn it
was to undertake any of the ordinary liturgies
were always appointed by their own tribe.
The persons who were exempt from all kinds
of liturgies were the nine archons, heiresses,
and orphans until after the commencement
of the second year of their coming of age.
Sometimes the exemption from liturgies
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτελεία</span>) was granted to persons for especial
merits towards the republic. The only kind
of extraordinary liturgy to which the name
is properly applied is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trierarchia</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριηραρχία</span>); in the earlier times, however,
the service in the armies was in reality no
more than an extraordinary liturgy. [See
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Eisphora">Eisphora</a></span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Trierarchia">Trierarchia</a></span>.] In later times,
during and after the Peloponnesian war,
when the expenses of a liturgy were found
too heavy for one person, we find that in
many instances two persons combined to
defray its expenses. Such was the case with
the choragia and the trierarchy.</p>


<p id="Lembus">LEMBUS, a skiff or small boat, used for
carrying a person from a ship to the shore.
The name was also given to the light boats
which were sent ahead of a fleet to obtain
information of the enemy’s movements.</p>


<p id="Lemniscus">LEMNISCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λημνίσκος</span>), a kind of coloured
ribbon which hung down from crowns
or diadems at the back part of the head.
Coronae adorned with lemnisci were a greater
distinction than those without them. This
serves to explain an expression of Cicero
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palma lemniscata, pro Rosc. Am.</i> 35), where
palma means a victory, and the epithet lemniscata
indicates the contrary of infamis, and
at the same time implies an honourable as
well as lucrative victory. Lemnisci were
also worn alone and without being connected
with crowns, especially by ladies, as an ornament
for the head.</p>


<p id="Lemuria">LĔMŬRĬA, a festival for the souls of the
departed, which was celebrated at Rome
every year in the month of May. It was
said to have been instituted by Romulus to
appease the spirit of Remus, whom he had
slain, and to have been called originally
Remuria. It was celebrated at night and in
silence, and during three alternate days, that
is, on the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth of
May. During this season the temples of the
gods were closed, and it was thought unlucky
for women to marry at this time and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
during the whole month of May, and those
who ventured to marry were believed to die
soon after, whence the proverb, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mense Maio
malae nubent</i>. Those who celebrated the
Lemuria walked barefooted, washed their
hands three times, and threw black beans
nine times behind their backs, believing by
this ceremony to secure themselves against
the Lemures. As regards the solemnities on
each of the three days, we only know that on
the second there were games in the circus in
honour of Mars, and that on the third day
the images of the thirty Argei, made of
rushes, were thrown from the Pons Sublicius
into the Tiber by the Vestal virgins [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Argei">Argei</a></span>].
On the same day there was a festival of the
merchants, probably because on this day the
temple of Mercury had been dedicated in the
year 495 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>


<p id="Lenaea">LĒNAEA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Dionysia">Dionysia</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Lesche">LESCHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λέσχη</span>), an Ionic word, signifying
<em>council</em> or <em>conversation</em>, and <em>a place for
council or conversation</em>. There is frequent
mention of places of public resort, in the
Greek cities, by the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leschae</i>, some
set apart for the purpose, and others so called
because they were so used by loungers; to
the latter class belong the agora and its porticoes,
the gymnasia, and the shops of various
tradesmen. The former class were small
buildings or porticoes, furnished with seats,
and exposed to the sun, to which the idle
resorted to enjoy conversation, and the poor
to obtain warmth and shelter: at Athens
alone there were 360 such. In the Dorian
states the word retained the meaning of a
place of meeting for deliberation and intercourse,
a council-chamber or club-room.
There were generally chambers for council
and conversation, called by this name, attached
to the temples of Apollo. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lesche</i>
at Delphi was celebrated through Greece for
the paintings with which it was adorned by
Polygnotus.</p>


<p id="Lex">LEX. Of Roman leges, viewed with reference
to the mode of enactment, there were
properly two kinds, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Curiatae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges
Centuriatae</i>. Plebiscita are improperly called
leges, though they were laws, and in the
course of time had the same effect as leges.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plebiscitum">Plebiscitum</a>.</span>] Originally the leges curiatae
were the only leges, and they were passed by
the populus in the comitia curiata. After
the establishment of the comitia centuriata,
the comitia curiata fell almost into disuse;
but so long as the republic lasted, and even
under Augustus, a shadow of the old constitution
was preserved in the formal conferring
of the imperium by a lex curiata only, and
in the ceremony of adrogation being effected
only in these comitia. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Adoptio">Adoptio</a>.</span>] Those
leges, properly so called, with which we are
acquainted, were passed in the comitia centuriata,
and were proposed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogabantur</i>) by
a magistratus of senatorial rank, after the
senate had approved of them by a decretum.
Such a lex was also designated by the name
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populi Scitum</i>.&mdash;The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogatio</i> (from the
verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogo</i>) properly means any measure proposed
to the legislative body, and therefore
is equally applicable to a proposed lex and a
proposed plebiscitum. It corresponds to our
word <em>bill</em>, as opposed to <em>act</em>. When the
measure was passed, it became a lex or plebiscitum;
though rogationes, after they had
become laws, were sometimes, but improperly,
called rogationes. A rogatio began
with the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velitis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jubeatis</i>, &amp;c., and
ended with the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ita vos Quirites rogo</i>.
The corresponding expression of assent to
the rogatio on the part of the sovereign assembly
was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uti rogas</i>. The phrases for proposing
a law are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogare legem</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legem ferre</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogationem promulgare</i>; the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogationem
accipere</i> applies to the enacting body.
The terms relating to legislation are thus
explained by Ulpian the jurist:&mdash;“A lex is
said either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogari</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferri</i>; it is said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">abrogari</i>,
when it is repealed; it is said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">derogari</i>,
when a part is repealed; it is said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subrogari</i>,
when some addition is made to it; and it
is said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obrogari</i>, when some part of it is
changed.”&mdash;A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">privilegium</i> is an enactment
that had for its object a single person, which
is indicated by the form of the word (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">privilegium</i>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">privae res</i> being the same as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">singulae
res</i>. The word privilegium did not convey
any notion of the character of the legislative
measures; it might be beneficial to the party
to whom it referred, or it might not. Under
the empire, the word is used in the sense of
a special grant proceeding from the imperial
favour.&mdash;The title of a lex was generally derived
from the gentile name of the magistratus
who proposed it, as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Hortensia</i>
from the dictator Hortensius. Sometimes
the lex took its name from the two consuls
or other magistrates, as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acilia Calpurnia</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aelia</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aelia Sentia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papia</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papia Poppaea</i>,
and others. It seems to have been the fashion
to omit the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et</i> between the two
names, though instances occur in which it was
used. A lex was also designated, with reference
to its object, as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Cincia de Donis
et Muneribus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Furia Testamentaria</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex
Julia Municipalis</i>, and many others. Leges
which related to a common object, were often
designated by a collective name, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges
Agrariae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Judiciariae</i>, and others. A lex
sometimes took its name from the chief contents
of its first chapter, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Julia de
Maritandis Ordinibus</i>. Sometimes a lex<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
comprised very various provisions, relating
to matters essentially different, and in that
case it was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Satura</i>.&mdash;The number
of leges was greatly increased in the later
part of the republican period, and Julius
Caesar is said to have contemplated a revision
of the whole body. Under him and Augustus
numerous enactments were passed, which
are known under the general name of Juliae
Leges. It is often stated that no leges, properly
so called, or plebiscita, were passed
after the time of Augustus; but this is a
mistake. Though the voting might be a mere
form, still the form was kept. Besides, various
leges are mentioned as having been passed
under the Empire, such as the Lex Junia
under Tiberius, the Lex Visellia, the Lex
Mamilia under Caligula, and a Lex Claudia
on the tutela of women. It does not appear
when the ancient forms of legislation were
laid aside. A particular enactment is always
referred to by its name. The following is a
list of the principal leges, properly so called;
but the list includes also various plebiscita
and privilegia:&mdash;</p>

<p id="Aelia">AELIA. This lex and a Fufia Lex, passed

that until this law was passed, any
office might be enjoyed by a citizen after

had prescribed certain regular forms of proceeding
for the censors in exercising their
functions as inspectors of mores, and had required
the concurrence of both censors to
inflict the nota censoria. When a senator

to the plebs, and likewise that part of the
public land possessed by the patricians should
be distributed among the plebeians. This
law met with the most violent opposition,

M. Cincius Alimentus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 204). It forbade
a person to take any thing for his pains in
pleading a cause. In the time of Augustus,
the Lex Cincia was confirmed by a senatus-consultum,
and a penalty of four times the
sum received was imposed on the advocate.
The law was so far modified in the time of
Claudius, that an advocate was allowed to
receive ten sestertia; if he took any sum
beyond that, he was liable to be prosecuted
for repetundae. It appears that this permission
was so far restricted in Trajan’s time,
that the fee could not be paid till the work

<p id="Duodecim_t">DŬŎDĔCIM TĂBŬLĀRUM. In the year
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 454 the Senate assented to a Plebiscitum,
pursuant to which commissioners were to be
sent to Athens and the Greek cities generally,
in order to make themselves acquainted with
their laws. Three commissioners were appointed
for the purpose. On the return of
the commissioners, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 452, it was agreed
that persons should be appointed to draw up
the code of laws (decemviri Legibus scribundis),
but they were to be chosen only from
the Patricians, with a provision that the
rights of the Plebeians should be respected
by the decemviri in drawing up the laws.
In the following year (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 451) the Decemviri
were appointed in the Comitia Centuriata,
and during the time of their office no
other magistratus were chosen. The body
consisted of ten Patricians, including the
three commissioners who had been sent
abroad: Appius Claudius, Consul designatus,
was at the head of the body. Ten Tables of
Laws were prepared during the year, and
after being approved by the Senate were confirmed
by the Comitia Centuriata. As it was
considered that some further Laws were
wanted, Decemviri were again elected <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
450, consisting of Appius Claudius and his
friends. Two more Tables were added by
these Decemviri, which Cicero calls “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duae
tabulae iniquarum legum</span>.” The provision<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
which allowed no connubium between the
Patres and the Plebs is referred to the
Eleventh Table. The whole Twelve Tables
were first published in the consulship of L.
Valerius and M. Horatius after the downfall
of the Decemviri, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 449. This the first
attempt to make a code remained also the
only attempt for near one thousand years,
until the legislation of Justinian. The
Twelve Tables are mentioned by the Roman
writers under a great variety of names:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Decemvirales</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Decemviralis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges
XII.</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex XII. tabularum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Duodecim</i>, and
sometimes they are referred to under the
names of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex</i> simply, as being
pre-eminently The Law. The Laws were
cut on bronze tablets and put up in a public
place. They contained matters relating both
to the Jus Publicum and the Jus Privatum
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fons publici privatique juris</i>). The Jus
Publicum underwent great changes in the
course of years, but the Jus Privatum of the
Twelve Tables continued to be the fundamental
law of the Roman State. The Roman
writers speak in high terms of the precision
of the enactments contained in the Twelve
Tables, and of the propriety of the language
in which they were expressed.</p>

The possessiones and res were to be estimated

The result was, that the creditor lost

found near the Gulf of Tarentum and in the
neighbourhood of the city of ancient Heraclea,
large fragments of a bronze table,
which contained on one side a Roman lex,
and on the other a Greek inscription. The
whole is now in the Museo Borbonico at
Naples. The lex contains various provisions
as to the police of the city of Rome, and as
to the constitution of communities of Roman
citizens (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">municipia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coloniae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praefecturae</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fora</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conciliabula civium Romanorum</i>). It

<p id="Lex_jpp"><span class="smcap">Julia et Papia Poppaea.</span> Augustus appears
to have caused a lex to be enacted
about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 18, which is cited as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Julia
de Maritandis Ordinibus</i>, and is referred to
in the Carmen Seculare of Horace, which was
written in the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 17. The object of
this lex was to regulate marriages, as to
which it contained numerous provisions; but
it appears not to have come into operation
till the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 13. In the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 9,
and in the consulship of M. Papius Mutilus
and Q. Poppaeus Secundus (consules suffecti),
another lex was passed as a kind of amendment
and supplement to the former lex, and
hence arose the title of Lex Julia et Papia
Poppaea, by which this lex is often quoted.
The lex is often variously quoted, according
as reference is made to its various provisions;
sometimes it is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Julia</i>, sometimes
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papia Poppaea</i>, sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Julia et Papia</i>,
sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex de Maritandis Ordinibus</i>,
from the chapter which treated of the marriages
of the senators, sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Caducaria,
Decimaria</i>, &amp;c. from the various chapters.
The Lex Julia forbade the marriage
of a senator or senator’s children with a
libertina, with a woman whose father or
mother had followed an ars ludicra, and with
a prostitute; and also the marriage of a
libertinus with a senator’s daughter. In
order to promote marriage, various penalties
were imposed on those who lived in a state
of celibacy (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caelibatus</i>) after a certain age,
and various privileges were given to those
who had three or more children. A candidate
for the public offices who had several
children was preferred to one who had fewer.
After the passing of this lex, it became usual
for the senate, and afterwards the emperor
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">princeps</i>), to give occasionally, as a privilege
to certain persons who had not children, the
same advantage that the lex secured to those
who had children. This was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus
Liberorum</i>, and sometimes the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus trium
Liberorum</i>.</p>

<p id="Liciniae">LĬCĬNIAE, proposed by C. Licinius, who
was tribune of the people from <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 376 to
367, and who brought the contest between
the patricians and plebeians to a happy termination.
He was supported in his exertions
by his colleague L. Sextius. The laws
which he proposed were: 1. That in future
no more consular tribunes should be appointed,
but that consuls should be elected
as in former times, one of whom should always
be a plebeian. 2. That no one should possess
more than 500 jugera of the public land, nor
keep upon it more than 100 head of large,
or 500 of small cattle. It is related that
Licinius was accused and condemned for violating
his own law. Livy states that Licinius,
together with his son, held 1000 jugera of
the public land, and by emancipating his son
had acted in fraud of the law. The son thus
possessed 500 jugera in his own name, while
his father had the actual enjoyment. 3. A law
regulating the affairs between debtor and creditor,
which ordained that the interest already
paid for borrowed money should be deducted
from the capital, and that the remainder of
the latter should be paid back in three yearly
instalments. 4. That the Sibylline books
should be entrusted to a college of ten men
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decemviri</i>), half of whom should be plebeians,
in order that no falsifications might
be introduced in favour of the patricians.
These rogations were passed after a most
vehement opposition on the part of the patricians,
and L. Sextius was the first plebeian
who, in accordance with the first of them,
obtained the consulship for the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
366.</p>


<p id="Licinia_m">LĬCĬNIA, also called MANLĬA, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 196,

low rate, and admitting the foederatae civitates
to the Roman civitas. He is also said
to have been the mover of a law for adulterating
silver by mixing with it an eighth

the senate declared that all his laws were
passed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contra auspicia</i>, and were therefore

adds Cicero, “was a great thing to accomplish,

<p><span class="smcap">Tribunitia</span> (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 70), restored the old tribunitia

<p id="Porcia">PORCIA DE PRŌVINCIIS, about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
198, the enactments of which are doubtful.</p>


<p id="Publicia">PUBLĬCĬA, permitted betting at certain
games which required strength.</p>


<p id="Publilia">PUBLĪLĬA. In the consulship of L. Pinarius
and P. Furius, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 471, the tribune
Publilius Volero proposed, in the assembly of
the tribes, that the tribunes should in future
be appointed in the comitia of the tribes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut
plebeii magistratus tributis comitiis fierent</i>),
instead of by the centuries, as had formerly
been the case; since the clients of the patricians
were so numerous in the centuries, that
the plebeians could not elect whom they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
wished. This measure was violently opposed
by the patricians, who prevented the tribes
from coming to any resolution respecting it
throughout this year; but in the following
year, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 471, Publilius was re-elected tribune,
and together with him C. Laetorius, a
man of still greater resolution than Publilius.
Fresh measures were added to the former
proposition: the aediles were to be chosen
by the tribes, as well as the tribunes, and the
tribes were to be competent to deliberate and
determine on all matters affecting the whole
nation, and not such only as might concern
the plebes. This proposition, though still
more violently resisted by the patricians than
the one of the previous year, was carried.
Some said that the number of the tribunes
was now for the first time raised to five, having
been only two previously.</p>


<p id="Publiliae">PUBLĪLĬAE, proposed by the dictator Q.
Publilius Philo, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 339. According to
Livy, there were three Publiliae Leges. 1.
The first is said to have enacted, that plebiscita
should bind all Quirites, which is to the
same purport as the Lex Hortensia of <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
286. It is probable, however, that the object
of this law was to render the approval of the
senate a sufficient confirmation of a plebiscitum,
and to make the confirmation of the
curiae unnecessary. 2. The second law
enacted, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut legum quae comitiis centuriatis
ferrerentur ante initum suffragium patres
auctores fierent</i>. By patres Livy here means
the curiae; and accordingly this law made
the confirmation of the curiae a mere formality
in reference to all laws submitted to
the comitia centuriata, since every law proposed
by the senate to the centuries was to
be considered to have the sanction of the
curiae also. 3. The third law enacted that
one of the two censors should necessarily be
a plebeian. It is probable that there was
also a fourth law, which applied the Licinian
law to the praetorship as well as to the censorship,
and which provided that in each
alternate year the praetor should be a
plebeian.</p>


<p id="Pupia">PŪPĬA, mentioned by Cicero, seems to
have enacted that the senate could not meet
on comitiales dies.</p>


<p id="Quintia">QUINTĬA, was a lex proposed by T. Quintius
Crispinus, consul <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 9, for the preservation
of the aquaeductus.</p>


<p id="Regia">RĒGĬA. A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Regia</i> during the kingly
period of Roman history might have a two-fold
meaning. In the first place it was a
law which had been passed by the comitia
under the presidency of the king, and was
thus distinguished from a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Tribunicia</i>,
which was passed by the comitia under the
presidency of the tribunus celerum. In later
times all laws, the origin of which was attributed
to the time of the kings, were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Regiae</i>, though it by no means follows
that they were all passed under the presidency
of the kings, and much less, that they
were enacted by the kings without the sanction
of the curies. Some of these laws were
preserved and followed at a very late period
of Roman history. A collection of them was
made, though at what time is uncertain, by
Papisius or Papirius, and this compilation
was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Civile Papirianum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papisianum</i>.
The second meaning of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Regia</i>
during the kingly period was undoubtedly
the same as that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Curiata de Imperio</i>.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Imperium">Imperium</a>.</span>] This indeed is not
mentioned by any ancient writer, but must
be inferred from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Regia</i> which we
meet with under the empire, for the name
could scarcely have been invented then; it
must have come down from early times, when
its meaning was similar, though not nearly
so extensive. During the empire the curies
continued to hold their meetings, though they
were only a shadow of those of former times;
and after the election of a new emperor,
they conferred upon him the imperium in
the ancient form by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Curiata de Imperio</i>,
which was now usually called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex
Regia</i>. The imperium, however, which this
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Regia Lex</i> conferred upon an emperor, was
of a very different nature from that which in
former times it had conferred upon the kings.
It now embraced all the rights and powers
which the populus Romanus had formerly
possessed, so that the emperor became what
formerly the populus had been, that is, the
sovereign power in the state. A fragment of
such a lex regia, conferring the imperium
upon Vespasian, engraved upon a brazen
table, is still extant in the Lateran at Rome.</p>


<p id="Remnia">REMNĬA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Calumnia">Calumnia</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Repetundarum">RĔPĔTUNDĀRUM. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Repetundae">Repetundae</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Rhodia">RHŎDĬA. The Rhodians had a maritime
code which was highly esteemed. Some of
its provisions were adopted by the Romans,
and have thus been incorporated into the
maritime law of European states. It was
not, however, a lex in the proper sense of
the term.</p>


<p id="Roscia">ROSCĬA THEĀTRĀLIS, proposed by the
tribune L. Roscius Otho, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 67, which gave
the equites a special place at the public
spectacles in fourteen rows or seats (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in quatuordecim
gradibus sive ordinibus</i>) next to
the place of the senators, which was in the
orchestra. This lex also assigned a certain
place to spendthrifts. The phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sedere in
quatuordecim ordinibus</i> is equivalent to having
the proper census equestris which was
required by the lex. There are numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
allusions to this lex, which is sometimes
simply called the Lex of Otho, or referred to
by his name. It is erroneously supposed by
some writers to have been enacted in the consulship
of Cicero, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63.</p>


<p id="Rubria">RUBRĬA. The province of Gallia Cisalpina
ceased to be a provincia, and became
a part of Italia, about the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 43.
When this change took place, it was necessary
to provide for the administration of
justice, as the usual modes of provincial
administration would cease with the determination
of the provincial form of government.
This was effected by a lex, a large
part of which, on a bronze tablet, is preserved
in the Museum at Parma. The name
of this lex is not known, but it is supposed
by some to be the Lex Rubria.</p>


<p id="Rupiliae">RŬPĬLĬAE LĒGES (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 131), were the
regulations established by P. Rupilius, and
ten legati, for the administration of the province
of Sicily, after the close of the first
servile war. They were made in pursuance
of a consultum of the senate. Cicero speaks
of these regulations as a decretum of Rupilius,
which he says they call Lex Rupilia;
but it was not a lex proper. The powers
given to the commissioners by the Lex Julia
Municipalis were of a similar kind.</p>


<p id="Sacratae">SĂCRĀTAE. Leges were properly so called
which had for their object to make a thing or
person <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacer</i>. A lex sacrata militaris is also
mentioned by Livy.</p>

<p id="Semproniae">SEMPRŌNĬAE, the name of various laws
proposed by Tiberius and Caius Sempronius
Gracchus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Agraria.</span> In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 133 the tribune Tib.
Gracchus revived the Agrarian law of Licinius
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Liciniae">Leges Liciniae</a></span>]: he proposed that no
one should possess more than 500 jugera of
the public land, and that the surplus land
should be divided among the poor citizens,
who were not to have the power of alienating
it: he also proposed, as a compensation to
the possessors deprived of the land on which
they had frequently made improvements, that
the former possessors should have the full
ownership of 500 jugera, and each of their
sons, if they had any, half that quantity:
finally, that three commissioners (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triumviri</i>)
should be appointed every year to carry the
law into effect. This law naturally met with
the greatest opposition, but it was eventually
passed in the year in which it was proposed,
and Tib. Gracchus, C. Gracchus, and Appius
Claudius were the three commissioners appointed
under it. It was, however, never
carried fully into effect, in consequence of
the murder of Tib. Gracchus. Owing to the
difficulties which were experienced in carrying
his brother’s agrarian law into effect, it was
again brought forward by C. Gracchus, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 123.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Capite Civium Romanorum</span>, proposed
by C. Gracchus <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 123, enacted that the
people only should decide respecting the
caput or civil condition of a citizen. This
law continued in force till the latest times of
the republic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frumentaria</span>, proposed by C. Gracchus
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 123, enacted that corn should be sold by
the state to the people once a month at the
price of 6⅓ asses for each modius, which was
equal to 1 gallon and nearly 8 pints English.
This was only a trifle more than half the
market price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Judiciaria.</span> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Judex">Judex</a></span>, <a href="#Page_216">p. 216</a>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Militaris</span>, proposed by C. Gracchus <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
123, enacted that the soldiers should receive
their clothing gratis, and that no one should
be enrolled as a soldier under the age of
seventeen. Previously a fixed sum was deducted
from the pay for all clothes and arms
issued to the soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ne quis Judicio circumveniretur</span>, proposed
by C. Gracchus, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 123, punished all
who conspired to obtain the condemnation of
a person in a judicium publicum. One of
the provisions of the Lex Cornelia de Sicariis
was to the same effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">De Provinciis Consularibus</span>, proposed by
C. Gracchus <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 123, enacted that the senate
should fix each year, before the comitia for
electing the consuls were held, the two provinces
which were to be allotted to the two
new consuls. There was also a Sempronian
law concerning the province of Asia, which
probably did not form part of the Lex de
Provinciis Consularibus: it enacted that the
taxes of this province should be let out to
farm by the censors at Rome. This law was
afterwards repealed by J. Caesar.</p>


<p id="Sempronia">SEMPRŌNIA DE FĒNŎRE, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 193, was
a plebiscitum proposed by a tribune, M. Sempronius,
which enacted that the law (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus</i>)
about money lent (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecunia credita</i>) should
be the same for the Socii and Latini (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socii ac
nomen Latinum</i>) as for Roman citizens. The
object of the lex was to prevent Romans from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
lending money in the name of the Socii, who
were not bound by the fenebres leges. The
lex could obviously only apply within the
jurisdiction of Rome.</p>


<p id="Servilia">SERVĪLĬA AGRĀRIA, proposed by the
tribune P. S. Rullus in the consulship of
Cicero, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63, was a very extensive agrarian
rogatio. It was successfully opposed by
Cicero; but it was in substance carried by
J. Caesar, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 59 [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Juliae">Lex Julia Agraria</a></span>], and
is the lex called by Cicero <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Campana</i>,
from the public land called ager campanus
being assigned under this lex.</p>

<p id="Sulpiciae">SULPĬCĬAE, proposed by the tribune
P. Sulpicius Rufus, a supporter of Marius,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 88, enacted the recall of the exiles, the
distribution of the new citizens and the
libertini among the thirty-five tribes, that
the command in the Mithridatic war should
be taken from Sulla and given to Marius,
and that a senator should not contract debt
to the amount of more than 2000 denarii.
The last enactment may have been intended
to expel persons from the senate who should
get in debt. All these leges were repealed
by Sulla.</p>


<p id="Sulpicia">SULPĬCĬA SEMPRŌNĬA, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 304. No
name is given to this lex by Livy, but it was
probably proposed by the consuls. It prevented
the dedicatio of a templum or altar
without the consent of the senate or a majority
of the tribunes.</p>


<p id="Sumptuariae">SUMPTUĀRĬAE, the name of various laws
passed to prevent inordinate expense (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sumptus</i>)
in banquets, dress, &amp;c. In the states
of antiquity it was considered the duty of
government to put a check upon extravagance
in the private expenses of persons,
and among the Romans in particular we find
traces of this in the laws attributed to the
kings, and in the Twelve Tables. The censors,
to whom was entrusted the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disciplina</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cura morum</i>, punished by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nota censoria</i>
all persons guilty of what was then
regarded as a luxurious mode of living; a
great many instances of this kind are recorded.
But as the love of luxury greatly increased
with the foreign conquests of the republic
and the growing wealth of the nation, various
leges sumptuariae were passed at different
times with the object of restraining it. These,
however, as may be supposed, rarely accomplished
their object, and in the latter times
of the republic they were virtually repealed.
The following list of them is arranged in
chronological order:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oppia</span>, proposed by the tribune C. Oppius
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 215, enacted that no woman should
have above half an ounce of gold, nor wear a
dress of different colours, nor ride in a carriage
in the city or in any town, or within a
mile of it, unless on account of public sacrifices.
This law was repealed twenty years
afterwards, whence we frequently find the
Lex Orchia mentioned as the first lex sumptuaria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orchia</span>, proposed by the tribune C. Orchius
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 181, limited the number of guests to
be present at entertainments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fannia</span>, proposed by the consul C. Fannius,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 61, limited the sums which were to be
spent on entertainments, and enacted that
not more than 100 asses should be spent on
certain festivals named in the lex, whence it
is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centussis</i> by Lucilius; that on ten
other days in each month not more than 30
asses, and that on all other days not more
than 10 asses, should be expended; also
that no other fowl but one hen should be
served up, and that not fattened for the
purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Didia</span>, passed <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 143, extended the Lex
Fannia to the whole of Italy, and enacted
that not only those who gave entertainments
which exceeded in expense what the law
had prescribed, but also all who were present
at such entertainments, should be liable to
the penalties of the law. We are not, however,
told in what these consisted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Licinia</span>, agreed in its chief provisions with
the Lex Fannia, and was brought forward,
we are told, that there might be the authority
of a new law upon the subject, inasmuch
as the Lex Fannia was beginning to be neglected.
It allowed 200 asses to be spent on
entertainments upon marriage days, and on
other days the same as the Lex Fannia; also,
that on ordinary days there should not be
served up more than three pounds of fresh,
and one pound of salt meat. It was probably
passed in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 103.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornelia</span>, a law of the dictator Sulla, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
81, was enacted on account of the neglect of
the Fannian and Licinian Laws. Like these,
it regulated the expenses of entertainments.
Extravagance in funerals, which had been
forbidden even in the Twelve Tables, was
also restrained by a law of Sulla.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aemilia</span>, proposed by the consul Aemilius
Lepidus, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 78, did not limit the expenses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
of entertainments, but the kind and quantity
of food that was to be used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antia</span>, of uncertain date, proposed by Antius
Resto, besides limiting the expenses of
entertainments, enacted that no actual magistrate,
or magistrate elect, should dine
abroad anywhere except at the houses of
certain persons. This law however was little
observed; and we are told that Antius never
dined out afterwards, that he might not see
his own law violated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>, proposed by the dictator C. Julius
Caesar, enforced the former sumptuary laws
respecting entertainments which had fallen
into disuse. He stationed officers in the
provision market to seize upon all eatables
forbidden by the law, and sometimes sent
lictors and soldiers to banquets to take everything
which was not allowed by the law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Julia</span>, a lex of Augustus, allowed 200 sesterces
to be expended upon festivals on dies
profesti, 300 on those of the calends, ides,
nones, and some other festive days, and 1000
upon marriage feasts. There was also an
edict of Augustus or Tiberius, by which as
much as from 300 to 2000 sesterces were
allowed to be expended upon entertainments,
the increase being made with the hope of securing
thereby the observance of the law.
Tiberius attempted to check extravagance in
banquets; and a senatusconsultum was passed
in his reign for the purpose of restraining
luxury, which forbade gold vases to be employed,
except for sacred purposes, and also
prohibited the use of silk garments to men.
This sumptuary law, however, was but little
observed. Some regulations on the subject
were also made by Nero and by succeeding
emperors, but they appear to have been of
little or no avail in checking the increasing
love of luxury in dress and food.</p>

<p id="Valeriae">VĂLĔRĬAE, proposed by the consul P.
Valerius Publicola, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 508, enacted, 1.
That whoever attempted to obtain possession
of royal power should be devoted to the gods,
together with his substance. 2. That
whoever was condemned by the sentence of
a magistrate to be put to death, to be
scourged, or to be fined, should possess the
right of appeal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">provocatio</i>) to the people.
The patricians possessed previously the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
of appeal from the sentence of a magistrate
to their own council the curiae, and therefore
this law of Valerius probably related only to
the plebeians, to whom it gave the right of
appeal to the plebeian tribes, and not to the
centuries. Hence the laws proposed by the
Valerian family respecting the right of appeal
are always spoken of as one of the chief
safeguards of the liberty of the plebs. The
right of appeal did not extend beyond a mile
from the city, where unlimited imperium
began, to which the patricians were just as
much subject as the plebeians.</p>

2. That whoever should procure the
election of a magistrate without appeal should
be outlawed, and might be killed by any
one with impunity. 3. Renewed the penalty
threatened against any one who should harm
the tribunes and the aediles, to whom were
now added the judices and decemviri. There

the tribune C. Curio talked of; but nothing
more seems to be known of it. Some modern
writers speak of leges viariae, but there do
not appear to be any leges properly so called.
The provisions as to roads in many of the

<p id="Villia">VILLĬA ANNĀLIS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Annalis">Lex Annalis</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Voconia">VŎCŌNIA, enacted on the proposal of
Q. Voconius Saxa, a tribunus plebis, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 169.
One provision of the lex was, that no person
who should be rated in the census at
100,000 sesterces (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centum millia aeris</i>) after
the census of that year, should make any
female (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virginem neve mulierem</i>) his heres.
The lex allowed no exceptions, even in favour
of an only daughter. It applied simply
to testaments, and therefore a daughter or
other female could inherit ab intestato to
any amount. The vestal virgins could make
women their heredes in all cases, which
was the only exception to the provisions
of the lex. Another provision of the lex
forbade a person who was included in the
census to give more in amount, in the form
of a legacy to any person, than the heres or
heredes should take. This provision secured
something to the heres or heredes, but still
the provision was ineffectual, and the object
of the lex was only accomplished by the Lex
Falcidia, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 44, which enacted that a
testator should not give more than three-fourths
in legacies, thus securing a fourth to
the heres.</p>

<p id="Libella">LĪBELLA, a small Roman silver coin,
which existed in the early age of the city.
The name was retained later as a proverbial
expression for a very small value. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libella</i> was equal in value to the old full-weight
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">as</i>; and it seems most probable that
the coin ceased being struck at the time of
the reduction of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">as</i>, on account of the
inconveniently small size which it would
have assumed. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libella</i> was subdivided
into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sembella</i>, its half, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">teruncius</i>,
its quarter. Cicero uses these words to express
fractions of an estate, with reference
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">denarius</i> as the unit, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libella</i> signifying
1-10th, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">teruncius</i> 1-40th of the
whole.</p>


<p id="Libellus">LĬBELLUS, the diminutive form of liber,
signifies properly a little book. It was
distinguished from other kinds of writings,
by being written like our books by pages,
whereas other writings were written <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transversa
charta</i>. It was used by the Romans
as a technical term in the following cases:&mdash;1.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libelli accusatorum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accusatorii</i>, the
written accusations which in some cases a
plaintiff, after having received the permission
to bring an action against a person, drew up,
signed, and sent to the judicial authorities.
2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libelli famosi</i>, libels or pasquinades, intended
to injure the character of persons.
A law of the Twelve Tables inflicted very
severe punishments on those who composed
defamatory writings. 3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libellus memorialis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
a pocket or memorandum book. 4. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libellus</i>
is used by the Roman jurists as equivalent
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oratio Principis</i>. 5. The word libellus was
also applied to a variety of writings, which in
most cases probably consisted of one page only;
such as short letters, advertisements, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p id="Liber">LĬBER (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βιβλίον</span>), a book. The most common
material on which books were written
by the Greeks and Romans, was the thin
coats or rind (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liber</i>, whence the Latin name
for a book) of the Egyptian papyrus. This
plant was called by the Egyptians Byblos
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βύβλος</span>), whence the Greeks derived their
name for a book (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βιβλίον</span>). The papyrus-tree
grows in swamps to the height of ten
feet and more, and paper (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">charta</i>) was prepared
from the thin coats or pellicles which
surround the plant. Next to the papyrus,
parchment (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">membrana</i>) was the most common
material for writing upon. It is said
to have been invented by Eumenes II. king
of Pergamus, in consequence of the prohibition
of the export of papyrus from Egypt
by Ptolemy Epiphanes. It is probable, however,
that Eumenes introduced only some
improvement in the manufacture of parchment,
as Herodotus mentions writing on
skins as common in his time, and says that
the Ionians had been accustomed to give the
name of skins (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διφθέραι</span>) to books. The ancients
wrote usually on only one side of the
paper or parchment. The back of the paper,
instead of being written upon, was usually
stained with saffron colour or the cedrus,
which produced a yellow colour. As paper
and parchment were dear, it was frequently
the custom to erase or wash out writing of
little importance, and to write upon the
paper or parchment again, which was then
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Palimpsestus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλιμψήστος</span>). The paper
or parchment was joined together so as to
form one sheet, and when the work was
finished, it was rolled on a staff, whence it
was called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">volumen</i>; and hence we have
the expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">evolvere librum</i>. When an
author divided a work into several books, it
was usual to include only one book in a
volume or roll, so that there was generally
the same number of volumes as of books. In
the papyri rolls found at Herculaneum, the
stick on which the papyrus is rolled does not
project from the papyrus, but is concealed
by it. Usually, however, there were balls
or bosses, ornamented or painted, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">umbilici</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornua</i>, which were fastened at each
end of the stick and projected from the
papyrus. The ends of the roll were carefully
cut, polished with pumice-stone and coloured
black; they were called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">geminae frontes</i>.
The way in which a book was held while
reading is shown in the following cut, taken
from a painting at Herculaneum. To protect
the roll from injury it was frequently
put into a parchment case, which was stained
with a purple colour or with the yellow of
the Lutum. The title of the book (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">titulus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">index</i>) was written on a small strip of papyrus
or parchment with a light red colour
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coccum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minium</i>).</p>

<p id="Liburna">LĬBURNA, LĬBURNĬCA, a light vessel,
which derived its name from the Liburni.
The ships of this people were of great assistance
to Augustus at the battle of Actium;
and experience having shown their efficiency,
vessels of a similar kind were built and
called by the name of the people.</p>


<p id="Lictor">LICTOR, a public officer, who attended on
the chief Roman magistrates. The number
which waited on the different magistrates is
stated in the article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Fasces">Fasces</a></span>. The office of
lictor is said to have been derived by Romulus
from the Etruscans. The lictors went
before the magistrates one by one in a line;
he who went last or next to the magistrate
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proximus lictor</i>, to whom the magistrate
gave his commands; and as this
lictor was always the principal one, we also
find him called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primus lictor</i>. The lictors
had to inflict punishment on those who were
condemned, especially in the case of Roman
citizens; for foreigners and slaves were punished
by the Carnifex; and they also probably
had to assist in some cases in the execution
of a decree or judgment in a civil suit.
The lictors likewise commanded persons to
pay proper respect to a magistrate passing
by, which consisted in dismounting from
horseback, uncovering the head, standing out
of the way, &amp;c. The lictors were originally
chosen from the plebs, but afterwards appear
to have been generally freedmen, probably of
the magistrate on whom they attended. Lictors
were properly only granted to those
magistrates who had the Imperium. Consequently,
the tribunes of the plebs never had
lictors, nor several of the other magistrates.
Sometimes, however, lictors were granted to
persons as a mark of respect or for the sake
of protection. Thus by a law of the Triumvirs
every vestal virgin was accompanied by
a lictor, whenever she went out, and the honour
of one or two lictors was usually granted
to the wives and other female members of
the Imperial family. There were also thirty
lictors called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lictores Curiati</i>, whose duty it
was to summon the curiae to the comitia
curiata; and when these meetings became
little more than a form, their suffrages were
represented by the thirty lictors.</p>


<p id="Ligula">LĬGŬLA, a Roman measure of fluid capacity,
containing one-fourth of the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Cyathus">Cyathus</a></span>.
It signifies <em>a spoonful</em>, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cochlear</i>; only the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ligula</i> was larger than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cochlear</i>. The
spoon which was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ligula</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lingula</i>
(dim. of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lingua</i>) from its shape, was used for

[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Candela">Candela</a>.</span>] A great number of ancient lamps
has come down to us; the greater part of
which are made of terra cotta, but also a
considerable number of bronze. Most of the
lamps are of an oval form, and flat upon the
top, on which there are frequently figures in
relief. In the lamps there are one or more
round holes, according to the number of
wicks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ellychnia</i>) burnt in them; and as these
holes were called from an obvious analogy,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυκτῆρες</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μύξαι</span>, literally nostrils or nozzles,

or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταβλητική</span>), wrestling. The
Greeks ascribed the invention of wrestling to
mythical personages, and Hermes, the god of
all gymnastic exercises, also presided over
wrestling. In the Homeric age wrestling
was much practised: during this period
wrestlers contended naked, and only the loins
were covered with the perizoma (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίζωμα</span>),
and this custom probably remained throughout
Greece until Ol. 15, from which time the
perizoma was no longer used, and wrestlers
contended entirely naked. In the Homeric
age the custom of anointing the body for the
purpose of wrestling does not appear to have
been known, but in the time of Solon it was
quite general, and was said to have been
adopted by the Cretans and Lacedaemonians
at a very early period. After the body was
anointed, it was strewed over with sand or dust,
in order to enable the wrestlers to take a firm
hold of each other. If one combatant threw
the other down three times, the victory was
decided. Wrestling was practised in all the
great games of the Greeks. The most renowned
wrestler was Milon, of Croton. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pancratium">Pancratium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Ludi">LŪDI, the common name for the whole
variety of games and contests which were
held at Rome on various occasions, but chiefly
at the festivals of the gods; and as the ludi
at certain festivals formed the principal part
of the solemnities, these festivals themselves
are called ludi. Sometimes ludi were also
held in honour of a magistrate or a deceased
person, in which case they may be considered
as ludi privati. All ludi were divided by the
Romans into two classes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi circenses</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi scenici</i>, accordingly as they were held in
the circus or in the theatre; in the latter
case they were mostly theatrical representations
with their various modifications; in the
former they consisted of all or of a part of the
games enumerated in the articles <span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus">Circus</a></span> and
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Gladiatores">Gladiatores</a></span>. Another division of the ludi
into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stati</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperativi</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">votivi</i>, is analogous
to the division of the feriae. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Feriae">Feriae</a>.</span>] The
superintendence of the games, and the solemnities
connected with them, was in most
cases intrusted to the aediles. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aediles">Aediles</a>.</span>]
If the lawful rites were not observed in the
celebration of the ludi, it depended upon the
decision of the pontiffs whether they were to
be held again (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">instaurari</i>) or not. An alphabetical
list of the principal ludi is subjoined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludi Apollinares</span> were instituted at Rome
during the second Punic war, after the battle
of Cannae (212 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), at the command of an
oracle contained in the books of the ancient
seer Marcius, in order to obtain the aid of
Apollo. They were held every year under
the superintendence of the praetor urbanus,
and ten men sacrificed to Apollo, according to
Greek rites, a bull with gilt horns and two
white goats also with gilt horns, and to Latona
a heifer with gilt horns. The games
themselves were held in the Circus Maximus,
the spectators were adorned with chaplets,
and each citizen gave a contribution towards
defraying the expenses. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 208, it was
ordained that they should always be celebrated
on the 6th of July.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludi Augustales.</span> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Augustales">Augustales</a>.</span>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludi Capitolini</span> were instituted <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 387,
after the departure of the Gauls from Rome,
as a token of gratitude towards Jupiter Capitolinus,
who had saved the Capitol in the
hour of danger. The superintendence of the
games was entrusted to a college of priests
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capitolini</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ludi Circenses</span>, <span class="smcap">Romani</span> or <span class="smcap">Magni</span>, were
celebrated every year during several days,
from the fourth to the twelfth of September,
in honour of the three great divinities, Jupiter,
Juno, and Minerva, or, according to
others, in honour of Jupiter, Consus, and
Neptunus Equestris. They were superintended
by the curule aediles. For further

<p><span class="smcap">Ludi Funebres</span> were games celebrated at
the funeral pyre of illustrious persons. Such
games are mentioned in the very early legends
of the history of Greece and Rome, and they
continued with various modifications until
the introduction of Christianity. It was at
such a ludus funebris, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 264, that gladiatorial
fights were exhibited at Rome for
the first time, which henceforwards were the
most essential part in all funeral games.

<p><span class="smcap">Ludi Plebeii</span> were instituted probably in
commemoration of the reconciliation between
the patricians and plebeians after the first
secession to the Mons Sacer, or, according to
others, to the Aventine. They were held on
the 16th, 17th, and 18th of November, and
were conducted by the plebeian aediles.</p>

<p id="Saeculares"><span class="smcap">Ludi Saeculares.</span> During the time of the
republic these games were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi Tarentini</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terentini</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Taurii</i>, and it was not till
the time of Augustus that they bore the name
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi saeculares</i>. The names <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tarenti</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Taurii</i> are perhaps nothing but different
forms of the same word, and of the same root
as Tarquinius. There were various accounts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]<br /><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
respecting the origin of the games, yet all
agree in stating that they were celebrated for
the purpose of averting from the state some
great calamity by which it had been afflicted,
and that they were held in honour of Dis and
Proserpina. From the time of the consul
Valerius Publicola down to that of Augustus,
the Tarentine games were held only three
times, and again only on certain emergencies,
and not at any fixed period, so that we must
conclude that their celebration was in no way
connected with certain cycles of time (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saecula</i>).
Not long after Augustus had assumed
the supreme power in the republic, the quindecimviri
announced that according to their
books <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludi saeculares</i> ought to be held, and
at the same time tried to prove from history
that in former times they had not only been
celebrated repeatedly, but almost regularly
once in every century. The festival, however,
which was now held, was in reality
very different from the ancient Tarentine
games; for Dis and Proserpina, to whom
formerly the festival belonged exclusively,
were now the last in the list of the divinities
in honour of whom the ludi saeculares were
celebrated. The festival took place in summer,
and lasted for three days and three
nights. On the first day the games commenced
in that part of the Campus Martius,
Which had belonged to the last Tarquin, from
whom it derived its name Tarentum, and
sacrifices were offered to Jupiter, Juno, Neptune,
Minerva, Venus, Apollo, Mercury, Ceres,
Vulcan, Mars, Diana, Vesta, Hercules,
Latona, the Parcae, and to Dis and Proserpina.
The solemnities began at the second
hour of the night, and the emperor opened
them by the river side with the sacrifice of
three lambs to the Parcae upon three altars
erected for the purpose, and which were
sprinkled with the blood of the victims. The
lambs themselves were burnt. A temporary
scene like that of a theatre was erected in
the Tarentum, and illuminated with lights
and fires. In this scene festive hymns were
sung by a chorus, and various other ceremonies,
together with theatrical performances,
took place. During the morning of the first
day the people went to the Capitol to offer
solemn sacrifices to Jupiter; thence they
returned to the Tarentum, to sing choruses
in honour of Apollo and Diana. On the
second day the noblest matrons, at an hour
fixed by an oracle, assembled in the Capitol,
offered supplications, sang hymns to the gods,
and also visited the altar of Juno. The emperor
and the quindecimviri offered sacrifices
which had been vowed before, to all the great
divinities. On the third day Greek and
Latin choruses were sung in the sanctuary of
Apollo by three times nine boys and maidens
of great beauty, whose parents were still
alive. The object of these hymns was to
implore the protection of the gods for all
cities, towns, and officers of the empire. One
of these hymns was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carmen saeculare</i> by
Horace, which was especially composed for
the occasion and adapted to the circumstances
of the time. During the whole of the three
days and nights, games of every description
were carried on in all the circuses and theatres,
and sacrifices were offered in all the
temples. The first celebration of the ludi
saeculares in the reign of Augustus took
place in the summer of <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 17.</p>

<p id="Lupercalia">LŬPERCĀLĬA, one of the most ancient
Roman festivals, which was celebrated every
year in honour of Lupercus, the god of fertility.
It was originally a shepherd-festival,
and hence its introduction at Rome was connected
with the names of Romulus and Remus,
the kings of shepherds. It was held
every year, on the 15th of February, in the
Lupercal, where Romulus and Remus were
said to have been nurtured by the she-wolf; the
place contained an altar and a grove sacred
to the god Lupercus. Here the Luperci assembled
on the day of the Lupercalia, and
sacrificed to the god goats and young dogs.
Two youths of noble birth were then led to
the Luperci, and one of the latter touched
their foreheads with a sword dipped in the
blood of the victims; other Luperci immediately
after wiped off the bloody spots with
wool dipped in milk. Hereupon the two
youths were obliged to break out into a shout
of laughter. This ceremony was probably
a symbolical purification of the shepherds.
After the sacrifice was over, the Luperci partook
of a meal, at which they were plentifully
supplied with wine. They then cut the
skins of the goats which they had sacrificed,
into pieces: with some of which they covered
parts of their body in imitation of the god
Lupercus, who was represented half naked
and half covered with goatskin. The other
pieces of the skins they cut in the shape of
thongs, and holding them in their hands they
ran with them through the streets of the city,
touching or striking with them all persons
whom they met in their way, and especially
women, who even used to come forward voluntarily
for the purpose, since they believed
that this ceremony rendered them fruitful,
and procured them an easy delivery in child-bearing.
This act of running about with
thongs of goatskin was a symbolic purification<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
of the land, and that of touching persons a
purification of men, for the words by which
this act is designated are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">februare</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lustrare</i>.
The goatskin itself was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">februum</i>,
the festive day <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies februata</i>, the
month in which it occurred <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Februarius</i>, and
the god himself <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Februus</i>. The festival of the
Lupercalia, though it necessarily lost its original
import at the time when the Romans were
no longer a nation of shepherds, was yet
always observed in commemoration of the
founders of the city. M. Antonius, in his
consulship, was one of the Luperci, and not
only ran with them half naked and covered
with pieces of goatskin through the city, but
even addressed the people in the forum in
this rude attire.</p>


<p id="Luperci">LŬPERCI, the priests of the god Lupercus.
They formed a college, the members of which
were originally youths of patrician families,
and which was said to have been instituted
by Romulus and Remus. The college was divided
into two classes, the one called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fabii</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fabiani</i>, and the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quinctilii</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quinctiliani</i>.
The office was not for life, but how
long it lasted is not known. Julius Caesar
added to the two classes of the college a
third with the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Julii</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juliani</i>, and
made Antonius their high-priest. He also
assigned to them certain revenues (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vectigalia</i>)
which were afterwards withdrawn from
them.</p>


<p id="Lupus">LŬPUS FERREUS, the iron wolf used by
the besieged in repelling the attacks of the

and diverting its blows.</p>


<p id="Lustratio">LUSTRĀTĬO (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάθαρσις</span>) was originally a
purification by ablution in water. But the
lustrations of which we possess direct knowledge
are always connected with sacrifices
and other religious rites, and consisted in
the sprinkling of water by means of a branch
of laurel or olive, and at Rome sometimes by
means of the aspergillum, and in the burning
of certain materials, the smoke of which was
thought to have a purifying effect. Whenever
sacrifices were offered, it seems to have
been customary to carry them around the
person or thing to be purified. Lustrations
were made in ancient Greece, and probably
at Rome also, by private individuals when
they had polluted themselves by any criminal
action. Whole cities and states also sometimes
underwent purifications to expiate the
crime or crimes committed by a member of
the community. The most celebrated purification
of this kind was that of Athens, performed
by Epimenides of Crete, after the
Cylonian massacre. Purification also took
place when a sacred spot had been unhallowed
by profane use, as by burying dead
bodies in it, as was the case with the island
of Delos. The Romans performed lustrations
on many occasions, on which the Greeks did
not think of them; and the object of most
Roman lustrations was not to atone for the
commission of crime, but to obtain the blessing
of the gods upon the persons or things
which were lustrated. Thus fields were purified
after the business of sowing was over,
and before the sickle was put to the corn.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Arvales">Arvales Fratres</a>.</span>] Sheep were purified
every year at the festival of the Palilia. All
Roman armies before they took the field were
lustrated; and as the solemnity was probably
always connected with a review of the troops,
the word lustratio is also used in the sense
of the modern review. The establishment
of a new colony was always preceded by a
lustratio with solemn sacrifices. The city of
Rome itself, as well as other towns within its
dominion, always underwent a lustratio after
they had been visited by some great calamity,
such as civil bloodshed, awful prodigies, and
the like. A regular and general lustratio of
the whole Roman people took place after the
completion of every lustrum, when the censor
had finished his census and before he laid
down his office. This lustratio (also called
lustrum) was conducted by one of the censors,
and held with sacrifices called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Suovetaurilia</i>,
because the sacrifices consisted of a pig (or
ram), a sheep, and an ox. It took place in
the Campus Martius, where the people assembled
for the purpose. The sacrifices were
carried three times around the assembled
multitude.</p>


<p id="Lustrum">LUSTRUM (from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">luo</i>, Gr. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λούω</span>) is properly
speaking a lustration or purification,
and in particular the purification of the whole
Roman people performed by one of the censors
in the Campus Martius, after the business
of the census was over. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Census">Census</a>; <a href="#Lustratio">Lustratio</a>.</span>]
As this purification took place only
once in five years, the word lustrum was also
used to designate the time between two lustra.
The first lustrum was performed in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 566, by king Servius, after he had completed
his census, and it is said to have taken
place subsequently every five years, after the
census was over. The census might be held
without the lustrum, and indeed two cases
of this kind are recorded which happened in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 459 and 214. In these cases the lustrum
was not performed on account of some
great calamities which had befallen the republic.
The time when the lustrum took
place has been very ingeniously defined by
Niebuhr. Six ancient Romulian years of 304
days each were, with the difference of one
day, equal to five solar years of 365 days
each, or the six ancient years made 1824<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
days, while the five solar years contained
1825 days. The lustrum, or the great year
of the ancient Romans, was thus a cycle, at
the end of which the beginning of the ancient
year nearly coincided with that of the
solar year. As the coincidence, however,
was not perfect, a month of 24 days was intercalated
in every eleventh lustrum. Now
it is highly probable that the recurrence of
such a cycle or great year was, from the
earliest times, solemnised with sacrifices and
purifications, and that Servius Tullius did not
introduce them, but merely connected them
with his census, and thus set the example
for subsequent ages. Many writers of the
latter period of the republic and during the
empire, use the word lustrum for any space
of five years, and without any regard to the
census, while others even apply it in the
sense of the Greek pentaeteris or an Olympiad,
which contained only four years.</p>


<p id="Lycaea">LỸCAEA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λύκαια</span>), a festival with contests,
celebrated by the Arcadians in honour of
Zeus surnamed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Λυκαῖος</span>. It was said to have
been instituted by the ancient hero Lycaon,
the son of Pelasgus, who is also said, instead
of the cakes which had formerly been offered
to the god, to have sacrificed a child to Zeus,
and to have sprinkled the altar with its
blood.</p>

<p id="Lyra">LỸRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λύρα</span>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fides</i>), a lyre, one of the
most ancient musical instruments of the
stringed kind. The Greeks attributed the
invention of the lyre to Hermes, who is said
to have formed the instrument of a tortoise-shell,
over which he placed gut-strings. The
name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λύρα</span>, however, does not occur in the
Homeric poems, and the ancient lyre, called
in Homer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phorminx</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φόρμιγξ</span>) and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">citharis</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κίθαρις</span>), seems rather to have resembled the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cithara</i> of later times, which was in some
respects like a modern guitar. In the cithara
the strings were drawn across the bottom,
whereas in the lyra of ancient times they
were free on both sides. The lyre is also
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χέλυς</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χελώνη</span>, and in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testudo</i>,
because it was made of a tortoise-shell. The
lyre had originally three or four strings, but
after the time of Terpander of Antissa (about
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 650), who is said to have added three
more, it was generally made with seven.
The ancients, however, made use of a variety
of lyres; and about the time of Sappho and
Anacreon several stringed instruments, such
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magadis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">barbiton</i>, and others, were used
in Greece, and especially in Lesbos. They
had been introduced from Asia Minor, and
their number of strings far exceeded that of
the lyre, for we know that some had even
twenty strings, so that they must have more
resembled a modern harp than a lyre. But
the lyra and cithara had in most cases no
more than seven strings. The lyre had a
great and full-sounding bottom, which continued
as before to be made generally of tortoise-shell,
from which the horns rose as from
the head of a stag. A transverse piece of
wood connecting the two horns at or near
their top-ends served to fasten the strings,
and was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζύγον</span>, and in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transtillum</i>.
The horns were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πήχεις</span> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornua</i>. These instruments were often
adorned in the most costly manner with gold
and ivory. The lyre was considered as a
more manly instrument than the cithara,
which, on account of its smaller-sounding
bottom, excluded full-sounding and deep
tones, and was more calculated for the
middle tones. The lyre when played stood
in an upright position between the knees,
while the cithara stood upon the knees of
the player. Both instruments were held
with the left hand, and played with the
right. It has generally been supposed that
the strings of these instruments were always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
touched with a little staff called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plectrum</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλῆκτρον</span>), but among the paintings discovered
at Herculaneum we find several instances
where the persons play the lyre with
their fingers. The lyre was at all times only
played as an accompaniment to songs. The
Latin name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fides</i>, which was used for a lyre
as well as a cithara, is probably the same as
the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφίδες</span>, which signifies gut-string.
The lyre (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cithara</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phorminx</i>) was at first
used in the recitations of epic poetry, though
it was probably not played during the recitation
itself, but only as a prelude before the
minstrel commenced his story, and in the
intervals or pauses between the several parts.
The lyre has given its name to a species of
poetry called lyric; this kind of poetry was
originally never recited or sung without the
accompaniment of the lyre, and sometimes
also of an appropriate dance.</p>

<p id="Maenianum" class="drop-capy">MAENIĀNUM, signified, originally, a projecting
balcony, which was erected
round the Roman forum, by the censor, C.
Maenius, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 318, in order to give more
accommodation to the spectators of the gladiatorial
combats. Hence balconies in general
came to be called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maeniana</i>.</p>

<p id="Magister">MĂGISTER., which contains the same root
as <em>mag-is</em> and <em>mag-nus</em>, was applied at Rome
to persons possessing various kinds of offices,
and especially to the leading person in a collegium
or corporation [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Collegium">Collegium</a></span>]; thus
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister societatis</i> was the president of
the corporation of equites, who farmed the
taxes at Rome.</p>

<p id="Magistratus">MĂGISTRĀTUS was a person <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui juri dicundo
praeerat</i>. The King was originally the
sole Magistratus; he had all the Potestas.
On the expulsion of the Kings, two Consuls
were annually appointed, and they were Magistratus.
In course of time other Magistratus
were appointed; namely, dictators, censors,
praetors, aediles, tribunes of the plebs,
and the decemviri litibus judicandis. The
governors of provinces with the title of propraetor
or proconsul were also Magistratus.
The word Magistratus contains the same
element as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mag(ister)</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mag(nus)</i>; and it
signifies both the person and the office, as
we see in the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">se magistratu abdicare</i>.
The auspicia maxima belonged to the consuls,
praetors, and censors, and the minora
auspicia to the other magistrates; accordingly
the consuls, praetors, and censors were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Majores</i>, and they were elected at the
comitia centuriata; the other magistratus
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minores</i>. The former had the
imperium, the latter had not. The magistratus
were also divided into curules and those
who were not curules: the magistratus curules
were the dictator, consuls, praetors,
censors, and the curule aediles, who were so
called, because they had the jus sellae curulis.
The magistrates were chosen only
from the patricians in the early republic, but
in course of time the plebeians shared these
honours, with the exception of that of the
Interrex: the plebeian magistratus, properly
so called, were the plebeian aediles and the
tribuni plebis.</p>


<p id="Majestas">MAJESTAS pretty nearly corresponds to
treason in English law; but all the offences
included under majestas comprehend more
than the English treason. One of the offences
included in majestas was the effecting, aiding
in, or planning the death of a magistratus
populi Romani, or of one who had imperium
or potestas. Though the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crimen majestatis</i>
was used, the complete expression
was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crimen laesae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imminutae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diminutae</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minutae majestatis</i>. The word majestas,
consistently with its relation to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mag(nus)</i>,
signifies the magnitude or greatness of a
thing. Accordingly, the phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">majestas
populi Romani</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperii majestas</i>, signify the
whole of that which constituted the Roman
state; in other words, the sovereign power
of the Roman state. The expression <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minuere
majestatem</i> consequently signifies any act by
which this majestas is impaired. In the republican
period the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">majestas laesa</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minuta</i> was most commonly applied to cases
of a general betraying or surrendering his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
army to the enemy, exciting sedition, and
generally by his bad conduct in administration
impairing the majestas of the state. The
old punishment of majestas was perpetual
interdiction from fire and water. In the
later imperial period, persons of low condition
were thrown to wild beasts, or burnt
alive; persons of better condition were simply
put to death. In the early times of the
republic, every act of a citizen which was
injurious to the state or its peace was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perduellio</i>, and the offender (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perduellis</i>) was
tried before the populus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">populi judicio</i>), and,
if convicted, put to death. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perduellis</i> originally
signified <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hostis</i>; and thus the old offence
of perduellio was equivalent to making war
on the Roman state. The trial for perduellio
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perduellionis judicium</i>) existed to the later
times of the republic; but the name seems to
have almost fallen into disuse, and various
leges were passed for the purpose of determining
more accurately what should be majestas.
These were a lex Apuleia, probably
passed in the fifth consulship of Marius, the
exact contents of which are unknown, a lex
Varia <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 91, a lex Cornelia passed by L.
Cornelius Sulla, and the lex Julia, which
continued under the empire to be the fundamental
enactment on this subject. This lex
Julia is by some attributed to C. Julius Caesar,
and assigned to the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 48. Under
the empire the term majestas was applied to
the person of the reigning Caesar, and we
find the phrases majestas Augusta, imperatoria,
and regia. It was, however, nothing
new to apply the term to the emperor, considered
in some of his various capacities, for it
was applied to the magistratus under the
republic, as to the consul and praetor. Horace
even addresses Augustus in the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">majestas
tua</i>, but this can hardly be viewed otherwise
than as a personal compliment, and not
as said with reference to any of the offices
which he held.</p>


<p id="Malleolus">MALLĔŎLUS, a hammer, the transverse
head of which was formed for holding pitch
and tow, which, having been set on fire, was
projected slowly, so that it might not be extinguished
during its flight, upon houses and
other buildings in order to set them on fire:
it was therefore commonly used in sieges
together with torches and falaricae.</p>


<p id="Malus">MĀLUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Navis">Navis</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Manceps">MANCEPS has the same relation to Mancipium
that Auspex has to Auspicium. It is
properly <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui manu capit</i>. But the word has
several special significations. Mancipes were
they who bid at the public lettings of the
censors for the purpose of farming any part
of the public property. Sometimes the chief
of the publicani generally are meant by this
term, as they were no doubt the bidders and
gave the security, and then they shared the
undertaking with others or underlet it. The
mancipes would accordingly have distinctive
names according to the kind of revenue which
they took on lease, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decumani</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portitores</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pecuarii</i>.</p>


<p id="Mancipatio">MANCĬPĀTĬO. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mancipium">Mancipium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Mancipium">MANCĬPĬUM, MANCĬPĀTIO. These
words are used to indicate the formal transfer
of the ownership of a thing, and are derived
from the fact that the person who received
the thing took hold of it (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipatio dicitur
quia manu res capitur</i>). It was not a simple
corporeal apprehension, but one which was
accompanied with certain forms described by
Gaius the jurist:&mdash;“Mancipatio is effected
in the presence of not less than five witnesses,
who must be Roman citizens and of
the age of puberty (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puberes</i>), and also in the
presence of another person of the same status,
who holds a pair of brazen scales, and hence
is called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libripens</i>. The purchaser (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui mancipio
accipit</i>), taking hold of the thing, says:
I affirm that this slave (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo</i>) is mine Ex
Jure Quiritium, and he is purchased by me
with this piece of money (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes</i>) and brazen
scales. He then strikes the scales with the
piece of money, and gives it to the seller as a
symbol of the price (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi pretii loco</i>).” This
mode of transfer applied to all free persons
or slaves, animals or lands, all of which persons
and things were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Res Mancipi</i>;
other things were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nec Mancipi</i>. Lands
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praedia</i>) might be thus transferred, though
the parties to the mancipatio were not on the
lands; but all other things, which were objects
of mancipatio, were only transferable in
the presence of the parties, because corporeal
apprehension was a necessary part of the
ceremony. The party who transferred the
ownership of a thing pursuant to these forms
was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipio dare</i>; he who thus acquired
the ownership was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipio accipere</i>.
The verb <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipare</i> is sometimes
used as equivalent to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipio dare</i>. Mancipium
may be used as equivalent to complete
ownership, and may thus be opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usus</i>
and to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fructus</i>. Sometimes the word mancipium
signifies a slave, as being one of the
res mancipi.</p>


<p id="Mandatum">MANDĀTUM, often signifies a command
from a superior to an inferior. Under the
empire the mandata principum were the
commands and instructions given to governors
of provinces and others.</p>

<p id="Mansio">MANSĬO <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σταθμός</span>, a post-station at the
end of a day’s journey. The word is derived
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manere</i>, signifying to pass the night at a
place in travelling. On the great Roman roads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
the mansiones were at the same distance from
one another as on those of the Persian empire,
where such resting-places (khans or caravanseras)
were first provided, viz. at intervals of
about 20 English miles. They were originally
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castra</i>, being probably mere places of encampment
formed by making earthen entrenchments.
In process of time they included, not
only barracks and magazines of provisions (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horrea</i>)
for the troops, but commodious buildings
adapted for the reception of travellers of all
ranks, and even of the emperor himself, if he
should have occasion to visit them. At those
stations the cisiarii kept gigs for hire and for
conveying government despatches. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cisium">Cisium</a>;
<a href="#Esseda">Essedum</a>.</span>] The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mansio</i> was under the superintendence
of an officer called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mansionarius</i>.</p>


<p id="Manubiae">MĂNŬBĬAE. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Spolia">Spolia</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Manumissio">MĂNŪMISSĬO was the form by which
slaves were released from slavery. There
were three modes by which this was effected,
namely, Vindicta, Census, and Testamentum.
Of these the manumissio by vindicta is probably
the oldest, and perhaps was once the
only mode of manumission. It is mentioned
by Livy as in use at an early period; and,
indeed, he states that some persons refer the
origin of the vindicta to the event which he
relates, and derive its name from Vindicius;
the latter part, at least, of the supposition is
of no value. The ceremony of the manumissio
by the vindicta was as follows:&mdash;The
master brought his slave before the magistratus,
and stated the grounds (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa</i>) of the
intended manumission. The lictor of the
magistratus laid a rod (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">festuca</i>) on the head
of the slave, accompanied with certain formal
words, in which he declared that he was a
freeman ex jure quiritium, that is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vindicavit
in libertatem</i>. The master in the meantime
held the slave, and after he had pronounced
the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hunc hominem liberum volo</i>, he
turned him round and let him go (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emisit e
manu</i>), whence the general name of the act
of manumission. The word vindicta itself,
which is properly the res <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vindicata</i>, is used
for festuca by Horace. In the case of the
census the slave was registered by the censors
as a citizen with his master’s consent. The
third mode of manumission was, when a
master gave liberty to a slave by his will
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testamentum</i>). The act of manumission
established the relation of patronus and
libertus between the manumissor and the
manumitted. When manumitted by a citizen,
the libertus took the praenomen and the gentile
name of the manumissor, and became in
a sense a member of the gens of his patron.
To these two names he added some other
name as a cognomen, either some name by
which he was previously known, or some
name assumed on the occasion: thus we find
the names M. Tullius Tiro, P. Terentius Afer,
and other like names. The relation between
a patronus and libertus is stated under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Patronus">Patronus</a></span>.
Before the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 311, the libertini
had not the suffragium, but in that year
the censor Appius Claudius gave the libertini a
place in the tribes, and from this time the
libertini had the suffragium after they were
duly admitted on the censors’ roll. In the
year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 304, they were placed in the tribus
urbanae, and not allowed to perform military
service. In the censorship of Tiberius Gracchus,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 169, they were placed in one of
the tribus urbanae, determined by lot. Subsequently,
by a law of Aemilius Scaurus,
about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 116, they were restored to the
four city tribes, and this remained their condition
to the end of the republic, though
various attempts were made to give them a
better suffrage. A tax was levied on manumission
by a lex Manlia, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 357: it consisted
of the twentieth part of the value of
the slave, hence called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vicesima</i>.</p>

<p id="Marsupium">MARSŪPĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαρσύπιον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βαλάντιον</span>), a
purse. The purse used by the ancients was
commonly a small leathern bag, and was
often closed by being drawn together at the
mouth (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύσπαστα βαλάντια</span>). Mercury is
commonly represented holding one in his
hand. (See cut, <a href="#ill063">p. 63</a>.)</p>


<p id="Martyria">MARTỸRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαρτύρια</span>), signifies strictly
the deposition of a witness in a court of justice,
though the word is applied metaphorically
to all kinds of testimony. At Athens
none but freemen could be witnesses. The
incapacity of women may be inferred from
the general policy of the Athenian law, and
the absence of any example in the orators
where a woman’s evidence is produced. The
same observation applies to minors. Slaves
were not allowed to give evidence, unless
upon examination by torture (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάσανος</span>). Citizens
who had been disfranchised (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠτιμωμένοι</span>)
could not appear as witnesses (any more than
as jurors or plaintiffs) in a court of justice;
for they had lost all honourable rights and
privileges. But there was no objection to
alien freemen. The party who desired the evidence
of a witness, summoned him to attend
for that purpose. The summons was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόσκλησις</span>. If the witness promised to
attend and failed to do so, he was liable to an
action called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη λειπομαρτυρίου</span>. Whether
he promised or not, he was bound to attend,
and if his absence caused injury to the party,
he was liable to an action (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη βλάβης</span>). The
attendance of the witness was first required
at the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκρισις</span>, where he was to make his
deposition before the superintending magistrate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><ins class="corr" id="tn-249" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'ἠγεμὼν'">
ἡγεμὼν</ins> δικαστηρίου</span>). The party in
whose favour he appeared, generally wrote
the deposition at home upon a whitened board
or tablet (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λελευκωμένον γραμματεῖον</span>), which
he brought with him to the magistrate’s
office, and, when the witness had deposed
thereto, put into the box (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐχῖνος</span>) in which
all the documents in the cause were deposited.
An oath was usually taken by the
witness at the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκρισις</span>, where he was sworn
by the opposite party at an altar. The witness,
whether he had attended before the
magistrate or not, was obliged to be present
at the trial, in order to confirm his testimony.
The only exception was, when he
was ill or out of the country, in which case
a commission might be sent to examine him.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ecmartyria">Ecmartyria</a>.</span>] All evidence was produced
by the party during his own speech, the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλεψύδρα</span> being stopped for that purpose.
The witness was called by an officer of the
court, and mounted on the raised platform
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βῆμα</span>.) of the speaker, while his deposition
was read over to him by the clerk; he then
signified his assent, either by express words,
or bowing his head in silence.&mdash;We conclude
by noticing a few expressions. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μαρτυρεῖν
τινι</span> is to testify in favour of a man, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταμαρτυρεῖν

affords some proof that testimony was not
necessarily on oath. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάρτυς</span> (witness in
the cause) is to be distinguished from the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλητὴρ</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλήτωρ</span>, who merely gave evidence
of the summons to appear.</p>

<p id="Matralia">MATRĀLĬA, a festival celebrated at Rome
every year on the 11th of June, in honour of
the goddess Mater Matuta, whose temple
stood in the Forum Boarium. It was celebrated
only by Roman matrons, and the
sacrifices offered to the goddess consisted of
cakes baked in pots of earthenware. Slaves
were not allowed to take part in the solemnities,
or to enter the temple of the goddess.
One slave, however, was admitted by the
matrons, but only to be exposed to a humiliating
treatment, for one of the matrons gave
her a blow on the cheek, and then sent her
away from the temple. The matrons on this
occasion took with them the children of their
sisters, but not their own, held them in their
arms, and prayed for their welfare.</p>

<p id="Matrimonium">MĀTRĬMŌNĬUM NUPTĬAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γάμος</span>),
marriage. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span> The ancient Greek
legislators considered the relation of marriage
as a matter not merely of private, but also of
public or general interest. This was particularly
the case at Sparta, where proceedings
might be taken against those who married
too late or unsuitably, as well as against
those who did not marry at all. But independent
of public considerations, there were
also private or personal reasons, peculiar to
the ancients, which made marriage an obligation.
One of these was the duty incumbent
upon every individual to provide for a
continuance of representatives to succeed
himself as ministers of the Divinity; and
another was the desire felt by almost every
one, not merely to perpetuate his own name,
but to leave some one who might make the
customary offerings at his grave. We are
told that with this view childless persons
sometimes adopted children. The choice of
a wife among the ancients was but rarely
grounded upon affection, and scarcely ever
could have been the result of previous acquaintance
or familiarity. In many cases a
father chose for his son a bride whom the
latter had never seen, or compelled him to
marry for the sake of checking his extravagances.
By the Athenian laws a citizen was
not allowed to marry with a foreign woman,
nor conversely, under very severe penalties,
but proximity by blood (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγχιστεία</span>), or consanguinity
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συγγένεια</span>), was not, with some
few exceptions, a bar to marriage in any
part of Greece; direct lineal descent was.
At Athens the most important preliminary
to marriage was the betrothal (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐγγύησις</span>),
which was in fact indispensable to the complete
validity of a marriage contract. It was
made by the natural or legal guardian
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ κύριος</span>) of the bride elect, and attended by
the relatives of both parties as witnesses.
The wife’s dowry was settled at the betrothal.
On the day before the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gamos</i>, or marriage,
or sometimes on the day itself, certain sacrifices
or offerings (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προτέλεια γάμων</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προγάμεια</span>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
were made to the gods who presided
over marriage. Another ceremony of almost
general observance on the wedding day, was
the bathing of both the bride and bridegroom
in water fetched from some particular fountain,
whence, as some think, the custom of
placing the figure of a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λουτροφόρος</span> or “water
carrier” over the tombs of those who died
unmarried. After these preliminaries, the
bride was generally conducted from her father’s
to the house of the bridegroom at nightfall,
in a chariot (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐφ’ ἁμάξης</span>) drawn by a pair
of males or oxen, and furnished with a kind
of couch (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλινίς</span>) as a seat. On either side of
her sat the bridegroom and one of his most
intimate friends or relations, who from his
office was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paranymph</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παράνυμφος</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νυμφευτής</span>); but as he rode in the carriage
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄχημα</span>) with the bride and bridegroom,
he was sometimes called the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάροχος</span>. The
nuptial procession was probably accompanied,
according to circumstances, by a
number of persons, some of whom carried
the nuptial torches. Both bride and bridegroom
(the former veiled) were decked out
in their best attire, with chaplets on their
heads, and the doors of their houses were
hung with festoons of ivy and bay. As
the bridal procession moved along, the
hymenaean song was sung to the accompaniment
of Lydian flutes, even in olden times,
as beautifully described by Homer, and the
married pair received the greetings and
congratulations of those who met them.
After entering the bridegroom’s house, into
which the bride was probably conducted by
his mother, bearing a lighted torch, it was
customary to shower sweetmeats upon them
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταχύσματα</span>), as emblems of plenty and
prosperity. After this came the nuptial
feast, to which the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gamos</i> was particularly
applied; it was generally given in the
house of the bridegroom or his parents; and
besides being a festive meeting, served other
and more important purposes. There was
no public rite, whether civil or religious,
connected with the celebration of marriage
amongst the ancient Greeks, and therefore
no public record of its solemnisation. This
deficiency then was supplied by the marriage
feast, for the guests were of course
competent to prove the fact of a marriage
having taken place. To this feast, contrary
to the usual practice amongst the Greeks,
women were invited as well as men; but
they seem to have sat at a separate table,
with the bride still veiled amongst them.
At the conclusion of this feast she was conducted
by her husband into the bridal
chamber; and a law of Solon required that
on entering it they should eat a quince together,
as if to indicate that their conversation
ought to be sweet and agreeable.
The song called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epithalamium</i> was then
sung before the doors of the bridal chamber.
The day after the marriage, the first of the
bride’s residence in her new abode, was
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epaulia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπαύλια</span>); on which their
friends sent the customary presents to the
newly married couple. On another day,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apaulia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπαύλια</span>), perhaps the second
after marriage, the bridegroom left his house,
to lodge apart from his wife at his father’s-in-law.
Some of the presents made to the
bride by her husband and friends were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anacalypteria</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνακαλυπτήρια</span>), as being given
on the occasion of the bride first appearing
unveiled: they were probably given on the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epaulia</i>, or day after the marriage. Another
ceremony observed after marriage was the
sacrifice which the husband offered up on
the occasion of his bride being registered
amongst his own phratores. The above account
refers to Athenian customs.&mdash;At Sparta
the betrothal of the bride by her father or
guardian (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύριος</span>) was requisite as a preliminary
of marriage, as well as at Athens.
Another custom peculiar to the Spartans,
and a relic of ancient times, was the seizure
of the bride by her intended husband, but of
course with the sanction of her parents or
guardians. She was not, however, immediately
domiciled in her husband’s house,
but cohabited with him for some time clandestinely,
till he brought her, and frequently
her mother also, to his home.&mdash;The Greeks,
generally speaking, entertained little regard
for the female character. They considered
women, in fact, as decidedly inferior to men,
qualified to discharge only the subordinate
functions in life, and rather necessary as
helpmates than agreeable as companions.
To these notions female education for the
most part corresponded, and in fact confirmed
them; it did not supply the elegant
accomplishments and refinement of manners
which permanently engage the affections,
when other attractions have passed away.
Aristotle states, that the relation of man to
woman is that of the governor to the subject;
and Plato, that a woman’s virtue may
be summed up in a few words, for she has
only to manage the house well, keeping what
there is in it, and obeying her husband.
Among the Dorians, however, and especially
at Sparta, women enjoyed much more estimation
than in the rest of Greece.&mdash;(2) <span id="Matr_r" class="smcap">Roman.</span>
A legal Roman marriage was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">justae nuptiae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">justum matrimonium</i>, as being
conformable to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civile</i>) or to law. A legal
marriage was either <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum conventione uxoris
in manum viri</i> or it was without <ins class="corr" id="tn-250" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'this conventio.'">
this convention.</ins> But both forms of marriage agreed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
in this: there must be connubium between
the parties, and consent. The legal consequences
as to the power of the father over
his children were the same in both. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Connubium</i>
is merely a term which comprehends
all the conditions of a legal marriage. Generally
it may be stated, that there was only
connubium between Roman citizens; the
cases in which it at any time existed between
parties, not both Roman citizens, were exceptions
to the general rule. Originally, or
at least at one period of the republic, there
was no connubium between the patricians
and the plebeians; but this was altered by
the Lex Canuleia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 445.), which allowed
connubium between persons of those two
classes. There were various degrees of consanguinity
and affinity, within which there
was no connubium. An illegal union of a
male and female, though affecting to be, was
not a marriage: the man had no legal wife,
and the children had no legal father: consequently
they were not in the power of their
reputed father. The marriage <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum conventione</i>
differed from that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sine conventione</i>, in
the relationship which it effected between the
husband and the wife; the marriage <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum
conventione</i> was a necessary condition to
make a woman a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">materfamilias</i>. By the
marriage cum conventione, the wife passed
into the familia of her husband, and was to
him in the relation of a daughter, or, as it
was expressed, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in manum convenit</i>. In the
marriage sine conventione, the wife’s relation
to her own familia remained as before,
and she was merely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uxor</i>. “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Uxor</i>,” says
Cicero, “is a genus of which there are two
species; one is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">materfamilias, quae in manum
convenit</i>; the other is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uxor</i> only.” Accordingly,
a materfamilias is a wife who is in
manu, and in the familia of her husband. A
wife not in manu was not a member of her
husband’s familia, and therefore the term
could not apply to her. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Matrona</i> was properly
a wife not in manu, and equivalent to
uxor; and she was called matrona before she
had any children. But these words are not
always used in these their original and
proper meanings. It does not appear that
any forms were requisite in the marriage
sine conventione; and apparently the evidence
of such marriage was cohabitation matrimonii
causa. The matrimonii causa might
be proved by various kinds of evidence. In
the case of a marriage cum conventione,
there were three forms, 1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Usus</i>, 2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Farreum</i>,
and 3. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coemptio</i>.&mdash;1. Marriage was
effected by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usus</i>, if a woman lived with a
man for a whole year as his wife; and this
was by analogy to usucaption of movables
generally, in which usus for one year gave
ownership. The Law of the Twelve Tables provided,
that if a woman did not wish to come
into the manus of her husband in this manner,
she should absent herself from him
annually for three nights (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trinoctium</i>) and so
break the usus of the year. 2. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Farreum</i> was
a form of marriage, in which certain words
were used in the presence of ten witnesses,
and were accompanied by a certain religious
ceremony, in which panis farreus was employed;
and hence this form of marriage was
also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">confarreatio</i>. It appears that
certain priestly offices, such as that of Flamen
Dialis, could only be held by those who
were born of parents who had been married
by this ceremony (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">confarreati parentes</i>). 3.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coemptio</i> was effected by mancipatio, and
consequently the wife was in mancipio.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mancipium">Mancipium</a>.</span>] A woman who was cohabiting
with a man as uxor, might come into his
manus by this ceremony, in which case the
coemptio was said to be matrimonii causa,
and she who was formerly uxor became
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apud maritum filiae loco</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sponsalia</i> were
not an unusual preliminary of marriage, but
they were not necessary.&mdash;The sponsalia were
an agreement to marry, made in such form
as to give each party a right of action
in case of non-performance, and the offending
party was condemned in such damages
as to the judex seemed just. The woman
who was promised in marriage was accordingly
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sponsa</i>, which is equivalent to
promissa; the man who was engaged to
marry was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sponsus</i>.&mdash;The sponsalia
were of course not binding, if the parties
consented to waive the contract. Sometimes
a present was made by the future husband to
the future wife by way of earnest (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arrha</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arrha sponsalitia</i>), or, as it was called, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propter
nuptias donatio</i>.&mdash;The consequences of
marriage were&mdash;1. The power of the father
over the children of the marriage, which was
a completely new relation, an effect indeed
of marriage, but one which had no influence
over the relation of the husband and wife.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Patria">Patria Potestas</a>.</span>] 2. The liabilities of
either of the parties to the punishments
affixed to the violation of the marriage union.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Adulterium">Adulterium</a>; <a href="#Divortium">Divortium</a>.</span>] 3. The relation
of husband and wife with respect to property.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Dos">Dos</a>.</span>] When marriage was dissolved, the
parties to it might marry again; but opinion
considered it more decent for a woman not
to marry again. A woman was required by
usage (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mos</i>) to wait a year before she contracted
a second marriage, on the pain of
infamia.&mdash;It remains to describe the customs
and rites which were observed by the Romans
at marriages. After the parties had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
agreed to marry and the persons in whose
potestas they were had consented, a meeting
of friends was sometimes held at the house
of the maiden for the purpose of settling the
marriage-contract, which was written on
tablets, and signed by both parties. The
woman after she had promised to become
the wife of a man was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sponsa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pacta</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicta</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sperata</i>. It appears that, at least
during the imperial period, the man put a
ring on the finger of his betrothed, as a
pledge of his fidelity. This ring was probably,
like all rings at this time, worn on
the left hand, and on the finger nearest to
the smallest. The last point to be fixed was
the day on which the marriage was to take
place. The Romans believed that certain
days were unfortunate for the performance
of the marriage rites, either on account of
the religious character of those days themselves,
or on account of the days by which
they were followed, as the woman had to
perform certain religious rites on the day
after her wedding, which could not take
place on a dies ater. Days not suitable for
entering upon matrimony were the calends,
nones, and ides of every month, all dies atri,
the whole months of May and February, and
a great number of festivals. On the wedding-day,
which in the early times was never
fixed upon without consulting the auspices,
the bride was dressed in a long white robe
with a purple fringe, or adorned with ribands.
This dress was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tunica recta</i>, and was
bound round the waist with a girdle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corona</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cingulum</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">zona</i>), which the husband had
to untie in the evening. The bridal veil,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flammeum</i>, was of a bright yellow
colour, and her shoes likewise. Her hair
was divided on this occasion with the point
of a spear. The bride was conducted to the
house of her husband in the evening. She
was taken with apparent violence from the
arms of her mother, or of the person who
had to give her away. On her way she was
accompanied by three boys dressed in the
praetexta, and whose fathers and mothers
were still alive (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patrimi et matrimi</i>). One
of them carried before her a torch of white
thorn (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spina</i>), or, according to others, of
pine wood; the two others walked by her
side, supporting her by the arm. The bride
herself carried a distaff and a spindle, with
wool. A boy called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">camillus</i> carried in a
covered vase (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cumera</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cumerum</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">camillum</i>),
the so-called utensils of the bride and
playthings for children (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crepundia</i>). Besides
these persons who officiated on the occasion,
the procession was attended by a numerous
train of friends, both of the bride and the
bridegroom. When the procession arrived
at the house of the bridegroom, the door of
which was adorned with garlands and flowers,
the bride was carried across the threshold by
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pronubi</i>, <em>i.e.</em> men who had been married
to only one woman, that she might not
knock against it with her foot, which would
have been an evil omen. Before she entered
the house, she wound wool around the door-posts
of her new residence, and anointed
them with lard (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adeps suillus</i>) or wolf’s fat
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adeps lupinus</i>). The husband received her
with fire and water, which the woman had
to touch. This was either a symbolic purification,
or a symbolic expression of welcome,
as the interdicere aqua et igni was the formula
for banishment. The bride saluted her
husband with the words: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi tu Caius, ego
Caia</i>. After she had entered the house with
distaff and spindle, she was placed upon a
sheep-skin, and here the keys of the house
were delivered into her hands. A repast
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coena nuptialis</i>) given by the husband to
the whole train of relatives and friends who
accompanied the bride, generally concluded
the solemnity of the day. Many ancient
writers mention a very popular song, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Talasius</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Talassio</i>, which was sung at weddings;
but whether it was sung during the
repast or during the procession is not quite
clear, though we may infer from the story
respecting the origin of the song, that it was
sung while the procession was advancing
towards the house of the husband. It may
easily be imagined that a solemnity like that
of marriage did not take place among the
merry and humorous Italians without a
variety of jests and railleries, and the ancient
writers mention songs which were sung before
the door of the bridal apartment by girls,
after the company had left. These songs
were probably the old Fescennina [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fescennina">Fescennina</a></span>],
and are frequently called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epithalamia</i>.
At the end of the repast the bride was conducted
by matrons who had not had more
than one husband (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pronubae</i>), to the lectus
genialis in the atrium, which was on this
occasion magnificently adorned and strewed
with flowers. On the following day the
husband sometimes gave another entertainment
to his friends, which was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repotia</i>,
and the woman, who on this day undertook
the management of the house of her husband,
had to perform certain religious rites;
on which account, as was observed above, it
was necessary to select a day for the marriage
which was not followed by a dies ater.
These rites probably consisted of sacrifices to
the Dii Penates. The position of a Roman
woman after marriage was very different
from that of a Greek woman. The Roman
presided over the whole household; she educated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
her children, watched over and preserved
the honour of the house, and as the
materfamilias she shared the honours and
respect shown to her husband. Far from
being confined like the Greek women to a
distinct apartment, the Roman matron, at
least during the better centuries of the republic,
occupied the most important part of
the house, the atrium.</p>


<p id="Mausoleum">MAUSŌLĒUM <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μαυσωλεῖον</span>, signified originally
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">the sepulchre of Mausolus</i>, which was
a magnificent monument erected at Halicarnassus
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 353, by Artemisia, the widow of
Mausolus. (See <cite>Classical Dict., art. Artemisia</cite>.)
It was adorned with beautiful works
of art, and was regarded as one of the seven
wonders of the world. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mausoleum</i>
was used by the Romans as a generic name
for any magnificent sepulchral edifice. Mausolus,
the dynast of Caria, having died in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 353, his queen Artemisia evinced her
sorrow by observing his funeral rites with
the most expensive splendour, and by commencing
the erection of a sepulchral monument
to him at Halicarnassus, which should
surpass any thing the world had yet seen.
The building extended 63 feet from north to
south, being shorter on the fronts, and its
whole circuit was 411 feet (or, according to
the Bamberg MS., 440); it rose to the height
of 25 cubits (37½ feet); and was surrounded
by 36 columns. This part of the building was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pteron</i>. It was adorned with sculptures
in relief, on its eastern face by Scopas, on the
northern by Bryaxis, on the southern by
Timotheus, on the western by Leochares.
Above this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pteron</i> was a pyramid equal to it
in height, diminishing by 24 steps to its
summit, which was surmounted by the marble
quadriga made by Pythis. The total
height, including this ornament, was 140
feet. In the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mausolea</i> the form
chiefly employed was that of a succession of
terraces in imitation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogus</i>. Of these
the most celebrated were those of Augustus
and of Hadrian; the latter of which, stripped
of its ornaments, still forms the fortress of
modern Rome (the castle of S. Angelo); but
of the other, which was on a still larger
scale, and which was considered as one
of the most magnificent buildings of Augustus,

<p id="Mediastini">MĔDĬASTĪNI, the name given to slaves,
used for any common purpose. The name is
chiefly given to certain slaves belonging to
the familia rustica, but it is also applied sometimes
to slaves in the city.</p>


<p id="Medimnus">MĔDIMNUS <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέδιμνος</span>, the principal dry
measure of the Greeks. It was used especially
for measuring corn. The Attic medimnus
was equal to six Roman modii. For its
subdivisions see <a href="#TABLES">Tables</a> at the end. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Metretes">Metretes</a></span>;

<p id="Medix">MĒDIX TUTICUS, the name of the supreme
magistrate among the Oscan people.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Medix</i> appears to have signified a magistrate
of any kind, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuticus</i> to have been equivalent
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summus</i>. Livy, therefore,
in calling the medix tuticus the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summus magistratus</i>,
gives a literal translation of the word.</p>


<p id="Megalesia">MĔGĂLĒSĬA, MĔGĂLENSĬA, or MĔGĂLENSES
LŪDI, a festival with games, celebrated
at Rome in the month of April and in
honour of the great mother of the gods
(Cybelé, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεγάλη θεός</span>, whence the festival
derived its name). The statue of the goddess
was brought to Rome from Pessinus in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
203, and the day of its arrival was solemnised
with a magnificent procession, lectisternia,
and games, and great numbers of people carried
presents to the goddess on the Capitol.
The regular celebration of the Megalesia,
however, did not begin till twelve years later
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 191), when the temple, which had been
vowed and ordered to be built in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 203,
was completed and dedicated by M. Junius
Brutus. The festival lasted for six days,
beginning on the 4th of April. The season of
this festival, like that of the whole month in
which it took place, was full of general rejoicings
and feasting. It was customary for
the wealthy Romans on this occasion to invite
one another mutually to their repasts.
The games which were held at the Megalesia
were purely scenic, and not circenses. They
were at first held on the Palatine, in front of
the temple of the goddess, but afterwards
also in the theatres. The day which was
especially set apart for the performance of
scenic plays was the third of the festival.
Slaves were not permitted to be present at
the games, and the magistrates appeared
dressed in a purple toga and praetexta,
whence the proverb, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpura Megalensis</i>.
The games were under the superintendence
of the curule aediles, and we know that four
of the extant plays of Terence were performed
at the Megalesia.</p>

<p id="Mensa">MENSA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τράπεζα</span>), a table. The simplest
kind of table was a round one with three
legs, called in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίπους</span>. Tables, however,
must usually have had four legs, as the
etymology of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τράπεζα</span>, the common word for
table, indicates. For the houses of the opulent,
tables were made of the most valuable
and beautiful kinds of wood, especially of
maple, or of the citrus of Africa, which was
a species of cypress or juniper. As the table
was not large, it was usual to place the dishes
and the various kinds of meat upon it, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
then to bring it thus furnished to the place
where the guests were reclining. On many
occasions, indeed, each guest either had a
small table to himself, or the company was
divided into parties of two or three, with a
separate table for each party, as is distinctly
represented in the cut under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Symposium">Symposium</a></span>.
Hence we have such phrases as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensam apponere</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opponere</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensam auferre</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">removere</i>. The two principal courses of a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deipnon</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coena</i>, or a Greek and Roman
dinner, were called respectively <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρώτη τράπεζα</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεύτερα τράπεζα</span>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensa prima</i>,

<p id="Mensarii">MENSĀRĬI, MENSŬLĀRĬI, or NŪMŬLĀRĬI,
a kind of public bankers at Rome
who were appointed by the state; they were
distinct from the argentarii, who were common
bankers, and did business on their own
account. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Argentarii">Argentarii</a>.</span>] The mensarii had
their tables or banks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensae</i>) like ordinary
bankers, in the forum, and in the name of
the aerarium they offered ready money to
debtors who could give security to the state
for it. Such an expediency was devised by
the state only in times of great distress. The
first time that mensarii (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinqueviri mensarii</i>)
were appointed was in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 352, at the time
when the plebeians were so deeply involved
in debt, that they were obliged to borrow
money from new creditors in order to pay
the old ones, and thus ruined themselves
completely. On this occasion they were also
authorised to ordain that cattle or land should
be received as payment at a fair valuation.
With the exception of this first time, they
appear during the time of the republic to
have always been <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triumviri mensarii</i>. One
class of mensarii, however (perhaps an inferior
order), the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mensularii</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">numularii</i>,
seem to have been permanently employed by
the state, and these must be meant when we
read, that not only the aerarium, but also
private individuals, deposited in their hands
sums of money which they had to dispose of.</p>

<p id="Metallum">MĔTALLUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέταλλον</span>), a <em>mine</em> and <em>metal</em>.
The metals which have been known from the
earliest period of which we have any information
are those which were long distinguished
as the seven principal metals, namely, gold,
silver, copper, tin, iron, lead, and mercury.
If to this list we add the compound of gold
and silver called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">electrum</i>, the compound of
copper and tin called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χαλκός</span> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes</i> (bronze),
and steel, we have, in all probability, a complete
list of the metals known to the Greeks
and Romans, with the exception of zinc,
which they do not seem to have known as a
metal, but only in its ores, and of brass,
which, they regarded as a sort of bronze. The
early Greeks were no doubt chiefly indebted
for a supply of the various metals to the
commerce of the Phoenicians, who procured
them principally from Arabia and Spain, and
tin from our own island and the East. They
were perfectly acquainted with the processes
of smelting the metal from the ore, and of
forging heated masses into the required
shapes, by the aid of the hammer and tongs.
The smith’s instruments were the anvil
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκμων</span>) with the block on which it rested
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκμόθετον</span>), the tongs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυράγρη</span>) and the
hammer (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥαιστήρ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφῦρα</span>). The advances
made in the art of metallurgy in subsequent
times are chiefly connected with the
improvements in the art of statuary. The
method of working, as described in Homer,
seems to have long prevailed, namely by
beating out lumps of the material into the
form proposed, and afterwards fitting the
pieces together by means of pins or keys.
It was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφυρήλατον</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφῦρα</span>, a
hammer. The next mode, among the Greeks,
of executing metal works seems to have
been by plating upon a nucleus, or general
form, of wood&mdash;a practice which was employed
also by the Egyptians. It is extremely
difficult to determine at what date
the casting of metal was introduced. According
to the statements of Pausanias and
Pliny, the art of casting in bronze and in
iron was invented by Rhoecus and Theodorus
of Samos, who probably lived in the sixth
and fifth centuries before our era.</p>


<p id="Metoici">MĔTOICI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέτοικοι</span>), the name by which,
at Athens and in other Greek states, the
<em>resident aliens</em> were designated. They must
be distinguished from such strangers as made
only a transitory stay in a place, for it was a
characteristic of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metoicus</i>, that he resided
permanently in the city. No city of Greece
perhaps had such a number of resident aliens
as Athens, since none afforded to strangers so
many facilities for carrying on mercantile
business, or a more agreeable mode of living.
In the census instituted by Demetrius Phalereus
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 309), the number of resident aliens
at Athens was 10,000, in which number
women and children were probably not included.
The jealousy with which the citizens
of the ancient Greek republics kept their
body clear of intruders, is also manifest in
their regulations concerning aliens. However
long they might have resided in Athens,
they were always regarded as strangers,
whence they are sometimes called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξένοι</span>, and
to remind them of their position, they had on
some occasions to perform certain degrading
services for the Athenian citizens [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Hydriaphoria">Hydriaphoria</a></span>].<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
These services were, however, in
all probability not intended to hurt the feelings
of the aliens, but were simply acts symbolical
of their relation to the citizens. Aliens
were not allowed to acquire landed property
in the state they had chosen for their residence,
and were consequently obliged to live
in hired houses or apartments. As they did
not constitute a part of the state, and were
yet in constant intercourse and commerce with
its members, every alien was obliged to select
a citizen for his patron (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάτης</span>), who was
not only the mediator between them and the
state, through whom alone they could transact
any legal business, whether private or
public, but was at the same time answerable
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐγγυητής</span>) to the state for the conduct of his
client. On the other hand, however, the
state allowed the aliens to carry on all kinds
of industry and commerce under the protection
of the law; in fact, at Athens nearly all
business was in the hands of aliens, who on
this account lived for the most part in the
Peiraeeus. Each family of aliens, whether
they availed themselves of the privilege of
carrying on any mercantile business or not,
had to pay an annual tax (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετοίκιον</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενικά</span>)
of twelve drachmae, or if the head of the
family was a widow, of only six drachmae.
If aliens did not pay this tax, or if they
assumed the right of citizens, and probably
also in case they refused to select a patron,
they not only forfeited the protection of the
state, but were sold as slaves. Extraordinary
taxes and liturgies (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφοραί</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λειτουργίαι</span>)
devolved upon aliens no less than upon citizens.
The aliens were also obliged, like
citizens, to serve in the regular armies and
in the fleet, both abroad and at home, for the
defence of the city. Those aliens who were
exempt from the burthens peculiar to their
class were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">isoteles</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰσοτελεῖς</span>). They
had not to pay the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετοίκιον</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτέλια μετοικίου</span>),
were not obliged to choose a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάτης</span>,
and in fact enjoyed all the rights of citizens,
except those of a political nature. Their condition
was termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰσοτέλεια</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἰσοπολιτεία</span>.</p>


<p id="Metopa">MĔTOPA or MĔTŎPE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετόπη</span>), the name
applied to each of the spaces between the
triglyphs in the frieze of the Doric order, and
by metonymy to the sculptured ornament
with which those spaces were filled up. In
the original significance of the parts the triglyphs
represent the ends of the cross-beams
or joists which rested on the architrave; the
beds of these beams were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπαί</span>, and
hence the spaces between them <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετόπαι</span>.
Originally they were left open; next they
were filled up with plain slabs, as in the
propylaea at Eleusis, and many other buildings,
and lastly, but still at an early period,
they were adorned with sculptures either in
low or high relief. The metopes from the
Parthenon in the British Museum are
adorned with sculptures in high relief.</p>


<p id="Metretes">MĔTRĒTES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετρητής</span>), the principal Greek
liquid measure. The Attic metretes was equal
in capacity to the amphora, containing 8
galls. 7·365 pints, English. See the <a href="#TABLES">Tables</a>.

<p id="Miliare">MĬLIĀRE, MILLĬĀRĬUM, or MILLE
PASSUUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίλιον</span>), the Roman mile, consisted
of 1000 paces (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">passus</i>) of 5 feet each,
and was therefore = 5000 feet. Taking the
Roman foot at 11·6496 English inches [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pes">Pes</a></span>],
the Roman mile would be 1618 English
yards, or 142 yards less than the English
statute mile. The most common term for
the mile is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mille passuum</i>, or only the initials
M. P.; sometimes the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">passuum</i> is omitted.
The Roman mile contained 8 Greek
stadia. The mile-stones along the Roman
roads were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">milliaria</i>. They were also
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapides</i>; thus we have <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad tertium lapidem</i>
(or without the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lapidem</i>) for 3
miles from Rome. Augustus erected a gilt
pillar in the Forum, where the principal
roads terminated, which was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">milliarium
aureum</i>; but the miles were not
reckoned from it, but from the gates of the
city. Such central marks appear to have
been common in the principal cities of the
Roman empire. The “London-stone” in
Cannon-street is supposed to have marked
the centre of the Roman roads in Britain.</p>


<p id="Mimus">MĪMUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μῖμος</span>), the name by which, in
Greece and at Rome, a species of the drama
was designated, though the Roman mimus
differed essentially from the Greek. The
Greek mimus seems to have originated among
the Greeks of Sicily and southern Italy, and
to have consisted originally of extemporary
representations or imitations of ridiculous
occurrences of common life at certain festivals.
At a later period these rude representations
acquired a more artistic form,
which was brought to a high degree of perfection
by Sophron of Syracuse (about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
420). He wrote his pieces in the popular
dialect of the Dorians and a kind of rhythmical
prose. Among the Romans the word
mimus was applied to a species of dramatic
plays as well as to the persons who acted in
them. It is certain that the Romans did not
derive their mimus from the Greeks in
southern Italy, but that it was of native
growth. The Greek mimes were written in
prose, and the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μῖμος</span> was never applied
to an actor, but if used of a person it signified
one who made grimaces. The Roman mimes
were imitations of foolish and mostly indecent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
occurrences, and scarcely differed from
comedy except in consisting more of gestures
and mimicry than of spoken dialogue. At
Rome such mimes seem originally to have been
exhibited at funerals, where one or more persons
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mimi</i>) represented in a burlesque manner
the life of the deceased. If there were several
mimi, one of them, or their leader, was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">archimimus</i>. These coarse and indecent performances
had greater charms for the Romans
than the regular drama. They were performed
on the stage as farces after tragedies, and
during the empire they gradually supplanted
the place of the Atellanae. It was peculiar to
the actors in these mimes, to wear neither
masks, the cothurnus, nor the soccus, whence
they are sometimes called planipedes.</p>

A broad band of cloth worn round the

<p id="Modius">MODĬUS, the principal dry measure of
the Romans, was equal to one-third of the
amphora, and therefore contained nearly two
gallons English. (See the <a href="#TABLES">Tables</a>.) The
modius was one-sixth of the medimnus.</p>


<p id="Mola">MŎLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μύλος</span>), a mill. All mills were anciently
made of stone, the kind used being a
volcanic trachyte or porous lava (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pyrites</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silices</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pumiceas</i>). Every mill consisted of
two essential parts, the upper mill-stone,
which was moveable (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">catillus</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄνος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἐπιμύλιον</span>),
and the lower, which was fixed and
by much the larger of the two. Hence a
mill is sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">molae</i> in the plural.
The principal mills mentioned by ancient
authors are the following:&mdash;I. The hand-mill,
or quern, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mola manuaria, versatilis</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trusatilis</i>. The hand-mills were
worked among the Greeks and Romans by
slaves. Their pistrinum was consequently
proverbial as a place of painful and degrading
labour; and this toil was imposed principally
on women. II. The cattle-mill, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mola asinaria</i>,
in which human labour was supplied by
the use of an ass or some other animal. III.
The water-mill (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mola aquaria</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑδραλέτης</span>).
A cogged wheel, attached to the axis of the
water wheel, turned another which was attached
to the axis of the upper mill-stone:
the corn to be ground fell between the stones
out of a hopper (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infundibulum</i>), which was
fixed above them. IV. The floating-mill.
V. The saw-mill. VI. The pepper-mill.</p>


<p id="Monarchia">MŎNARCHĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοναρχία</span>), a general name
for any form of government in which the supreme
functions of political administration
are in the hands of a single person. The
term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοναρχία</span> is applied to such governments,
whether they are hereditary or elective, legal
or usurped. In its commonest application,
it is equivalent to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεία</span>, whether absolute
or limited. But the rule of an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aesymnetes</i>
or a <em>tyrant</em> would equally be called a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μοναρχία</span>.
Hence Plutarch uses it to express the Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dictatura</i>. It is by a somewhat rhetorical
use of the word that it is applied now and
then to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</span>.</p>


<p id="Moneta">MŎNĒTA, the mint, or the place where
money was coined. The mint of Rome was
a building on the Capitoline, and attached to
the temple of Juno Moneta, as the aerarium
was to the temple of Saturn. The officers
who had the superintendence of the mint
were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triumviri Monetales</i>, who were
perhaps first appointed about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 269.
Under the republic, the coining of money
was not a privilege which belonged exclusively
to the state. The coins struck in the
time of the republic mostly bear the names
of private individuals; and it would seem
that every Roman citizen had the right of
having his own gold and silver coined in the
public mint, and under the superintendence
of its officers. Still no one till the time of
the empire had the right of putting his own
image upon a coin; Julius Caesar was the
first to whom this privilege was granted.</p>


<p id="Monile">MŎNĪLE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅρμος</span>), a necklace. Necklaces
were worn by both sexes among the most polished
of those nations which the Greeks called
barbarous, especially the Indians, the Egyptians,
and the Persians. Greek and Roman
females adopted them more particularly as a
bridal ornament. They were of various forms,
as may be seen by the following specimens:&mdash;</p>

(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄλμος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴγδη</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴγδις</span>), a mortar. Before
the invention of mills [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mola">Mola</a></span>] corn was
pounded and rubbed in mortars (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pistum</i>),
and hence the place for making bread, or the
bake-house, was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pistrinum</i>. Also long
after the introduction of mills this was an
indispensable article of domestic furniture.
Those used in pharmacy were sometimes
made of Egyptian alabaster. The mortar
was also employed in pounding charcoal, rubbing
it with glue, in order to make black
paint (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atramentum</i>), in making plaster for
the walls of apartments, in mixing spices and
fragrant herbs and flowers for the use of the

<p id="Murrhina">MURRHĬNA VĀSA, or MURRĔA VĀSA,
were first introduced into Rome by Pompey,
who dedicated cups of this kind to Jupiter
Capitolinus. Their value was very great.
Nero gave 300 talents for a capis or drinking
cup. These murrhine vessels came from the
East, principally from places within the Parthian
empire, and chiefly from Caramania.
They were made of a substance formed by a
moisture thickened in the earth by heat, and
were chiefly valued on account of the variety
of their colours. Modern writers differ much
respecting the material of which they were
composed, and some think they may have
been true Chinese porcelain.</p>


<p id="Murus">MŪRUS, MOENĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τεῖχος</span>), the wall of a
city, in contradistinction to <span class="smcap"><a href="#Paries">Paries</a></span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοῖχος</span>),
the wall of a house, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maceria</i>, a boundary
wall. We find cities surrounded by massive
walls at the earliest periods of Greek and
Roman history. Homer speaks of the chief
cities of the Argive kingdom as “the walled
Tiryns,” and “Mycenae the well-built city,”
attesting the great antiquity of those identical
gigantic walls which still stand at Tiryns and
Mycenae, and which have been frequently attributed
to the Cyclopes and Pelasgians. Three
principal species can be clearly distinguished:&mdash;1.
That in which the masses of
stone are of irregular shape and are put together
without any attempt to fit them into
one another, the interstices being loosely
filled in with smaller stones. An example is
given in the annexed engraving.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/ill257a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Ancient Wall at Tiryns.</div>
</div>

<p>2. In other cases we find the blocks still of irregular
polygonal shapes, but their sides are sufficiently
smoothed to make each fit accurately
into the angles between the others, and their
faces are cut so as to give the whole wall a
tolerably smooth surface. An example is given
in the annexed engraving.</p>

  <div class="caption">Ancient Wall of Larissa, the Acropolis of Argos.</div>
</div>

<p>3. In the third species,
the blocks are laid in horizontal courses,
more or less regular (sometimes indeed so
irregular, that none of the horizontal joints
are continuous), and with vertical joints
either perpendicular or oblique, and with all
the joints more or less accurately fitted. The
walls of Mycenae present one of the ruder
examples of this sort of structure; and the
following engraving of the “Lion Gate” of
that fortress (so called from the rudely sculptured
figures of lions) shows also the manner
in which the gates of these three species of
walls were built, by supporting an immense
block of stone, for the lintel, upon two others,
for jambs, the latter inclining inwards, so as
to give more space than if they were upright.&mdash;</p>

<p>The materials employed in walls
about the time of Pericles were various sorts
of stone, and, in some of the most magnificent
temples, marble. The practice of putting
a facing of marble over a wall of a commoner
material was introduced in the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
period of architectural history. For buildings
of a common sort, the materials employed
were smaller stones, rough or squared,
or flints, as well as bricks. These were
bound together with various kinds of mortar
or cement, composed of lime mixed with different
sands and volcanic earths. The history
of Roman masonry is not very different from
that of the Greek.&mdash;The most ancient works
at Rome, such as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carcer Mamertinus</i>,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cloaca Maxima</i>, and the Servian Walls,
were constructed of massive quadrangular
hewn stones, placed together without cement.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cloaca">Cloaca</a>.</span>] Five species of Roman masonry
may be distinguished; namely, 1. when
the blocks of stone are laid in alternate
courses, lengthwise in one course, and crosswise
in the next; this is the most common;
2. when the stones in each course are laid
alternately along and across; this construction
was usual when the walls were to
be faced with slabs of marble; 3. when they
are laid entirely lengthwise; 4. entirely
crosswise; and 5. when the courses are alternately
higher and lower than each other.
As by the Greeks, so by the Romans, walls
of a commoner sort were built of smaller
quarried stones (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caementa</i>) or of bricks. The
excellence of the cement which the Romans
used enabled them to construct walls of very
small rough stones, not laid in courses, but
held together by the mortar; this structure
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opus incertum</i>. Another structure
of which the Romans made great use, and
which was one of the most durable of all,
was that composed of courses of flat tiles.
Such courses were also introduced in the
other kinds of stone and brick walls, in which
they both served as bond-courses, and, in the
lower part of the wall, kept the damp from
rising from the ground. Brick walls covered
with stucco were exceedingly common with
the Romans: even columns were made of
brick covered with stucco.</p>


<p id="Musculus">MUSCŬLUS was a kind of vinea, one of
the smaller military machines, by which the
besiegers of a town were protected.</p>


<p id="Museum">MŪSĒUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μουσεῖον</span>), the name of an institution
founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus,
about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 280, for the promotion of learning
and the support of learned men. The
museum formed part of the palace, and contained
cloisters or porticoes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίπατος</span>), a
public theatre or lecture-room (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐξέδρα</span>), and
a large hall (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἶκος μέγας</span>), where the learned
men dined together. The museum was supported
by a common fund, supplied apparently
from the public treasury; and the
whole institution was under the superintendence
of a priest, who was appointed by the
king, and after Egypt became a province of
the Roman empire, by the Caesar. Botanical
and zoological gardens appear to have been
attached to the museum.</p>


<p id="Myrii">MȲRĬI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυρίοι</span>), the name given to the
popular assembly of the Arcadians, which
was established after the overthrow of the
Spartan supremacy by the battle of Leuctra,
and which used to meet at Megalopolis in
order to determine upon matters affecting
the whole people.</p>


<p id="Mysia">MYSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μύσια</span>), a festival celebrated by
the inhabitants of Pellene in Achaia in honour
of Demeter Mysia, which lasted for 7 days.</p>


<p id="Mysteria">MYSTĒRĬA. The names by which mysteries
or mystic festivals were designated in
Greece, are <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυστήρια</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελεταί</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄργια</span>. The
name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄργια</span> (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔοργα</span>) originally signified
only sacrifices accompanied by certain ceremonies,
but it was afterwards applied especially
to the ceremonies observed in the worship
of Dionysus, and at a still later period
to mysteries in general. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τελετή</span> signifies, in
general, a religious festival, but more particularly
a lustration or ceremony performed
in order to avert some calamity, either public
or private. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μυστήριον</span> signifies, properly
speaking, the secret part of the worship, but
was also used in the same sense as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελετή</span>,
and for mystic worship in general. Mysteries
in general may be defined as sacrifices
and ceremonies which took place at night or
in secret within some sanctuary, which the
uninitiated were not allowed to enter. What
was essential to them, were objects of worship,
sacred utensils, and traditions with
their interpretation, which were withheld
from all persons not initiated. The most
celebrated mysteries in Greece were those of
Samothrace and Eleusis, which are described
in separate articles. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cabeiria">Cabeiria</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Eleusinia">Eleusinia</a></span>.]</p>

<p id="Navalia">NĀVĀLIA, docks at Rome where ships
were built, laid up, and refitted. They were
attached to the emporium outside of the Porta
Trigemina, and were connected with the
Tiber. The emporium and navalia were first
included within the walls of the city by
Aurelian.&mdash;The docks (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεώσοικοι</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεώρια</span>)
in the Peiraeeus at Athens cost 1000 talents,
and having been destroyed in the anarchy
were again restored and finally completed by
Lycurgus, the contemporary of Demosthenes.
They were under the superintendence of
regular officers, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιμεληταὶ τῶν νεωρίων</span>.</p>


<p id="Navalis">NĀVĀLIS CŎRŌNA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Corona">Corona</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Navarchus">NĀVARCHUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναύαρχος</span>), the name by
which the Greeks designated both the captain
of a single ship, and the admiral of a fleet.
The office itself was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναυαρχία</span>. The
admiral of the Athenian fleet was always one
of the ten generals (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατηγοί</span>) elected every
year, and he had either the whole or the
chief command of the fleet. The chief officers
who served under him were the trierarchs
and the pentecontarchs, each of whom
commanded one vessel; the inferior officers
in the vessels were the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυβερνῆται</span> or helmsmen,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κελευσταί</span> or commanders of the
rowers, and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρωρᾶται</span>, who must have
been employed at the prow of the vessels.
Other Greek states who kept a navy had
likewise their navarchs. The chief admiral
of the Spartan fleet was called navarchus,
and the second in command <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">epistoleus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστολεύς</span>).
The same person was not allowed
to hold the office of navarchus two successive
years at Sparta. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Epistoleus">Epistoleus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Naucraria">NAUCRĀRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναυκραρία</span>), the name of a
division of the inhabitants of Attica. The
four ancient phylae were each divided into
three phratries, and each of these twelve
phratries into four naucraries, of which there
were thus forty-eight. What the naucraries
were previous to the legislation of Solon is
not stated anywhere, but it is not improbable
that they were political divisions similar
to the demes in the constitution of Cleisthenes,
and were made perhaps at the time
of the institution of the nine archons, for the
purpose of regulating the liturgies, taxes, or
financial and military affairs in general. At
any rate, however, the naucraries before the
time of Solon can have had no connection
with the navy, for the Athenians then had
no navy; the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναύκραρος</span> therefore cannot
be derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναῦς</span>, ship, but must
come from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναιω</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναύκραρος</span> is thus only
another form for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναύκληρος</span> in the sense of a
householder, as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναῦλον</span> was used for the rent
of a house. Solon in his legislation retained
the old institution of the naucraries, and
charged each of them with the equipment of
one trireme and with the mounting of two
horsemen. All military affairs, as far as
regards the defraying of expenses, probably
continued as before to be regulated according
to naucraries. Cleisthenes, in his change
of the Solonian constitution, retained the
division into naucraries for military and
financial purposes; but he increased their
number to fifty, making five for each of his
ten tribes; so that now the number of their
ships was increased from forty-eight to fifty,
and that of horsemen from ninety-six to one
hundred. The statement of Herodotus, that
the Athenians in their war against Aegina
had only fifty ships of their own, is thus
perfectly in accordance with the fifty naucraries
of Cleisthenes. The functions of the
former <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναύκραροι</span>, or the heads of their respective
naucraries, were now transferred to
the demarchs. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Demarchi">Demarchi</a>.</span>] The obligation
of each naucrary to equip a ship of war for
the service of the republic may be regarded
as the first form of trierarchy. As the system
of trierarchy became developed and
established, this obligation of the naucraries
appears to have gradually ceased, and to have
fallen into disuse. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Trierarchia">Trierarchia</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Naucrarus">NAUCRĀRUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Naucraria">Naucraria</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Navis">NĀVIS, NĀVĬGIUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναῦς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλοῖον</span>), a
ship. The numerous fleet, with which the
Greeks are said to have sailed to the coast
of Asia Minor, must on the whole be regarded
as sufficient evidence of the extent
to which navigation was carried on in those
times, however much of the detail in the
Homeric description may have arisen from
the poet’s own imagination. In the Homeric
catalogue it is stated that each of the
fifty Boeotian ships carried 120 warriors,
and a ship which carried so many cannot
have been of very small dimensions. What
Homer states of the Boeotian vessels applies
more or less to the ships of other Greeks.
These boats were provided with a mast
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστός</span>) which was fastened by two ropes
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρότονοι</span>) to the two ends of the ship, so that
when the rope connecting it with the prow
broke, the mast would fall towards the stern,
where it might kill the helmsman. The mast
could be erected or taken down as necessity
required. They also had sails (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστία</span>), but
no deck; each vessel however appears to
have had only one sail, which was used in
favourable winds; and the principal means of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
propelling the vessel lay in the rowers, who
sat upon benches (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κληΐδες</span>). The oars were
fastened to the side of the ship with leathern
thongs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροποὶ δερμάτινοι</span>), in which they
were turned as a key in its hole. The ships
in Homer are mostly called black (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέλαιναι</span>),
probably because they were painted or covered
with a black substance, such as pitch,
to protect the wood against the influence of
the water and the air; sometimes other
colours, such as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίλτος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minium</i> (a red colour),
were used to adorn the sides of the
ships near the prow, whence Homer occasionally
calls ships <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μιλτοπάρῃοι</span>, i.e. red-cheeked;
they were also painted occasionally
with a purple colour (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φοινικοπάρῃοι</span>). When
the Greeks had landed on the coast of Troy,
the ships were drawn on land, and fastened
at the poop to large stones with a rope which
served as anchors. The Greeks then surrounded
the fleet with a fortification to secure
it against the attacks of the enemy. This
custom of drawing the ships upon the shore,
when they were not used, was followed in
later times also, as every one will remember
from the accounts in Caesar’s Commentaries.
In the Odyssey (v. 243, &amp;c.) the building of a
boat (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχεδία</span>) is described, though not with the
minuteness which an actual ship-builder might
wish for. Ulysses first cuts down with his axe
twenty trees, and prepares the wood for his
purpose by cutting it smooth and giving it the
proper shape. He then bores the holes for
nails and hooks, and fits the planks together
and fastens them with nails. He rounds
the bottom of the ship like that of a broad
transport vessel, and raises the bulwark
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἴκρια</span>), fitting it upon the numerous ribs of
the ship. He afterwards covers the whole
of the outside with planks, which are laid
across the ribs from the keel upwards to the
bulwark: next the mast is made, and the
sail-yard attached to it, and lastly the rudder.
When the ship is thus far completed, he
raises the bulwark still higher by a wicker-work
which goes all around the vessel, as a
protection against the waves. This raised
bulwark of wicker-work and the like was
used in later times also. For ballast Ulysses
throws into the ship <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕλη</span>, which according to
the Scholiast consisted of wood, stones, and
sand. Calypso then brings him materials to
make a sail of, and he fastens the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπέραι</span> or
ropes which run from the top of the mast to
the two ends of the yard, and also the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλοι</span>
with which the sail is drawn up or let down.
The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόδες</span> mentioned in this passage were
undoubtedly, as in the later times, the ropes
attached to the two lower corners of the
square sail. The ship of which the building
is thus described was a small boat, a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχεδία</span>,
as Homer calls it; but it had like all the Homeric
ships a round or flat bottom. Greater
ships must have been of a more complicated
structure, as ship-builders are praised as
artists. Below (<a href="#ill266b">p. 266</a>), a representation of
two boats is given which appear to bear
great resemblance to the one of which the
building is described in the Odyssey.&mdash;The
Corinthians were the first who brought the
art of ship-building nearest to the point at
which we find it in the time of Thucydides,
and they were the first who introduced ships
with three ranks of rowers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριήρεις</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triremes</i>).
About <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 700, Ameinocles the
Corinthian, to whom this invention is ascribed,
made the Samians acquainted with it; but it
must have been preceded by that of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Biremes</i>, that is, ships with two ranks of
rowers, which Pliny attributes to the Erythraeans.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
These innovations however do not
seem to have been generally adopted for a
long time; for we read that about the time of
Cyrus the Phocaeans introduced long sharp-keeled
ships called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκόντοροι</span>. These belonged
to the class of long war-ships (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νῆες
μακραί</span>), and had fifty rowers, twenty-five on
each side of the ship, who sat in one row.
It is further stated that before this time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
vessels called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρογγύλαι</span>, with large round or
rather flat bottoms, had been used exclusively
by all the Ionians in Asia. At this
period most Greeks seem to have adopted the
long ships with only one rank of rowers on
each side (Moneris).</p>

as they had fifty (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκόντοροι</span>),
or thirty (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριακόντοροι</span>), or even a smaller
number of rowers. A ship of war of this
class is represented in the preceding woodcut.

</div>

<p>The first Greek people whom
we know to have acquired a navy of importance
were the Corinthians, Samians, and
Phocaeans. About the time of Cyrus and
Cambyses the Corinthian Triremes were generally
adopted by the Sicilian tyrants and
by the Corcyraeans, who soon acquired the
most powerful navies among the Greeks. In
other parts of Greece and even at Athens
and in Aegina the most common vessels
about this time were long ships with only
one rank of rowers on each side. Athens,
although the foundation of its maritime
power had been laid by Solon [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Naucraria">Naucraria</a></span>],
did not obtain a fleet of any importance until
the time of Themistocles, who persuaded the
Athenians to build 200 Triremes for the purpose
of carrying on the war against Aegina. But
even then ships were not provided with complete
decks (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταστρώματα</span>) covering the
whole of the vessel. Ships with only a
partial deck or with no deck at all, were
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄφρακτοι νῆες</span>, and in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">naves apertae</i>.
Even at the time of the Persian war,
the Athenian ships were without a complete
deck. Ships which had a complete deck were
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατάφρακτοι</span>, and the deck itself <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατάστρωμα</span>.
At the time when Themistocles induced
the Athenians to build a fleet of 200
sail he also carried a decree, that every year
twenty new Triremes should be built from the
produce of the mines of Laurium. After the
time of Themistocles as many as twenty Triremes
must have been built every year both in
times of war and of peace, as the average
number of Triremes which was always ready
amounted to between three and four hundred.
Such an annual addition was the
more necessary, as the vessels were of a light
structure and did not last long. The whole
superintendence of the building of new Triremes
was in the hands of the senate of the
Five Hundred, but the actual business was entrusted
to a committee called the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριηροποιοί</span>,
one of whom acted as their treasurer, and
had in his keeping the money set apart for
the purpose. Under the Macedonian supremacy
the Rhodians became the greatest maritime
power in Greece. The navy of Sparta
was never of great importance. Navigation
remained for the most part what it had been
before; the Greeks seldom ventured out into
the open sea, and it was generally considered
necessary to remain in sight of the coast or
of some island, which also served as guides
in daytime: in the night the position, rising
and setting of the different stars answered
the same purpose. In winter navigation
generally ceased altogether. In cases where
it would have been necessary to coast around
a considerable extent of country, which was
connected with the main land by a narrow
neck, the ships were sometimes drawn across
the neck of land from one sea to the other,
by machines called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁλκοί</span>. This was done
most frequently across the isthmus of Corinth.&mdash;The
various kinds of ships used by
the Greeks might be divided, according to
the number of ranks of rowers employed in
them, into Moneres, Biremes, Triremes, Quadriremes,
Quinqueremes, &amp;c., up to the enormous
ship with forty ranks of rowers, built
by Ptolemaeus Philopator. But all these appear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
to have been constructed on the same
principle, and it is more convenient to divide
them into <em>ships of war</em> and <em>ships of burden</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φορτικὰ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φορτηγοὶ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁλκάδες</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλοῖα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρογγύλαι</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">naves onerariae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">naves actuariae</i>).
Ships of the latter kind were not calculated
for quick movement or rapid sailing, but to
carry the greatest possible quantity of goods.
Hence their structure was bulky, their bottom
round, and although they were not without
rowers, yet the chief means by which they
were propelled were their sails. The most
common ships of war in the earlier times
were the pentecontori (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκόντοροι</span>), but
afterwards they were chiefly Triremes, and
the latter are frequently designated only by
the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νῆες</span>, while all the others are called
by the name indicating their peculiar character.
Triremes however were again divided
into two classes: the one consisting of
real men-of-war, which were quick-sailing
vessels (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταχεῖαι</span>), and the other of transports
either for soldiers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατιώτιδες</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁπλιταγωγοί</span>)
or for horses (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππηγοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππαγωγοί</span>).
Ships of this class were more heavy and awkward,
and were therefore not used in battle
except in cases of necessity. The ordinary
size of a war galley may be inferred from
the fact that the average number of men engaged
in it, including the crew and marines,
was two hundred, to whom on some occasions
as many as thirty epibatae were added.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Epibatae">Epibatae</a>.</span>]&mdash;Vessels with more than three
ranks of rowers on each side were not constructed
in Greece till about the year 400
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when Dionysius I., tyrant of Syracuse,
who bestowed great care upon his navy, built
the first Quadriremes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετρήρεις</span>), and Quinqueremes
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντήρεις</span>). In the reign of Dionysius
II., Hexeres (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑξήρεις</span>) are also mentioned.
After the time of Alexander the
Great the use of vessels with four, five, and
more ranks of rowers became very general,
and it is well known that the first Punic war
was chiefly carried on with Quinqueremes.
Ships with twelve, thirty, or even forty ranks
of rowers, such as they were built by Alexander
and the Ptolemies, appear to have
been mere curiosities, and did not come into
common use. The Athenians at first did not
adopt vessels larger than Triremes, probably
because they thought that with rapidity and
skill they could do more than with large and
unwieldy ships. In the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 356 they
continued to use nothing but Triremes; but
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 330 the republic had already a number
of Quadriremes, which was afterwards
increased. The first Quinqueremes at Athens
are mentioned in a document belonging to
the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 325.&mdash;Among the smaller
vessels we may mention the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκατος</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκάτιον</span>, which seems to have been sometimes
used as a ship of burden. The name Scapha
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκάφη</span>) denotes a small skiff or life-boat,
which was commonly attached to merchantmen
for the purpose of saving the crew in
danger.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liburna</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liburnica</i>, in Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λιβυρνίς</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λιβυρνόν</span>, is a name given apparently
to every war-ship, from a bireme up
to those with six lines of rowers on each
side, but in the time of Augustus, liburnae
even with six lines of rowers were considered
small and swift in comparison with the unwieldy
ships of Antony at Actium. They
were usually provided with a beak, whence a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">navis rostrata</i> is generally the same as a
Liburna. They were first constructed by the
Liburnians (whence they derived their name),
and formed the main part of the fleet of Augustus
in the battle of Actium.&mdash;Every vessel
at Athens, as in modern times, had a name
given to it, which was generally of the feminine
gender. The Romans sometimes gave
to their ships masculine names. The Greek
names were either taken from ancient heroines
such as Nausicaa, or they were abstract
words such as <em>Forethought</em>, <em>Safety</em>, <em>Guidance</em>,
&amp;c. In many cases the name of the
builder also was added.&mdash;The Romans appear
to have first become aware of the importance
of a fleet during the second Samnite war, in
the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 311: when <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duumviri navales</i>
were for the first time appointed by the
people. The ships which the Romans now
built were undoubtedly Triremes. This fleet,
however insignificant it may have been, continued
to be kept up until the time when
Rome became a real maritime power. In the
year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 260, when the Romans saw that
without a navy they could not carry on the
war against Carthage with any advantage,
the senate ordained that a fleet should be
built. Triremes would now have been of no
avail against the high-bulwarked vessels
(Quinqueremes) of the Carthaginians. But
the Romans would have been unable to build
others had not fortunately a Carthaginian
Quinquereme been wrecked on the coast of
Bruttium, and fallen into their hands. This
wreck the Romans took as their model, and
after it built 120, or according to others 130
ships. From this time forward the Romans
continued to keep up a powerful navy. Towards
the end of the Republic they also increased
the size of their ships, and built war
vessels of from six to ten ranks of rowers.
The construction of their ships, however,
scarcely differed from that of Greek vessels;
the only great difference was that the Roman
galleys were provided with a greater variety
of destructive engines of war than those of
the Greeks. They even erected turres and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
tabulata upon the decks of their great men-of-war
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">naves turritae</i>), and fought upon
them as if they were standing upon the walls
of a fortress (see cut, <a href="#ill260">p. 260</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>We now proceed to describe the parts
of ancient vessels.&mdash;1. The prow (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρώρα</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέτωπον</span>, prora) was generally ornamented on
both sides with figures, which were either
painted upon the sides or laid in. It seems
to have been very common to represent an
eye on each side of the prow. Upon the
prow or fore-deck there was always some
emblem (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παράσημον</span>, insigne, figura) by which
the ship was distinguished from others. At the
head of the prow there projected the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στόλος</span>,
and its extremity was termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκροστόλιον</span>,
which was frequently made in the shape of
an animal or a helmet. It appears to have
been sometimes covered with brass and to
have served as an embole (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐμβολή</span>) against
the enemy’s vessels. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκροστόλιον</span> is sometimes
designated by the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χηνίσκος</span>
(from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χήν</span>, a goose), because it was formed in
the shape of the head or neck of a goose or
swan, as in the accompanying woodcut.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp78" id="ill264a" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill264a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Cheniscus. (From a Painting at Herculaneum.)</div>
</div>

<p>The cheniscus was often gilt and made of bronze.
Just below the prow and projecting a little
above the keel was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rostrum</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμβολος</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμβολον</span>) or beak, which consisted of a beam,
to which were attached sharp and pointed
irons, or the head of a ram and the like.
This <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔμβολος</span> was used for the purpose of attacking
another vessel and of breaking its
sides. These beaks were at first always
above the water and visible; afterwards they
were attached lower, so that they were invisible,
and thus became still more dangerous
to other ships. The annexed woodcuts
represent three different beaks of ships.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="ill264b" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill264b.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Rostra, Beaks of Ships. (Montfaucon, pl. 133.)</div>
</div>

<p>The command in the prow of a vessel was
exercised by an officer called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρωρεύς</span>, who
seems to have been next in rank to the
steersman, and to have had the care of the
gear, and the command over the rowers.&mdash;2.
<em>The stern</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρύμνη</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puppis</i>) was generally
above the other parts of the deck, and in it
the helmsman had his elevated seat. It is
seen in the representations of ancient vessels
to be rounder than the prow, though its extremity
is likewise sharp. The stern was,
like the prow, adorned in various ways, but
especially with the image of the tutelary
deity of the vessel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tutela</i>). In some representations
a kind of roof is formed over the
head of the steersman, and the upper part
of the stern frequently has an elegant ornament
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aplustre</i>, and in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄφλαστον</span>,
which constituted the highest part of the
poop. It formed a corresponding ornament
to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκροστόλιον</span> at the prow. At the
junction of the aplustre with the stern on
which it was based, we commonly observe
an ornament resembling a circular shield:
this was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσπιδεῖον</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσπιδίσκη</span>. It is
seen on the two aplustria here represented.
The aplustre rose immediately behind the
gubernator, and served in some degree to
protect him from wind and rain. Sometimes
there appears, beside the aplustre, a pole, to
which a fillet or pennon (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταινία</span>) was attached,
which served both to distinguish and adorn
the vessel, and also to show the direction of
the wind.&mdash;3. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τράφηξ</span> is the bulwark of
the vessel, or rather the uppermost edge of it.
In small boats the pegs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκαλμοί</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalmi</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]<br /><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
between which the oars move, and to which
they are fastened by a thong (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροπωτήρ</span>),
were upon the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τράφηξ</span>. In all other vessels
the oars passed through holes in the side of
the vessel (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀφθαλμοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρήματα</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρυπήματα</span>).&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp50" id="ill265a" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill265a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Aphlaston, Aplustre.</div>
</div>

<p>4. The middle part of the deck in most
ships of war appears to have been raised
above the bulwark, or at least to a level with
its upper edge, and thus enabled the soldiers
to occupy a position from which they could
see far around and hurl their darts against
the enemy. Such an elevated deck appears
in the annexed woodcut representing a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Moneris</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp93" id="ill265b" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill265b.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Moneris. (From a Painting at Pompeii.)</div>
</div>

<p>In this instance the flag is standing
upon the hind-deck.&mdash;5. One of the most
interesting, as well as important parts in the
arrangements of the Biremes, Triremes, &amp;c.,
is the position of the ranks of rowers, from
which the ships themselves derive their
names. Various opinions have been entertained
by those who have written upon this
subject. Thus much is certain, that the
different ranks of rowers, who sat along the
sides of a vessel, were placed one above the
other. In ordinary vessels, from the Moneris
up to the Quinqueremis, each oar was
managed by one man. The rowers sat upon
little benches attached to the ribs of the
vessel, and called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑδώλια</span>, and in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fori</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transtra</i>. The lowest row of rowers
was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θαλάμος</span>, the rowers themselves,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θαλαμῖται</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θαλάμιοι</span>. The uppermost ordo
of rowers was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θράνος</span>, and the rowers
themselves <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρανῖται</span>. The middle ordo or
ordines of rowers were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζυγὰ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζύγιοι</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζυγῖται</span>. Each of this last class of rowers
had likewise his own seat, and did not, as
some have supposed, sit upon benches running
across the vessel. The gear of a vessel
was divided into <em>wooden</em> and <em>hanging gear</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκεύη ξύλινα</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκεύη κρεμαστά</span>).</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Wooden Gear.</span>&mdash;1. <em>Oars</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κώπαι</span>, remi).
The collective term for oars is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταῤῥός</span>, which
properly signified only the blade or flat part
of the oar, but was afterwards used as
a collective expression for all the oars, with
the exception of the rudder. The oars varied
in size accordingly as they were used by a
lower or higher ordo of rowers, and from the
name of the ordo by which they were used,
they also received their special names, viz.,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κώπαι θαλάμιαι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζύγιαι</span>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρανίτιδες</span>. Each
Trireme had on an average 170 rowers. In
a Roman Quinquereme during the first Punic
war, the average number of rowers was 300;
in later times we even find as many as 400.
The lower part of the holes through which
the oars passed appears to have been covered
with leather (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄσκωμα</span>), which also extended
a little way outside the hole.&mdash;2. <em>The rudder</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πηδάλιον</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gubernaculum</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp85" id="ill266a" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill266a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Gubernacula, rudders. (From an ancient Lamp and Gems.)</div>
</div>

<p>Before the invention
of the rudder, vessels must have been
propelled and guided by the oars alone.
This circumstance may account for the form
of the ancient rudder, as well as for the
mode of using it. It was like an oar with a
very broad blade, and was commonly placed
on each side of the stern, not at its extremity.
The annexed woodcut presents examples
of its appearance as it is frequently
exhibited on gems, coins, and other works of
art. The figure in the centre shows a Triton
blowing the buccina, and holding a rudder
over his shoulder. The left-hand figure
represents a rudder with its helm or tiller
crossed by the cornucopia. In the third
figure Venus leans with her left arm upon a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
rudder to indicate her origin from the sea.
The rudder was managed by the gubernator
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυβερνήτης</span>), who is also called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rector
navis</i> as distinguished from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister</i>.
A ship had sometimes one, but more commonly
two rudders; but they were managed
by the steersman to prevent confusion.
In larger ships the two rudders were joined
by a pole, which was moved by the gubernator,
and kept the rudders parallel. The
contrivances for attaching the two rudders
to one another and to the sides of the ship,
are called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζεῦγλαι</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζευκτηρίαι</span>.&mdash;3. <span id="Scalae_n"><em>Ladders</em></span>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλιμακίδες</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalae</i>). Each Trireme had two
wooden ladders, and the same seems to have
been the case in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριακόντοροι</span>.&mdash;<span id="Contus">4.</span> <em>Poles</em> or
punt poles (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοντοί</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conti</i>). Three of these,
of different lengths, belonged to every Trireme.&mdash;5.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Παραστάται</span> or supports for the
masts. They seem to have been a kind of
props placed at the foot of the masts.&mdash;6.
The <em>mast</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστός</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">malus</i>). The ancients had
vessels with one, two, or three masts. The
fore-mast was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκάτειος</span>, the mainmast,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc"><ins class="corr" id="tn-266" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'ἱστός'">
ἱστὸς</ins> μέγας</span>. A triaconter, or a vessel with
30 rowers, had likewise two masts, and the
smaller mast here, as well as in a trireme,
was near the prow. In three-masted vessels
the largest mast was nearest the stern. The
masts as well as the yards were usually of
fir. The part of the mast immediately above
the yard (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">antenna</i>), formed a structure similar
to a drinking-cup, and bore the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carchesium</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καρχήσιον</span>). Into it the mariners
ascended in order to manage the sail, to
obtain a distant view, or to discharge missiles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
Breastworks (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θωράκια</span>) were fixed to
these structures, so as to supply the place of
defensive armour; and pulleys (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροχηλίαι</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trochleae</i>) for hoisting up stones and weapons
from below. The continuation of the mast
above the carchesium was called the “distaff”
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἠλακάτη</span>), corresponding to our top-mast
or top-gallant mast.&mdash;7. The <em>yards</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κέρα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεραίαι</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">antennae</i>).</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp82" id="ill266b" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill266b.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Ceruchi. (From an ancient Lamp.)</div>
</div>

<p>The mainyard was fastened to the top of the mast by ropes
termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ceruchi</i>, as seen in the preceding woodcut.
To the mainyard was attached the
mainsail, which was hoisted or let down as
the occasion might require. In the two extremities
of the yard (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornua</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκροκέραιαι</span>),
ropes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ceruchi</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κηροῦχοι</span>) were attached, which
passed to the top of the mast; and by means
of these ropes and the pulleys connected
with them, the yard and sail, guided by the
hoop, were hoisted to the height required.
There are numerous representations of ancient
ships in which the antenna is seen, as
in the two woodcuts here appended. In the
second of them there are ropes hanging
down from the antenna, the object of which
was to enable the sailors to turn the antenna
and the sail according to the wind.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Hanging Gear.</span>&mdash;1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hypozomata</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὑποζώματα</span>),
thick and broad ropes running in
a horizontal direction around the ship from
the stern to the prow, and intended to keep
the whole fabric together. They ran round the
vessel in several circles, and at certain distances
from one another. The Latin name for
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπόζωμα</span> is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tormentum</i>. Sometimes they were
taken on board when a vessel sailed, and not
put on till it was thought necessary. The
act of putting them on was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποζωννύναι</span>,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαζωννύναι</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζῶσαι</span>. A Trireme
required four <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑποζώματα</span>.&mdash;2. <em>The sail</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἱστίον</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velum</i>). Most ancient ships had only one
sail, which was attached with the yard to
the great mast. In a Trireme also one sail
might be sufficient, but the trierarch might
nevertheless add a second. As each of the
two masts of a Trireme had two sail-yards,
it further follows that each mast might have
two sails, one of which was placed lower
than the other. The two belonging to the
mainmast were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστία μεγάλα</span>, and
those of the fore-mast <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστία ἀκάτεια</span>. The
former were used on ordinary occasions, but
the latter probably only in cases when it was
necessary to sail with extraordinary speed.
The sails of the Attic war-galleys, and of
most ancient ships in general, were of a
square form. Whether triangular sails were
ever used by the Greeks, as has been frequently
supposed, is very doubtful. The
Romans, however, used triangular sails,
which they called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Suppara</i>, and which had
the shape of an inverted Greek Δ (⛛), the
upper side of which was attached to the
yard.&mdash;3. <em>Cordage</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοπεῖα</span>) differed from the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχοινία</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλοι</span>. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχοινία</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funes</i>) are
the strong ropes to which the anchors were
attached, and by which a ship was fastened
to the land; while the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοπεῖα</span> were a lighter
kind of ropes and made with greater care,
which were attached to the masts, yards,
and sails. Each rope of this kind was made
for a distinct purpose and place (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόπος</span>, whence
the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τοπεῖα</span>). The following kinds are
most worthy of notice:&mdash;<em>a</em>. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλῴδια</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλοι</span>,
were probably the ropes by which the mast
was fastened to both sides of the ship, so
that the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρότονοι</span> in the Homeric ships were
only an especial kind of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλῴδια</span>, or the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλῴδια</span> themselves differently placed. In
later times the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρότονος</span> was the rope which
went from the top of the mainmast (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καρχήσιον</span>)
to the prow of the ship, and thus was
what is now called the main-stay. <em>b</em>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceruchi</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεροῦχοι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱμάντες</span>), ropes which ran from the
two ends of the sail-yard to the top of the
mast. In more ancient vessels the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱμὰς</span> consisted
of only one rope; in later times it
consisted of two, and sometimes four, which
uniting at the top of the mast, and there
passing through a ring, descended on the
other side, where it formed the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίτονος</span>,
by means of which the sail was drawn up or
let down. <em>c</em>. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγκοινα</span>, Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anquina</i>, was
the rope which went from the middle of a
yard to the top of the mast, and was intended
to facilitate the drawing up and letting down
of the sail. <em>d</em>. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πόδες</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pedes</i>) were in later
times, as in the poems of Homer, the ropes
attached to the two lower corners of a square
sail. These <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόδες</span> ran from the ends of the
sail to the sides of the vessel towards the
stern, where they were fastened with rings
attached to the outer side of the bulwark.
<em>e</em>. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὑπέραι</span> were the two ropes attached to
the two ends of the sail-yard, and thence
came down to a part of the ship near the
stern. Their object was to move the yard
according to the wind. In Latin they are
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opifera</i>, which is, perhaps, only a corruption
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hypera</i>.&mdash;4. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Παραῤῥύματα</span>. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
ancients as early as the time of Homer had
various preparations raised above the edge
of a vessel, which were made of skins and
wicker-work, and which were intended as a
protection against high waves, and also to
serve as a kind of breast-work behind which
the men might be safe against the darts of
the enemy. These elevations of the bulwark
are called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραῤῥύματα</span>. They were probably
fixed upon the edge on both sides of the
vessel, and were taken off when not wanted.
Each galley appears to have had several
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραῤῥύματα</span>, two made of hair and two
white ones, these four being regularly mentioned
as belonging to one ship.&mdash;5. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σχοινία</span>
are the stronger and heavier kinds of ropes.
There were two kinds of these, viz. the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχοινία ἀγκύρεια</span>, to which the anchor was
attached, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχοινία ἐπίγυα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίγεια</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">retinacula</i>),
by which the ship was fastened to
the shore or drawn upon the shore.&mdash;6. The
<em>anchor</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγκύρα</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ancora</i>). We have already
remarked that in the Homeric age anchors
were not known, and large stones (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐναὶ</span>,
<em>sleepers</em>) used in their stead. When anchors
came to be used, they were generally made
of iron, and their form resembled that of a
modern anchor. Such an anchor was often
termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bidens</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διπλῆ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίβολος</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίστομος</span>,
because it had two teeth or flukes;
but sometimes it had only one, and was then
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑτεροστόμος</span>. The technical expressions
in the use of the anchor are: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ancoram
solvere</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγκύραν χαλᾷν</span>, to loose the anchor;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ancoram jacere</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγκύραν βάλλειν</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥίπτειν</span>,
to cast anchor; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ancoram tollere</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγκύραν
αἴρειν</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναίρεσθαι</span>, to weigh anchor, whence
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἴρειν</span> by itself means “to set sail,” <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγκύραν</span>
being understood. The following figure
shows the cable (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funis</i>), passing through a
hole in the prow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oculus</i>). Each ship of
course had several anchors. The last or
most powerful anchor, “the last hope,” was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερά</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacra</i>, and persons trying their
last hope were said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacram solvere</i>.&mdash;The
preceding account of the different parts of
the ship will be rendered still clearer by the
drawing on <a href="#ill263">p. 263</a>.</p>

<p id="Naumachia">NAUMĂCHIA, the name given to the
representation of a sea-fight among the Romans,
and also to the place where such engagements
were exhibited. These fights
sometimes took place in the circus or amphitheatre,
sufficient water being introduced to
float ships, but more generally in buildings
especially devoted to this purpose. The
combatants in these sea-fights, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Naumachiarii</i>,
were usually captives, or criminals
condemned to death, who fought as in
gladiatorial combats, until one party was
killed, unless preserved by the clemency of
the emperor. The ships engaged in the sea
fights were divided into two parties, called
respectively by the names of different maritime
nations, as Tyrians and Egyptians, Rhodians
and Sicilians, Persians and Athenians,
Corcyraeans and Corinthians, Athenians and
Syracusans, &amp;c. These sea-fights were exhibited
with the same magnificence and lavish
expenditure of human life as characterised
the gladiatorial combats and other public
games of the Romans. In Nero’s naumachia
there were sea-monsters swimming about in
the artificial lake. In the sea-fight exhibited
by Titus there were 3000 men engaged, and
in that exhibited by Domitian the ships were
almost equal in number to two real fleets.</p>


<p id="Nautodicae">NAUTŎDĬCAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναυτόδικαι</span>), magistrates at
Athens, who had jurisdiction in matters belonging
to navigation and commerce, and in
matters concerning such persons as had entered
their names as members of a phratria<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
without both their parents being citizens of
Athens, or in other words, in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαι ἐμπόρων</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαι ξενίας</span>. The time when nautodicae
were first instituted is not mentioned, but it
must have been previous to Pericles, and
perhaps as early as the time of Cleisthenes.
The nautodicae were appointed every year
by lot in the month of Gamelion, and probably
attended to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαι ἐμπόρων</span> only during
the winter, when navigation ceased,
whereas the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκαι ξενίας</span> might be brought
before them all the year round.</p>


<p id="Nefasti">NĔFASTI DIES. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Dies">Dies</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Negotiatores">NĔGŌTĬĀTŌRES, signified specially during
the later times of the republic Roman
citizens settled in the provinces, who lent
money upon interest or bought up corn on
speculation, which they sent to Rome as well
as to other places. Their chief business however
was lending money upon interest, and
hence we find the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">negotia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">negotiatio</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">negotiari</i> used in this sense. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">negotiatores</i>
are distinguished from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">publicani</i>,
and from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mercatores</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">negotiatores</i>
in the provinces corresponded to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">argentarii</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feneratores</i> at Rome.</p>


<p id="Nemea">NĔMEA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νέμεα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεμεῖα</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεμαῖα</span>), the Nemean
games, one of the four great national
festivals of the Greeks. It was held at Nemea,
a place near Cleonae in Argolis, and is
said to have been originally instituted by the
Seven against Thebes in commemoration of
the death of Opheltes, afterwards called Archemorus.
The games were revived by Hercules,
after he had slain the Nemean lion; and
were from this time celebrated in honour of
Zeus. They were at first of a warlike character,
and only warriors and their sons were
allowed to take part in them; subsequently,
however, they were thrown open to all the
Greeks. The various games were horse-racing,
running in armour in the stadium,
wrestling, chariot-racing and the discus, boxing,
throwing the spear and shooting with
the bow, to which we may add musical contests.
The prize given to the victors was at
first a chaplet of olive-branches, but afterwards
a chaplet of green parsley. The presidency
of these games, and the management
of them, belonged at different times to Cleonae,
Corinth, and Argos. They were celebrated
twice in every Olympiad, viz. at the
commencement of every second Olympic year,
in the winter, and soon after the commencement
of every fourth Olympic year, in the
summer.</p>


<p id="Nenia">NĒNIA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a></span>, <a href="#Page_188">p. 188</a>, <em>a.</em>]</p>


<p id="Neocori">NĔŌCŎRI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεωκόροι</span>), signified originally
temple-sweepers, but was applied even in
early times to priestly officers of high rank,
who had the supreme superintendence of
temples and their treasures. Under the Roman
emperors the word was especially applied
to those cities in Asia, which erected
temples to the Roman emperors, since the
whole city in every such case was regarded
as the guardian of the worship of the emperor.
Accordingly we frequently find on
the coins of Ephesus, Smyrna, and other
cities, the epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Νεωκόρος</span>, which also occurs
on the inscriptions of these cities.</p>


<p id="Neptunalia">NEPTŪNĀLĬA, a festival of Neptune,
celebrated at Rome, of which very little is
known. The day on which it was held was
probably the 23rd of July. In the ancient
calendaria this day is marked as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nept. ludi
et feriae</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nept. ludi</i>, from which we see
that the festival was celebrated with games.</p>


<p id="Nexum">NEXUM, was either the transfer of the
ownership of a thing, or the transfer of a
thing to a creditor as a security; accordingly
in one sense Nexum included Mancipium
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mancipium">Mancipium</a></span>]; in another sense, Mancipium
and Nexum are opposed in the same way in
which Sale and Mortgage or Pledge are opposed.
The formal part of both transactions
consisted in a transfer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per aes et libram</i>.
The person who became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nexus</i> by the effect
of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nexum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nexus</i> (for this form of the
word also is used) was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nexum inire</i>.
The phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nexi datio</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nexi liberatio</i>, respectively
express the contracting and the
release from the obligation. The Roman law
as to the payment of borrowed money was
very strict. By a law of the Twelve Tables,
if the debtor admitted the debt, or had been
condemned in the amount of the debt by a
judex, he had thirty days allowed him for
payment. At the expiration of this time, he
was liable to be assigned over to the creditor
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">addictus</i>) by the sentence of the praetor.
The creditor was required to keep him for
sixty days in chains, during which time he
publicly exposed the debtor on three nundinae,
and proclaimed the amount of his debt.
If no person released the prisoner by paying
the debt, the creditor might sell him as a
slave or put him to death. If there were
several creditors, the letter of the law allowed
them to cut the debtor in pieces, and to take
their share of his body in proportion to their
debt. There is no instance of a creditor ever
having adopted this extreme mode of satisfying
his debt. But the creditor might treat
the debtor, who was addictus, as a slave, and
compel him to work out his debt; and the
treatment was often very severe. The Lex
Poetilia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 326) alleviated the condition
of the nexi. So far as we can understand
its provisions, it set all the nexi free, or
made them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">soluti</i>, and it enacted that for the
future there should be no nexum, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
no debtor should for the future be put in
chains.</p>


<p id="Nobiles">NŌBILES, NŌBĬLĬTAS. In the early
periods of the Roman state the Patricians
were the Nobles as opposed to the Plebs.
In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 366, the plebeians obtained the right
of being eligible to the consulship, and finally
they obtained access to all the curule magistracies.
Thus the two classes were put on
the same footing as to political capacity; but
now a new order of nobility arose. The descendants
of plebeians who had filled curule
magistracies, formed a class called <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nobiles</span> or
men “known,” who were so called by way
of distinction from “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ignobiles</span>” or people
who were not known. The Nobiles had no
legal privileges as such; but they were bound
together by a common distinction derived
from a legal title and by a common interest;
and their common interest was to endeavour
to confine the election to all the high magistracies
to the members of their body, to the
Nobilitas. Thus the descendants of those
Plebeians who had won their way to distinction
combined to exclude other Plebeians
from the distinction which their own ancestors
had transmitted to them. The external
distinction of the Nobiles was the Jus Imaginum,
a right or privilege which was apparently
established on usage only, and not on
any positive enactments. These Imagines
were figures with painted masks of wax,
made to resemble the person whom they
represented; and they were placed in the
Atrium of the house, apparently in small
wooden receptacles or cases somewhat in the
form of temples. The Imagines were accompanied
with the tituli or names of distinction
which the deceased had acquired; and the
tituli were connected in some way by lines
or branches so as to exhibit the pedigree
(stemma) of the family. These Imagines
were generally enclosed in their cases, but
they were opened on festival days and other
great ceremonials, and crowned with bay
(laureatae): they also formed part of a solemn
funeral procession. It seems probable
that the Roman Nobilitas, in the strict sense
of that term, and the Jus Imaginum, originated
with the admission of the Plebeians to
the consulship <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 366. A plebeian who
first attained a Curule office was the founder
of his family’s Nobilitas (princeps nobilitatis;
auctor generis). Such a person could have
no imagines of his ancestors; and he could
have none of his own, for such imagines of
a man were not made till after he was dead.
Such a person then was not nobilis in the
full sense of the term, nor yet was he ignobilis.
He was called by the Romans a “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">novus
homo</span>” or a new man; and his status or
condition was called Novitas. The term
novus homo was never applied to a Patrician.
The two most distinguished “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">novi homines</span>”
were C. Marius and M. Tullius Cicero, both
natives of an Italian municipium. The Patricians
would of course be jealous of the new
nobility; but this new nobility once formed
would easily unite with the old aristocracy
of Rome to keep the political power in their
hands, and to prevent more novi homines
from polluting this exclusive class. As early
as the second Punic war this new class, compounded
of Patricians or original aristocrats,
and Nobiles or newly-engrafted aristocrats,
was able to exclude novi homines from the
consulship. They maintained this power to
the end of the republican period, and the
consulship continued almost in the exclusive
possession of the Nobilitas. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Optimates</i>
were the Nobilitas and the chief part of the
Equites, a rich middle class, and also all
others whose support the Nobilitas and Equites
could command, in fact all who were opposed
to change that might affect the power
of the Nobilitas and the interests of those
whom the Nobilitas allied with themselves.
Optimates in this sense are opposed to Plebs,
to the mass of the people; and Optimates is
a wider term than Nobilitas, inasmuch as it
would comprehend the Nobilitas and all who
adhered to them.</p>


<p id="Nomen">NŌMEN (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄνομα</span>), a name. The Greeks
bore only one name, and it was one of the
especial rights of a father to choose the
names for his children, and to alter them if
he pleased. It was customary to give to the
eldest son the name of the grandfather on
his father’s side; and children usually received
their names on the tenth day after
their birth.&mdash;Originally every Roman citizen
belonged to a gens, and derived his name
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen gentilicium</i>) from his gens,
which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen gentilicium</i> generally terminated
in <em>ius</em>. Besides this, every Roman had a
name, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praenomen</i>, which preceded the
nomen gentilicium, and which was peculiar
to him as an individual, <em>e.g.</em> Caius, Lucius,
Marcus, Cneius, Sextus, &amp;c. This praenomen
was at a later time given to boys on the
ninth day after their birth, and to girls on
the eighth day. This day was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies
lustricus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies nominum</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nominalia</i>. The
praenomen given to a boy was in most cases
that of the father, but sometimes that of the
grandfather or great-grandfather. These
two names, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praenomen</i> and a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen gentilicium</i>,
or simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomen</i>, were indispensable
to a Roman, and they were at the same time
sufficient to designate him; hence the numerous
instances of Romans being designated
only by these two names, even in cases where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
a third or fourth name was possessed by the
person. Every Roman citizen, besides belonging
to a gens, was also frequently a
member of a familia, contained in a gens,
and accordingly might have a third name or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognomen</i>. Such cognomina were derived by
the Romans from a variety of mental or
bodily peculiarities, or from some remarkable
event in the life of the person who was the
founder of the familia. Such cognomina are,
Asper, Imperiosus, Magnus, Maximus, Publicola,
Brutus, Capito, Cato, Naso, Labeo,
Caecus, Cicero, Scipio, Sulla, Torquatus, &amp;c.
These names were in most cases hereditary,
and descended to the latest members of a
familia; in some cases they ceased with the
death of the person to whom they were given
for special reasons. Many Romans had a
second cognomen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cognomen secundum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agnomen</i>),
which was given to them as an honorary
distinction, and in commemoration of
some memorable deed or event of their life,
<em>e.g.</em> Africanus, Asiaticus, Hispallus, Cretensis,
Macedonicus, Allobrogicus, &amp;c. Such
agnomina were sometimes given by one general
to another, sometimes by the army and
confirmed by the chief-general, sometimes by
the people in the comitia, and sometimes they
were assumed by the person himself, as in
the case of L. Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus.
The regular order in which these names followed
one another was:&mdash;1. praenomen;
2. nomen gentilicium; 3. cognomen primum;
4. cognomen secundum or agnomen.
Sometimes the name of the tribe to which a
person belonged, was added to his name, in
the ablative case, as Q. Verres Romilia, C.
Claudius Palatina. If a person by adoption
passed from one gens into another, he assumed
the praenomen, nomen, and cognomen
of his adoptive father, and added to these the
name of his former gens, with the termination
<em>anus</em>. Thus C. Octavius, after being
adopted by his uncle C. Julius Caesar, was
called C. Julius Caesar Octavianus, and the
son of L. Aemilius Paullus, when adopted by
P. Cornelius Scipio, was called P. Cornelius
Scipio Aemilianus. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Adoptio">Adoptio</a>.</span>] Slaves had
only one name, and usually retained that
which they had borne before they came into
slavery. If a slave was restored to freedom,
he received the praenomen and nomen gentilicium
of his former master, and to these
was added the name which he had had as a
slave. Instances of such freedmen are, T.
Ampius Menander, a freedman of T. Ampius
Balbus, L. Cornelius Chrysogonus, a freedman
of L. Cornelius Sulla, and M. Tullius Tiro,
freedman of M. Tullius Cicero.</p>


<p id="Nomophylaces">NŎMŎPHỸLĂCES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νομοφύλακες</span>), certain
magistrates or official persons of high authority,
who exercised a control over other magistrates,
and indeed over the whole body of
the people, it being their duty to see that the
laws were duly administered and obeyed.
Mention is made of such officers at Sparta
and elsewhere, but no such body existed at
Athens, for they must have had a power too
great for the existence of a democracy. The
Senate of 500, or the Areopagitic council,
performed in some measure the office of law-guardians;
but the only persons designated
by this name appear to have been inferior
functionaries (a sort of police), whose business
it was to prevent irregularities and disturbances
in the public assemblies.</p>


<p id="Nomos">NŎMOS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμος</span>). This word comprehends
the notion not only of established or statute
law, but likewise of all customs and opinions
to which long prescription or natural feeling
gives the force of law. Before any written
codes appeared, law was promulgated by the
poets or wise men, who sang the great deeds
of their ancestors, and delivered their moral
and political lessons in verse. As civilisation
advanced, laws were reduced to writing, in
the shape either of regular codes or distinct
ordinances, and afterwards publicly exhibited,
engraved on tablets, or hewn on columns.
The first written laws we hear of are those
of Zaleucus. The first at Athens were those
of Draco, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεσμοὶ</span>, and by that name
distinguished from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμοι</span> of Solon. The
laws of Lycurgus were not written. He enjoined
that they should never be inscribed on
any other tablet than the hearts of his countrymen.
Those of Solon were inscribed on
wooden tablets, arranged in pyramidal blocks,
turning on an axis, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄξονες</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύρβεις</span>.
They were first hung in the Acropolis, but
afterwards brought down to the Prytaneum.</p>


<p id="Nomothetae">NŎMŎTHĔTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νομόθεται</span>), movers or
proposers of laws, the name of a legislative
committee at Athens, which, by an institution
of Solon, was appointed to amend and revise
the laws. At the first <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυρία ἐκκλησία</span> in every
year, any person was at liberty to point out
defects in the existing code or propose alterations.
If his motion was deemed worthy of
attention, the third assembly might refer the
matter to the Nomothetae. They were selected
by lot from the Heliastic body; it
being the intention of Solon to limit the
power of the popular assembly by means of a
superior board emanating from itself, composed
of citizens of mature age, bound by a
stricter oath, and accustomed to weigh legal
principles by the exercise of their judicial
functions. The number of the committee so
appointed varied according to the exigency
of the occasion. The people appointed five
advocates (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνδικοι</span>) to attend before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
board and maintain the policy of the existing
institution. If the proposed measure met
the approval of the committee, it passed into
law forthwith. Besides this, the Thesmothetae
were officially authorised to review
the whole code, and to refer to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nomothetae</i>
all statutes which they considered
unworthy of being retained. Hence appears
the difference between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psephisma</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ψήφισμα</span>)
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nomos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμος</span>). The mere resolution of
the people in assembly was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">psephisma</i>, and
only remained in force a year, like a decree
of the senate. Nothing was a <em>law</em> that did
not pass the ordeal of the Nomothetae.</p>


<p id="Nonae">NŌNAE. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Calendarium">Calendarium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Nota">NŎTA, which signified a mark or sign of
any kind, was also employed for an abbreviation.
Hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">notae</i> signified the marks or
signs used in taking down the words of a
speaker, and was equivalent to our short-hand
writing, or stenography; and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">notarii</i>
signified short-hand writers. It must be
borne in mind, however, that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">notae</i> also signified
writing in cipher; and many passages
in the ancient reciters which are supposed to
refer to short-hand, refer in reality to writing
in cipher. Among the Greeks it is said to
have been invented by Xenophon, and their
short-hand writers were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταχυγράφοι</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀξυγράφοι</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σημειογράφοι</span>. The first introduction
of the art among the Romans is ascribed
to Cicero. He is said to have caused
the debate in the senate on the punishment
of the Catilinarian conspirators to be taken
down in short-hand. Eusebius ascribes it to
Tiro, the freedman of Cicero, and hence the
system of abbreviated writing, in which
some manuscripts are written, has received
the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Notae Tironianae</i>; but there is
no evidence to show whether this species of
short-hand was really the invention of Tiro.
The system of short-hand employed in the
time of the Roman empire must have been of
a much simpler and more expeditious kind
than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Notae Tironianae</i>, which were
merely abbreviations of the words. Many of
the wealthy Romans kept slaves, who were
trained in the art. It was also learnt even
by the Roman nobles, and the emperor Titus
was a great proficient in it. At a later time,
it seems to have been generally taught in the
schools. There were, moreover, short-hand
writers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">notarii</i>) by profession, who were
chiefly employed in taking down (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">notare</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">excipere</i>)
the proceedings in the courts of justice.
At a later period, they were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exceptores</i>.
These short-hand writers were also employed
on some occasions to take down a person’s
will.</p>


<p id="Notarii">NOTĀRĬI, short-hand writers, spoken of
under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Nota">Nota</a></span>. They were likewise called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actuarii</i>.
They were also employed by the
emperors, and in course of time the title of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Notarii</i> was exclusively applied to the private
secretaries of the emperors, who, of course,
were no longer slaves, but persons of high
rank. The short-hand writers were now
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exceptores</i>, as is remarked under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Nota">Nota</a></span>.</p>

<p id="Novendiale">NŎVENDĬĀLE (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacrum</i>).&mdash;(1) A festival
lasting nine days, which was celebrated
as often as stones rained from heaven. It
was originally instituted by Tullus Hostilius,
when there was a shower of stones upon the
Mons Albanus, and was frequently celebrated
in later times.&mdash;(2) This name was also given
to the sacrifice performed nine days after a
funeral. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a>.</span>]</p>

<p id="Nudus">NŪDUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνός</span>). These words, besides
denoting absolute nakedness, were applied to
any one who, being without an <span class="smcap"><a href="#Amictus">Amictus</a></span>,
wore only his tunic or indutus. In this state
of nudity the ancients performed the operations
of ploughing, sowing, and reaping.
This term applied to the warrior expressed
the absence of some part of his armour.
Hence the light-armed were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γυμνῆτες</span>.

<p id="Nundinae">NUNDĬNAE is derived by all the ancient
writers from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novem</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies</i>, so that it
literally signifies the ninth day. Every eighth
day, according to our mode of speaking, was
a nundinae, and there were thus always seven
ordinary days between two nundinae. The
Romans in their peculiar mode of reckoning
added these two nundinae to the seven ordinary
days, and consequently said that the
nundinae recurred every ninth day, and
called them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i>, as it were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novemdinae</i>.
The number of nundinae in the ancient year
of ten months was 38. They were originally
market-days for the country folk, on which
they came to Rome to sell the produce of
their labour, and on which the king settled
the legal disputes among them. When,
therefore, we read that the nundinae were
feriae, or dies nefasti, and that no comitia
were allowed to be held, we have to understand
this of the populus or patricians, and
not of the plebes; and while for the populus
the nundinae were feriae, they were real
days of business (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies fasti</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitiales</i>) for
the plebeians, who on these occasions pleaded
their causes with members of their own order,
and held their public meetings (the ancient
comitia of the plebeians). Afterwards the
nundinae became fasti for both orders, and
this innovation facilitated the attendance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
the plebeians at the comitia centuriata. The
subjects to be laid before the comitia, whether
they were proposals for new laws, or the
appointment of officers, were announced to
the people three nundinae beforehand (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trinundino
die proponere</i>). Instead of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinae</i>
the form <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nundinum</i> is sometimes used, but
only when it is preceded by a numeral, as in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trinundinum</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trinum nundinum</i>.</p>

bending of the knees, the greaves are seen to

were used to fasten the greaves immediately

<p id="Odeum">ŌDĒUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ᾠδεῖον</span>), a species of public building
for contests in vocal and instrumental
music. In its general form and arrangements
it was very similar to the theatre; and it is
sometimes called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέατρον</span>. There were,
however, some characteristic differences: the
Odeum was much smaller than the theatre;
and it was roofed over, in order to retain the
sound. The earliest building of this kind
was that erected by Pericles at Athens, for
the purpose of celebrating the musical contests
at the Panathenaea. Its proximity to
the theatre suggested some of the uses made
of it, namely, as a refuge for the audience
when driven out of the theatre by rain, and
also as a place in which the chorus could be
prepared. Another Odeum was built at Athens
by Herodes Atticus, and was the most magnificent
edifice of the sort in the whole empire.
The length of its largest diameter was 248
feet, and it is calculated to have furnished
accommodation for about 8000 persons.
There were also Odea in other Greek towns.
The first Odeum, properly so called, at Rome,
was built by Domitian, and the second by
Trajan. There are ruins of such buildings in
the villa of Hadrian at Tivoli, at Pompeii,
and at Catana.</p>


<p id="Olea">ŎLĔA, ŎLĪVA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλαία</span>); ŎLĔUM, OLĪVUM
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔλαιον</span>). The importance of the olive
was recognised from the most remote period
of antiquity in all civilised countries where
the temperature admitted of its cultivation:
and it was widely adopted as an emblem
of industry and peace. Hence the honour
paid to it at Athens, and hence the title
of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima omnium arborum</span>,” bestowed upon
it by Columella. The fruit (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bacca</i>) of the
olive was for the most part employed for
one of two purposes. 1. It was eaten as a
fruit, either fresh, pickled, or preserved in
various ways. 2. It was pressed so as to
yield the oil and other juices which it contained.
And again, the oil was employed for
a variety of purposes, but chiefly 1. As an
article of food. 2. For anointing the body, and
in this case was frequently made a vehicle
for perfumes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unguenta</i>). 3. For burning in
lamps.</p>


<p id="Oligarchia">OLĬGARCHĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγαρχια</span>), the government
of a few: a term applied to that perversion
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρέκβασις</span>) of an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aristocratia</i> into
which the latter passed, when, owing to the rise
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demus</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Democratia">Democratia</a></span>], and the vanishing
of those substantial grounds of pre-eminence
which rendered an Aristocratia not unjust,
the rule of the dominant portion of the community
became the ascendancy of a faction,
whose efforts were directed chiefly towards
their own aggrandisement. The preservation
of power under such circumstances of course
depended chiefly upon the possession of superior
wealth and the other appliances of
wealth which were its concomitants. Thus
it came to be regarded as essentially characteristic
of an oligarchy, that the main distinction
between the dominant faction and
the subject portion of the community was
the possession of greater wealth on the part
of the former. Hence the term <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oligarchia</i>
would not have been applied, if a small section
of the community, consisting of <em>poor</em>
persons, by any means got the reins of government
into their hands.</p>

<p id="Olympia">ŎLYMPĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀλύμπια</span>), the Olympic games,
the greatest of the national festivals of the
Greeks. It was celebrated at Olympia in
Elis, the name given to a small plain to the
west of Pisa, which was bounded on the
north and north-east by the mountains Cronius
and Olympus, on the south by the river
Alpheus, and on the west by the Cladeus,
which flows into the Alpheus. Olympia does
not appear to have been a town, but rather a
collection of temples and public buildings.
The origin of the Olympic games is buried in
obscurity, but the festival was of very great
antiquity. The first historical fact connected
with this festival is its revival by Iphitus,
king of Elis, who is said to have accomplished
it with the assistance of Lycurgus, the
Spartan lawgiver, and Cleosthenes of Pisa.
The date of this event is given by some
writers as <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 884, and by others as <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 828.
The interval of four years between each celebration
of the festival was called an Olympiad;
but the Olympiads were not employed
as a chronological aera till the victory of
Coroebus in the foot-race, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 776. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Olympias">Olympias</a>.</span>]
The most important point in the
renewal of the festival by Iphitus was the
establishment of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ececheiria</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκεχειρία</span>),
or sacred armistice. The proclamation was
made by peace-heralds (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σπονδοφόροι</span>), first in
Elis and afterwards in the other parts of
Greece; it put a stop to all warfare for the
month in which the games were celebrated,
and which was called the <em>sacred month</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερομηνία</span>).
The territory of Elis itself was considered
especially sacred during the games,
and no armed force could enter it without
incurring the guilt of sacrilege. The
Olympic festival was probably confined at
first to the Peloponnesians; but as its celebrity
extended, the other Greeks took part
in it, till at length it became a festival for
the whole nation. No one was allowed to
contend in the games but persons of pure
Hellenic blood: barbarians might be spectators,
but slaves were entirely excluded.
After the conquest of Greece by the Romans,
the latter were permitted to take part in the
games. No women were allowed to be present
or even to cross the Alpheus during
the celebration of the games, under penalty
of being hurled down from the Typaean
rock, but women could send chariots to
the races. The number of spectators at the
festival was very great; and these were
drawn together not merely by the desire of
seeing the games, but partly through the
opportunity it afforded them of carrying on
commercial transactions with persons from
distant places, as is the case with the Mohammedan
festivals at Mecca and Medina.
Many of the persons present were also deputies
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωροί</span>) sent to represent the various
states of Greece; and we find that these
embassies vied with one another in the number
of their offerings, and the splendour of
their general appearance, in order to support
the honour of their native cities. The
Olympic festival was a Pentaëteris (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πενταετηρίς</span>),
that is, according to the ancient mode
of reckoning, a space of four years elapsed
between each festival, in the same way as
there was only a space of two years between
a Trieteris. It was celebrated on the first
full moon after the summer solstice. It
lasted, after all the contests had been introduced,
five days, from the 11th to the 15th
days of the month inclusive. The fourth day
of the festival was the 14th of the month,
which was the day of the full moon, and
which divided the month into two equal
parts. The festival was under the immediate
superintendence of the Olympian Zeus, whose
temple at Olympia, adorned with the statue
of the god made by Phidias, was one of the
most splendid works of art in Greece. There
were also temples and altars to most of the
other gods. The festival itself may be divided
into two parts, the games or contests
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν Ολυμπιακός</span>), and the festive rites
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑορτή</span>) connected with the sacrifices, with the
processions, and with the public banquets in
honour of the conquerors.&mdash;The contests consisted
of various trials of strength and skill,
which were increased in number from time
to time. There were in all twenty-four contests,
eighteen in which men took part, and
six in which boys engaged, though they were
never all exhibited at one festival, since some
were abolished almost immediately after their
institution, and others after they had been in
use only a short time. We subjoin a list of
these from Pausanias, with the date of the
introduction of each, commencing from the
Olympiad of Coroebus:&mdash;1. The foot-race
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρόμος</span>), which was the only contest during
the first 13 Olympiads. 2. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίαυλος</span>, or
foot-race, in which the stadium was traversed
twice, first introduced in Ol. 14. 3. The
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόλιχος</span>, a still longer foot-race than the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίαυλος</span>, introduced in Ol. 15. For a more
particular account of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίαυλος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόλιχος</span>,
see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Stadium">Stadium</a></span>. 4. Wrestling (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάλη</span>), and, 5.
The Pentathlum (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πένταθλον</span>), which consisted
of five exercises [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pentathlon">Pentathlum</a></span>], both introduced
in Ol. 18. 6. Boxing (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυγμή</span>) introduced
in Ol. 23. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pugilatus">Pugilatus</a>.</span>] 7. The chariot-race,
with four full-grown horses (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἵππων τελείων
δρόμος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅρμα</span>), introduced in Ol. 25. 8. The
Pancratium (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παγκράτιον</span>) [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pancratium">Pancratium</a></span>], and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
9. The horse-race (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἵππος κέλης</span>), both introduced
in Ol. 33. 10 and 11. The foot-race
and wrestling for boys, both introduced in
Ol. 37. 12. The Pentathlum for boys, introduced
in Ol. 38., but immediately afterwards
abolished. 13. Boxing for boys, introduced
in Ol. 41. 14. The foot-race, in
which men ran with the equipments of heavy-armed
soldiers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τῶν ὁπλιτῶν δρόμος</span>), introduced
in Ol. 65., on account of its training men for
actual service in war. 15. The chariot-race
with mules (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπήνη</span>), introduced in Ol. 70.;
and 16. The horse-race with mares (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλπη</span>),

The Pancratium for boys, introduced in Ol.
145. 24. There was also a horse-race (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἵππος

know the time of its introduction.&mdash;The judges
in the Olympic Games, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hellanodicae</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑλλανοδίκαι</span>), were appointed by the Eleans,
who had the regulation of the whole festival.
It appears to have been originally under the
superintendence of Pisa, in the neighbourhood
of which Olympia was situated, but after the
conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians on
the return of the Heraclidae, the Aetolians,
who had been of great assistance to the Heraclidae,
settled in Elis, and from this time
the Aetolian Eleans obtained the regulation of
the festival, and appointed the presiding
officers. The Hellanodicae were chosen by
lot from the whole body of the Eleans. Their
number varied at different periods, but at a
later time there were eight Hellanodicae.
Their office probably lasted for only one festival.
They had to see that all the laws
relating to the games were observed by the
competitors and others, to determine the
prizes, and to give them to the conquerors.
An appeal lay from their decision to the
Elean senate. Under the direction of the
Hellanodicae was a certain number of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alytae</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλύται</span>) with an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alytarches</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀλυτάρχης</span>) at
their head, who formed a kind of police, and
carried into execution the commands of the
Hellanodicae. There were also various other
minor officers under the control of the Hellanodicae.&mdash;All
free Greeks were allowed to
contend in the games, who had complied with
the rules prescribed to candidates. The equestrian
contests were necessarily confined to
the wealthy; but the poorest citizens could
contend in the athletic games. This, however,
was far from degrading the games in
public opinion; and some of the noblest as
well as meanest citizens of the state took
part in these contests. The owners of the
chariots and horses were not obliged to contend
in person; and the wealthy vied with
one another in the number and magnificence
of the chariots and horses which they sent to
the games. All persons, who were about to
contend, had to prove to the Hellanodicae
that they were freemen, and of pure Hellenic
blood, that they had not been branded with
atimia, nor guilty of any sacrilegious act.
They further had to prove that they had
undergone the preparatory training (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προγυμνάσματα</span>)
for ten months previous. All competitors
were obliged, thirty days before the
festival, to undergo certain exercises in the
Gymnasium at Elis, under the superintendence
of the Hellanodicae. The competitors
took their places by lot. The herald then
proclaimed the name and country of each
competitor. When they were all ready to
begin the contest, the judges exhorted them
to acquit themselves nobly, and then gave the
signal to commence.&mdash;The only prize given
to the conqueror was a garland of wild olive
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κότινος</span>), cut from a sacred olive tree, which
grew in the sacred grove of Altis in Olympia.
The victor was originally crowned upon a
tripod covered over with bronze, but afterwards
upon a table made of ivory and gold.
Palm branches, the common tokens of victory
on other occasions, were placed in his hands.
The name of the victor, and that of his father
and of his country, were then proclaimed by
a herald before the representatives of assembled
Greece. The festival ended with processions
and sacrifices, and with a public
banquet given by the Eleans to the conquerors
in the Prytaneium. The most powerful states
considered an Olympic victory, gained by one
of their citizens, to confer honour upon the
state to which he belonged; and a conqueror
usually had immunities and privileges conferred
upon him by the gratitude of his
fellow-citizens. On his return home the
victor entered the city in a triumphal procession,
in which his praises were celebrated,
frequently in the loftiest strains of poetry.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Athletae">Athletae</a>.</span>] As persons from all parts of
the Hellenic world were assembled together
at the Olympic Games, it was the best opportunity
which the artist and the writer possessed
of making their works known. It
answered, to some extent, the same purpose
as the press does in modern times. Before
the invention of printing, the reading of
an author’s works to as large an assembly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
as could be obtained, was one of the easiest
and surest modes of publishing them; and
this was a favourite practice of the Greeks
and Romans. Accordingly we find many
instances of literary works thus published at
the Olympic festival. Herodotus is said to
have read his history at this festival; but
though there are some reasons for doubting
the correctness of this statement, there are
numerous other writers who thus published
their works, as the sophist Hippias, Prodicus
of Ceos, Anaximenes, the orator Lysias, Dion
Chrysostom, &amp;c. It must be borne in mind
that these recitations were not contests, and
that they formed properly no part of the
festival. In the same way painters and other
artists exhibited their works at Olympia.</p>


<p id="Olympias">OLYMPĬAS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀλυμπιάς</span>), an Olympiad, the
most celebrated chronological aera among
the Greeks, was the period of four years
which elapsed between each celebration of
the Olympic Games. The Olympiads began
to be reckoned from the victory of Coroebus
in the foot-race, which happened in the year
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 776. Timaeus of Sicily, however, who
flourished <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 264, was the first writer who
regularly arranged events according to the
conquerors in each Olympiad. His practice
of recording events by Olympiads was followed
by Polybius, Diodorus Siculus, Dionysius
of Halicarnassus, &amp;c. The writers who
make use of the aera of the Olympiads,
usually give the number of the Olympiad
(the first corresponding to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 776), and then
the name of the conqueror in the foot-race.
Some writers also speak of events as happening
in the first, second, third, or fourth year,
as the case may be, of a certain Olympiad;
but others do not give the separate years of
each Olympiad. The rules for converting
Olympiads into the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>,
are given under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Chronologia">Chronologia</a></span>; but as this
is troublesome, the student will find at the
end of the book a list of the Olympiads, with
the years of the Christian aera corresponding
to them from the beginning of the Olympiads
to <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 301. To save space, the separate
years of each Olympiad, with the corresponding
years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, are only given from the 47th
to the 126th Olympiad, as this is the most
important period of Grecian history; in the
other Olympiads the first year only is
given. In consulting the table it must be
borne in mind that the Olympic Games were
celebrated about midsummer, and that the
Attic year commenced at about the same
time. If, therefore, an event happened in
the second half of the Attic year, the year
B.C. must be reduced by 1. Thus Socrates
was put to death in the 1st year of the
95th Olympiad, which corresponds in the
table to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 400; but as his death happened
in Thargelion, the 11th month of the Attic
year, the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> must be reduced by 1,
which gives us <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 399, the true date of his
death.</p>


<p id="Opalia">ŎPĀLĬA, a Roman festival in honour of
Opis, celebrated on the 19th of December,
being the third day of the Saturnalia. It was
believed that Opis was the wife of Saturnus,
and for this reason the festivals were celebrated
at the same time.</p>


<p id="Opsonium">OPSŌNĬUM, or OBSŌNĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄψον</span>, <em>dim.</em>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀψάριον</span>; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀψήμα</span>), denoted everything which
was eaten with bread, the principal substance
of every meal. Those numerous articles of
diet called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opsonia</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulmentaria</i> were designed
to give nutriment, but still more to
add a relish to food. Some of these articles
were taken from the vegetable kingdom, but
were much more pungent and savoury than
bread, such as olives, either fresh or pickled,
radishes, and sesamum. Of animal food by
much the most common kind was fish, whence
the terms under explanation were in the
course of time used in a confined and special
sense to denote fish only, but fish variously
prepared, and more especially salt fish, which
was most extensively employed to give a
relish to the vegetable diet. The Athenians
were in the habit of going to markets (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰς
τοῦψον</span>) themselves in order to purchase their
opsonia (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀψωνεῖν</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opsonare</i>). But the opulent,
Romans had a slave, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opsonator</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀψώνης</span>),
whose office it was to purchase for his master.</p>

<p id="Oraculum">ŌRĀCŬLUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μαντεῖον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρηστήριον</span>) was
used by the ancients to designate both the
revelations made by the deity to man, as well
as the place in which such revelations were
made. The deity was in none of these places
believed to appear in person to man, and to
communicate to him his will or knowledge
of the future, but all oracular revelations
were made through some kind of medium,
which was different in the different places
where oracles existed. It may, at first sight,
seem strange that there were, comparatively
speaking, so few oracles of Zeus, the father
and ruler of gods and men. But although,
according to the belief of the ancients, Zeus
himself was the first source of all oracular
revelations, yet he was too far above men to
enter with them into any close relation;
other gods therefore, especially Apollo, and
even heroes, acted as mediators between Zeus
and men, and were, as it were, the organs
through which he communicated his will.
The ancients consulted the will of the gods
on all important occasions of public and private
life, since they were unwilling to undertake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
anything of importance without their
sanction.&mdash;The most celebrated oracle was
that of Apollo at Delphi. Its ancient name
was Pytho. In the centre of the temple
there was a small opening (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χάσμα</span>) in the
ground, from which, from time to time, an
intoxicating smoke arose, which was believed
to come from the well of Cassotis, which
vanished into the ground close by the sanctuary.
Over this chasm there stood a high
tripod, on which the Pythia, led into the
temple by the prophetes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προφήτης</span>), took her
seat whenever the oracle was to be consulted.
The smoke rising from under the tripod
affected her brain in such a manner that she
fell into a state of delirious intoxication, and
the sounds which she uttered in this state
were believed to contain the revelations of
Apollo. These sounds were carefully written
down by the prophetes, and afterwards communicated
to the persons who had come to
consult the oracle. The Pythia (the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προφῆτις</span>)
was always a native of Delphi, and when she
had once entered the service of the god she
never left it, and was never allowed to marry.
In early times she was always a young girl,
but subsequently no one was elected as prophetess
who had not attained the age of fifty
years. The Delphians, or, more properly
speaking, the noble families of Delphi, had
the superintendence of the oracle. Among
the Delphian aristocracy, however, there
were five families which traced their origin
to Deucalion, and from each of these one of
the five priests, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hosioi</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅσιοι</span>), was
taken. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hosioi</i>, together with the high-priest
or prophetes, held their offices for life,
and had the control of all the affairs of the
sanctuary and of the sacrifices. That these
noble families had an immense influence upon
the oracle is manifest from numerous instances,
and it is not improbable that they
were its very soul, and that it was they who
dictated the pretended revelations of the god.
Most of the oracular answers which are
extant are in hexameters, and in the Ionic
dialect. Sometimes, however, Doric forms
also were used.&mdash;No religious institution in
all antiquity obtained such a paramount influence
in Greece as the oracle of Delphi.
When consulted on a subject of a religious
nature, the answer was invariably of a kind
calculated not only to protect and preserve
religious institutions, but to command new
ones to be established, so that it was the preserver
and promoter of religion throughout
the ancient world. Colonies were seldom or
never founded without having obtained the
advice and the directions of the Delphic god.
The Delphic oracle had at all times a leaning
in favour of the Greeks of the Doric race,
but the time when it began to lose its influence
must be dated from the period when
Athens and Sparta entered upon their struggle
for the supremacy in Greece; for at this time
the partiality for Sparta became so manifest
that the Athenians and their party began to
lose all reverence and esteem for it, and the
oracle became a mere instrument in the hands
of a political party. Of the other oracles, the
most celebrated were that of Apollo at Didyma,
usually called the oracle of the Branchidae,
in the territory of Miletus; that of Zeus, at
Dodona, where the oracle was given from
sounds produced by the wind; that of Zeus
Ammon, in an oasis in Libya, not far from
the boundaries of Egypt; that of Amphiaraus,
between Potniae and Thebes, where the hero
was said to have been swallowed up by the
earth; and that of Trophonius, at Lebadeia
in Boeotia.</p>


<p id="Orarium">ŌRĀRĬUM was a small handkerchief used
for wiping the face, and appears to have been
employed for much the same purposes as our
pocket-handkerchief. It was made of silk or
linen. Aurelian introduced the practice of
giving <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oraria</i> to the Roman people to use
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad favorem</i>, which appears to mean for the
purpose of waving in the public games in
token of applause.</p>


<p id="Orator">ŌRĀTOR. The profession of the Roman
orator, who with reference to his undertaking
a client’s case is also called patronus, was
quite distinct from that of the Jurisconsultus
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Jurisconsulti">Jurisconsulti</a></span>], and also from that of the
Advocatus, at least in the time of Cicero, and
even later. An orator who possessed a competent
knowledge of the Jus Civile would,
however, have an advantage. Some requisites
of oratory, such as voice and gesture,
could only be acquired by discipline, whereas
a competent knowledge of the law of a case
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">juris utilitas</i>) could be got at any time from
the jurisconsulti (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">periti</i>) or from books.
Oratory was a serious study among the Romans.
Cicero tells us by what painful labour
he attained to excellence. Roman oratory
reached its perfection in the century which
preceded the Christian aera. Its decline dates
from the establishment of the Imperial power.
The old orators learned their art by constant
attendance on some eminent orator and by
actual experience of business: the orators of
Messala’s time were formed in the schools of
Rhetoric, and their powers were developed
in exercises on fictitious matters. But the
immediate causes of the former nourishing
condition of eloquence were the political power
which oratory conferred on the orator under
the Republic, and the party struggles and
even the violence that are incident to such a
state of society.</p>

<p id="Ordo">ORDO is applied to any body of men who
form a distinct class in the community, either
by possessing distinct privileges, pursuing certain
trades or professions, or in any other
way. Thus the whole body of sacerdotes at
Rome is spoken of as an ordo, and separate
ecclesiastical corporations are called by the
same title. The libertini and scribae also
formed separate ordines. The senate and
the equites are also spoken of respectively as
the ordo senatorius and ordo equestris, but
this name is never applied to the plebes. Accordingly
we find the expression, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">uterque
ordo</i>, used without any further explanation
to designate the senatorial and equestrian
ordines. The senatorial ordo, as the highest,
is sometimes distinguished as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amplissimus
ordo</i>.&mdash;The senate in colonies and municipia
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordo decurionum</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Colonia">Colonia</a></span>], and
sometimes simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordo</i>.&mdash;The term ordo is
also applied to a company or troop of soldiers,
and is used as equivalent to centuria: thus
centurions are sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui ordines
duxerunt</i>, and the first centuries in a legion
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primi ordines</i>. Even the centurions of the first
centuries are occasionally called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primi ordines</i>.</p>

<p id="Orichalcum">ŎRĬCHALCUM, a metallic compound, akin

with copper, although they appear to
have had scarcely any knowledge of zinc
as a metal. The word is derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄρος</span>

an Attic festival, which, according to some
writers, was celebrated in honour of Athena
and Dionysus, and according to others in
honour of Dionysus and Ariadne. It is said
to have been instituted by Theseus. It was
a vintage festival, and its name is derived
from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὦσχος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄσχος</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄσχη</span>, a branch of vines

<p id="Ovatio">ŎVĀTĬO, a lesser triumph. The circumstances
by which it was distinguished from
the more imposing solemnity [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Triumphus">Triumphus</a></span>]
were the following:&mdash;The general did not
enter the city in a chariot drawn by four
horses, but on foot: he was not arrayed in
the gorgeous gold-embroidered robe, but in
the simple toga praetexta of a magistrate;
his brows were encircled with a wreath, not
of laurel but of myrtle; he bore no sceptre
in his hand; the procession was not heralded
by trumpets, headed by the senate, and
thronged with victorious troops, but was
enlivened by a crowd of flute players, attended
chiefly by knights and plebeians, frequently
without soldiers: the ceremonies
were concluded by the sacrifice, not of a bull
but of a sheep. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ovatio</i> seems
clearly to be derived from the kind of victim
offered. An ovation was granted when the
advantage gained, although considerable, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
not sufficient to constitute a legitimate claim
to the higher distinction of a triumph, or
when the victory had been achieved with
little bloodshed; or when hostilities had not
been regularly proclaimed; or when the war
had not been completely terminated; or when
the contest had been carried on against base
and unworthy foes; and hence when the
servile bands of Athenion and Spartacus were
destroyed by Perperna and Crassus, these
leaders celebrated ovations only.</p>

song, which was originally sung in
honour of Apollo. It was always of a joyous
nature, and its tune and sounds expressed
hope and confidence. It was a song of
thanksgiving, when danger was passed, and
also a hymn to propitiate the god. It was
sung at the solemn festivals of Apollo, and
especially at the Hyacinthia. The paean
was also sung as a battle-song, both before
an attack on the enemy and after the battle
was finished. It is certain that the paean
was in later times sung to the honour of
other gods besides Apollo. Thus Xenophon
relates that the Greek army in Asia sung a
paean to Zeus.</p>


<p id="Paedagogus">PAEDĂGŌGUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παιδαγωγός</span>), a tutor. The

trustworthy of the slaves. The sons of his
master were committed to his care on attaining
their sixth or seventh year, their previous
education having been conducted by females.
They remained with the tutor until they attained
the age of puberty. His duty was
rather to guard them from evil, both physical
and moral, than to communicate instruction.
He went with them to and from the school
or the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Gymnasium">Gymnasium</a></span>; he accompanied them
out of doors on all occasions; he was responsible

<p id="Pagi">PĀGI were fortified places in the neighbourhood
of Rome, to which the country-people
might retreat in case of a hostile
inroad. Each of the country tribes is said to
have been divided by Numa into a certain
number of pagi; which name was given to
the country adjoining the fortified village, as
well as to the village itself. There was a
magistrate at the head of each pagus, who
kept a register of the names and of the property
of all persons in the pagus, raised the
taxes, and summoned the people, when necessary,
to war. Each pagus had its own
sacred rites, and an annual festival called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paganalia</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pagani</i>, or inhabitants of
the pagi, had their regular meetings, at
which they passed resolutions. The division
of the country-people into pagi continued to
the latest times of the Roman empire. The
term Pagani is often used in opposition to
milites, and is applied to all who were not
soldiers, even though they did not live in the
country. The Christian writers gave the
name of pagani to those persons who adhered
to the old Roman religion, because the
latter continued to be generally believed by
the country-people, after Christianity became
the prevailing religion of the inhabitants of
the towns.</p>


<p id="Palaestra">PĂLAESTRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλαίστρα</span>), properly means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
a place for wrestling (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλαίειν</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάλη</span>), and
appears to have originally formed a part of
the gymnasium. At Athens, however, there
was a considerable number of palaestrae,
quite distinct from the gymnasia. It appears
most probable that the palaestrae were
chiefly appropriated to the exercises of wrestling
and of the pancratium, and were principally
intended for the athletae, who, it
must be recollected, were persons that contended
in the public games, and therefore
needed special training. The Romans had
originally no places corresponding to the
Greek gymnasia and palaestrae; and when
towards the close of the republic wealthy
Romans, in imitation of the Greeks, began to
build places for exercise in their villas, they
called them indifferently gymnasia and palaestrae.</p>


<p id="Palilia">PĂLĪLIA, a festival celebrated at Rome
every year on the 21st of April, in honour of
Pales, the tutelary divinity of shepherds.
The 21st of April was the day on which,
according to the early traditions of Rome,
Romulus had commenced the building of the
city, so that the festival was at the same
time solemnised as the dies natalitius of
Rome. It was originally a shepherd-festival,
and continued to be so among country people
till the latest times, but in the city it lost its
original character, and was only regarded as
the dies natalitius of Rome. The first part of
the solemnities was a public purification by
fire and smoke. The things burnt in order
to produce this purifying smoke were the
blood of the <em>October-horse</em>, the ashes of the
calves sacrificed at the festival of Ceres, and
the shells of beans. The people were also
sprinkled with water, they washed their
hands in spring-water, and drank milk mixed
with must. As regards the <em>October-horse</em>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equus October</i>) it must be observed that in
early times no bloody sacrifice was allowed
to be offered at the palilia, and the blood of
the October-horse mentioned above, was the
blood which had dropped from the tail of the
horse sacrificed in the month of October to
Mars in the Campus Martius. This blood
was preserved by the vestal virgins in the
temple of Vesta for the purpose of being used
at the palilia. The sacrifices consisted of
cakes, millet, milk, and other kinds of eatables.
The shepherds then offered a prayer
to Pales. After these solemn rites were over,
the cheerful part of the festival began: bonfires
were made of heaps of hay and straw,
and the festival was concluded by a feast in
the open air, at which the people sat or lay
upon benches of turf, and drank plentifully.</p>


<p id="Pallium">PALLĬUM, <em>dim.</em> PALLIŎLUM, <em>poet.</em>
PALLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον</span>, <em>dim.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱματίδιον</span>; <em>Ion.</em> and
<em>poet.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φᾶρος</span>), an outer garment. The English
<em>cloak</em>, though commonly adopted as the translation
of these terms, conveys no accurate
conception of the form, material, or use of
that which they denoted. The article designated
by them was always a rectangular
piece of cloth, exactly, or at least nearly
square. It was indeed used in the very form
in which it was taken from the loom, being
made entirely by the weaver, without any
aid from the tailor, except to repair the injuries
which it sustained by time. Whatever
additional richness and beauty it received
from the art of the dyer, was bestowed upon
it before its materials were woven into cloth
or even spun into thread. Most commonly it
was used without having undergone any process
of this kind. The raw material, such as
wool, flax, or cotton, was manufactured in
its natural state, and hence pallia were commonly
white, although from the same cause
brown, drab, and grey were also prevailing
colours. As the pallium was the most common
outer garment, we find it continually
mentioned in conjunction with the tunica,
which constituted the indutus. Such phrases
as “coat and waistcoat,” or “shoes and stockings,”
are not more common with us than the
following expressions, which constantly occur
in ancient authors: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tunica palliumque</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱμάτιον
καὶ χιτών</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἱμάτιον καὶ ὁ χιτωνίσκος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φᾶρος
ἠδὲ χιτών</span>, &amp;c. To wear the pallium without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
the underclothing indicated poverty or severity
of manners, as in the case of Socrates.
One of the most common modes of wearing
the pallium was to fasten it with a brooch
over the right shoulder, leaving the right
arm at liberty, and to pass the middle of it
either under the left arm so as to leave that
arm at liberty also, or over the left shoulder
so as to cover the left arm. The figure in
the preceding cut is attired in the last-mentioned
fashion.</p>

<p id="Palmipes">PALMĬPES, a Roman measure of length,
equal to a foot and a palm.</p>


<p id="Palmus">PALMUS, properly the width of the open
hand, or, more exactly, of the four fingers,
was used by the Romans for two different
measures of length, namely, as the translation
of the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παλαιστή</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῶρον</span> in old
Greek, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σπιθαμή</span> respectively. In the
former sense it is equal to 4 digits, or 3
inches, or 1-4th of a foot, or 1-6th of the
cubit. The larger palm of 9 inches only
occurs in later Roman writers. From this large
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palmus</i> the modern Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palmo</i> is derived.</p>

<p id="Paludamentum">PĂLŪDĀMENTUM, the cloak worn by a

principal officers and personal attendants, in
contradistinction to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sagum</i> of the common
soldiers, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga</i> or garb of peace. It
was the practice for a Roman magistrate,
after he had received the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium</i> from the
comitia curiata and offered up his vows in the
Capitol, to march out of the city arrayed in
the paludamentum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exire paludatus</i>), attended
by his lictors in similar attire (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paludatis lictoribus</i>),
nor could he again enter the gates
until he had formally divested himself of this
emblem of military power. The paludamentum
was open in front, reached down to the
knees or a little lower, and hung loosely
over the shoulders, being fastened across the
chest by a clasp. The colour of the paludamentum
was commonly white or purple, and
hence it was marked and remembered that
Crassus on the morning of the fatal battle of
Carrhae went forth in a dark-coloured mantle.
In the cut below, representing the head
of a warrior, we see the paludamentum flying
back in the charge, and the clasp nearly in
front.</p>

<p id="Pamboeotia">PAMBOEŌTĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παμβοιώτια</span>), a festive panegyris
of all the Boeotians, like the Panathenaea
of the Atticans, and the Panionia of
the Ionians. The principal object of the
meeting was the common worship of Athena
Itonia, who had a temple in the neighbourhood
of Coronea, near which the panegyris
was held.</p>


<p id="Panathenaea">PĂNĂTHĒNAEA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παναθήναια</span>), the greatest
and most splendid of the festivals celebrated
in Attica in honour of Athena, in the
character of Athena Polias, or the protectress
of the city. It was said to have been instituted
by Erichthonius, and its original name,
down to the time of Theseus, was believed to
have been Athenaea; but when Theseus united
all the Atticans into one body, this festival,
which then became the common festival of
all the Attic tribes, was called Panathenaea.
There were two kinds of Panathenaea, the
greater and the lesser; the former were held
every fourth year (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πενταετηρίς</span>), the latter
every year. The lesser Panathenaea were
probably celebrated on the 17th of the month<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
Hecatombaeon; the great Panathenaea in the
third year of every Olympiad, and probably
commenced on the same day as the lesser Panathenaea.
The principal difference between
the two festivals was, that the greater one was
more solemn, and that on this occasion the
peplus of Athena was carried to her temple in
a most magnificent procession, which was not
held at the lesser Panathenaea. The solemnities,
games, and amusements of the Panathenaea
were, rich sacrifices of bulls, foot,
horse, and chariot races, gymnastic and musical
contests, and the lampadephoria; rhapsodists
recited the poems of Homer and other
epic poets, philosophers disputed, cock-fights
were exhibited, and the people indulged in a
variety of other amusements and entertainments.
The prize in these contests was a
vase filled with oil from the ancient and
sacred olive tree of Athena on the Acropolis.
A great many of such vases, called Panathenaic
vases, have in late years been found in
Etruria, southern Italy, Sicily, and Greece.
They represent on one side the figure of
Athena, and on the other the various contests
and games in which these vases were
given as prizes to the victors. Of the discussions
of philosophers and orators at the
Panathenaea we still possess two specimens,
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόγος Παναθηναικός</span> of Isocrates, and that
of Aristeides. Herodotus is said to have recited
his history to the Athenians at the
Panathenaea. The management of the games
and contests was entrusted to persons called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Athlothetae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀθλοθέται</span>), whose number was
ten, one being taken from every tribe. Their
office lasted from one great Panathenaic festival
to the other. The chief solemnity of
the great Panathenaea was the magnificent
procession to the temple of Athena Polias,
which probably took place on the last day of
the festive season. The whole of the procession
is represented in the frieze of the Parthenon,
the work of Phidias and his disciples,
now deposited in the British Museum. The
chief object of the procession was to carry the
peplus of the goddess to her temple. This peplus
was a crocus-coloured garment for the goddess,
and made by maidens, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐργαστῖναι</span>. In it
were woven Enceladus and the giants, as they
were conquered by the goddess. The peplus
was not carried to the temple by men, but
suspended from the mast of a ship. The procession
proceeded from the Ceramicus, near a
monument called Leocorium, to the temple of
Demeter at Eleusis, and thence along the
Pelasgic wall and the temple of Apollo
Pythius to the Pnyx, and thence to the
Acropolis, where the statue of Minerva Polias
was adorned with the peplus. In this procession
nearly the whole population of Attica
appears to have taken part, either on foot, on
horseback, or in chariots, as may be seen in
the frieze of the Parthenon. Aged men carried
olive branches, and were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thallophori</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θαλλοφόροι</span>); young men attended,
at least in earlier times, in armour, and
maidens who belonged to the noblest families
of Athens carried baskets, containing offerings
for the goddess, whence they were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Canephori</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κανηφόροι</span>). Respecting the part
which aliens took in this procession, and the
duties they had to perform, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Hydriaphoria">Hydriaphoria</a></span>.
Men who had deserved well of the
republic were rewarded with a gold crown at
the great Panathenaea, and the herald had to
announce the event during the gymnastic
contests.</p>

</div>


<p id="Pancratium">PANCRĂTĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παγκράτιον</span>), is derived
from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάν</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κράτος</span>, and accordingly signifies
an athletic game, in which all the powers of
the fighter were called into action. The
pancratium was one of the games or gymnastic
contests which were exhibited at all the
great festivals of Greece; it consisted of boxing
and wrestling (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυγμή</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάλη</span>), and
was reckoned to be one of the heavy or hard
exercises (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγωνίσματα βαρέα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βαρύτερα</span>), on
account of the violent exertions it required,
and for this reason it was not much practised
in the gymnasia. In Homer we find neither
the game nor the name of the pancratium
mentioned, and as it was not introduced at
the Olympic games until Ol. 33, we may
presume that the game, though it may have
existed long before in a rude state, was not
brought to any degree of perfection until a
short time before that event. The name of the
combatants was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pancratiastae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παγκρατιασταί</span>)
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pammachi</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάμμαχοι</span>). They fought
naked, and had their bodies anointed and
covered with sand, by which they were
enabled to take hold of one another. When
the contest began, each of the fighters might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
commence by boxing or by wrestling, accordingly
as he thought he should be more
successful in the one than in the other. The
victory was not decided until one of the parties
was killed, or lifted up a finger, thereby
declaring that he was unable to continue the
contest either from pain or fatigue.</p>


<p id="Panegyris">PĂNĒGỸRIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πανήγυρις</span>), signifies a meeting
or assembly of a whole people for the
purpose of worshipping at a common sanctuary.
The word is used in three significations:&mdash;1.
For a meeting of the inhabitants
of one particular town and its vicinity; 2.
For a meeting of the inhabitants of a whole
district, a province, or of the whole body of
people belonging to a particular tribe [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Delia">Delia</a></span>;
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Panionia">Panionia</a></span>]; and 3. For great national meetings,
as the Olympic, Pythian, Isthmian, and
Nemean games. Although in all panegyreis
which we know, the religious character forms
the most prominent feature, other subjects,
political discussions and resolutions, as well
as a variety of amusements, were not excluded,
though they were perhaps more a
consequence of the presence of many persons
than objects of the meeting. Every
panegyris, moreover, was made by tradespeople
a source of gain, and it may be presumed
that such a meeting was never held
without a fair, at which all sorts of things
were exhibited for sale.</p>


<p id="Panionia">PĂNIŌNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πανιώνια</span>), the great national
panegyris of the Ionians on mount Mycalé,
where the national god Poseidon Heliconius
had his sanctuary called the Panionium. One
of the principal objects of this national meeting
was the common worship of Poseidon, to
whom splendid sacrifices were offered on the
occasion. But religious worship was not the
only object for which they assembled at the
Panionium; on certain emergencies, especially
in case of any danger threatening their
country, the Ionians discussed at their meetings
political questions, and passed resolutions
which were binding upon all.</p>


<p id="Panoplia">PĂNOPLĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πανοπλία</span>), a panoply or suit
of armour. The articles of which it consisted
both in the Greek and in the Roman army,
are enumerated under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Arma">Arma</a></span>.</p>


<p id="Pantomimus">PANTŎMĪMUS, the name of a kind of
actors peculiar to the Romans, who very
nearly resembled in their mode of acting the
modern dancers in the ballet. They did not
speak on the stage, but merely acted by
gestures, movements, and attitudes. All
movements, however, were rhythmical like
those in the ballet, whence the general term
for them is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saltatio</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saltare</i>; the whole art
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">musica muta</i>; and to represent
Niobe or Leda was expressed by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saltare
Nioben</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saltare Ledam</i>. During the time
of the republic the name pantomimus does
not occur, though the art itself was known to
the Romans at an early period; for the first
histriones said to have been introduced from
Etruria were in fact nothing but pantomimic
dancers [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Histrio">Histrio</a></span>], whence we find that
under the empire the names histrio and pantomimus
were used as synonymous. The pantomimic
art, however, was not carried to any
degree of perfection until the time of Augustus.
The greatest pantomimes of this time were
Bathyllus, a freedman and favourite of Maecenas,
and Pylades and Hylas. Mythological
love-stories were from the first the favourite
subjects of the pantomimes, which were disgraced
by the most licentious scenes. In
Sicily pantomimic dances were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ballismi</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βαλλισμοί</span>), whence perhaps the modern
words ball and ballet.</p>

<p id="Paradisus">PĂRĂDĪSUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παράδεισος</span>), the name given
by the Greeks to the parks or pleasure-grounds,
which surrounded the country residences
of the Persian kings and satraps.
They were generally stocked with animals
for the chase, were full of all kinds of trees,
watered by numerous streams, and enclosed
with walls.</p>


<p id="Paragraphe">PĂRĂGRĂPHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραγραφή</span>). This word
does not exactly correspond with any term
in our language, but may without much impropriety
be called <em>a plea</em>. It is an objection
raised by the defendant to the admissibility
of the plaintiff’s action. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paragraphé</i>,
like every other answer (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιγραφή</span>) made by
the defendant to the plaintiff’s charge, was
given in writing; as the word itself implies.
If the defendant merely denied the plaintiff’s
allegations, a court was at once held for the
trial of the cause. If, however, he put in a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paragraphé</i>, a court was to be held to try the
preliminary question, whether the cause
could be brought into court or not. Upon
this previous trial the defendant was considered
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actor</i>. If he succeeded, the whole
cause was at an end; unless the objection
was only to the form of action, or some other
such technicality, in which case it might be
recommenced in the proper manner. If,
however, the plaintiff succeeded, the original
action, which in the mean time had been
suspended, was proceeded with.</p>


<p id="Paralus">PĂRĂLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάραλος</span>), and SĂLAMĪNĬA
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαλαμινία</span>). The Athenians from very early
times kept for public purposes two sacred or
state vessels, the one of which was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paralus</i>
and the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salaminia</i>: the crew of the
one bore the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραλῖται</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάραλοι</span>, and
that of the other <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαλαμίνιοι</span>. The Salaminia
was also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δηλία</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θεωρίς</span>, because it
was used to convey the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωροὶ</span> to Delos, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
which occasion the ship was adorned with
garlands by the priest of Apollo. Both
these vessels were quick-sailing triremes, and
were used for a variety of state purposes:
they conveyed theories, despatches, &amp;c. from
Athens, carried treasures from subject countries
to Athens, fetched state criminals from
foreign parts to Athens, and the like. In
battles they were frequently used as the ships
in which the admirals sailed. These vessels and
their crews were always kept in readiness to act,
in case of any necessity arising; and the crew,
although they could not for the greater part of
the year be in actual service, received their regular
pay of four oboli per day all the year
round. The names of the two ships seem to
point to a very early period of the history of
Attica, when there was no navigation except
between Attica and Salamis, for which the Salaminia
was used, and around the coast of Attica,
for which purpose the Paralus was destined.
In later times the names were retained, although
the destination of the ships was principally
to serve the purposes of religion, whence
they are frequently called the sacred ships.</p>


<p id="Paranoias">PĂRĂNOIĀS GRĂPHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρανοίας γραφή</span>).
This proceeding may be compared to our
commission of lunacy, or writ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de lunatico
inquirendo</i>. It was a suit at Athens that
might be instituted by a son or other relation
against one who, by reason of madness or
mental imbecility, had become incapable of
managing his own affairs. If the complaint
was well grounded, the court decreed that
the next heir should take possession of the
lunatic’s property, and probably also made
some provision for his being put in confinement,
or under proper care and guardianship.
The celebrated tale of Iophon, the son of
Sophocles, accusing his father of lunacy, is
related in the life of Sophocles in the <cite>Classical

an indictment at Athens for propounding
an illegal, or rather unconstitutional measure
or law. In order to check rash and hasty
legislation, the mover of any law or decree,
though he succeeded in causing it to be
passed, was still amenable to criminal justice,
if his enactment was found to be inconsistent
with other laws that remained in force, or
with the public interest. Any person might
institute against him the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ παρανόμων</span>
within a year from the passing of the law.
If he was convicted, not only did the law
become void, but any punishment might be
inflicted on him, at the discretion of the
judges before whom he was tried. A person
thrice so convicted lost the right of proposing
laws in future. The cognizance of the cause
belonged to the Thesmothetae.</p>


<p id="Parapresbeia">PĂRAPRESBEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραπρεσβεία</span>), signifies
any corrupt conduct, misfeasance, or neglect
of duty on the part of an ambassador; for
which he was liable to be called to account
and prosecuted on his return home. Demosthenes
accused Aeschines of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parapresbeia</i> on
account of his conduct in the embassy to
Philip.</p>

<p id="Parasanga">PĂRĂSANGA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ παρασάγγης</span>), a Persian
measure of length, frequently mentioned by
the Greek writers. It is still used by the
Persians, who call it <em>ferseng</em>. According to
Herodotus the parasang was equal to 30
Greek stadia. Xenophon must also have
calculated it at the same, as he says that
16,050 stadia are equal to 535 parasangs.
(16,050 ÷ 535 = 30.) Other ancient writers
give a different length for the parasang.
Modern English travellers estimate it variously
at from 3½ to 4 English miles,
which nearly agrees with the calculation of
Herodotus.</p>


<p id="Parasiti">PĂRĂSĪTI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παράσιτοι</span>) properly denotes
persons who dine with others. In the early
history of Greece the name had a very different
meaning, being given to distinguished
persons, who were appointed as assistants to
certain priests and to the highest magistrates.
Their services appear to have been rewarded
with a third of the victims sacrificed to their
respective gods. Such officers existed down
to a late period of Greek history. Solon in
his legislation called the act of giving public
meals to certain magistrates and foreign ambassadors
in the prytaneum <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρασιτεῖν</span>, and it
may be that the parasites were connected
with this institution. The class of persons
whom we call parasites was very numerous
in ancient Greece, and appears to have existed
from early times. The characteristic
features common to all parasites are importunity,
love of sensual pleasures, and above
all the desire of getting a good dinner without
paying for it. During the time of the
Roman emperors a parasite seems to have
been a constant guest at the tables of the
wealthy.</p>


<p id="Paredri">PĂRĔDRI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάρεδροι</span>). Each of the three
superior archons was at liberty to have two
assessors (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάρεδροι</span>) chosen by himself, to
assist him by advice and otherwise in the
performance of his various duties. The
assessor, like the magistrate himself, had to
undergo a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docimasia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοκιμασία</span>) in the Senate
of Five Hundred and before a judicial tribunal,
before he could be permitted to enter
upon his labours. He was also to render an
account (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐθύνη</span>) at the end of the year. The
duties of the archons, magisterial and judicial,
were so numerous, that one of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
objects of having assessors must have been to
enable them to get through their business.
From the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paredri</i> of the archons we must
distinguish those who assisted the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">euthyni</i> in
examining and auditing magistrates’ accounts.</p>

<p id="Parma">PARMA, <em>dim.</em> PARMŬLA, a round shield,
three feet in diameter, carried by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velites</i>
in the Roman army. Though small, compared
with the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Clipeus">Clipeus</a></span>, it was so strongly
made as to be a very effectual protection.
This was probably owing to the use of iron
in its frame-work. The parma was also
worn by the cavalry. We find the term
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parma</i> often applied to the target [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cetra">Cetra</a></span>],
which was also a small round shield,
and therefore very similar to the
parma.</p>

<p id="Parochi">PĂROCHI, certain people paid by
the state to supply the Roman magistrates,
ambassadors, and other official
persons, when travelling, with those
necessaries which they could not conveniently
carry with them. They existed
on all the principal stations on
the Roman roads in Italy and the
provinces, where persons were accustomed
to pass the night. Of the things
which the parochi were bound to supply,
hay, fire-wood, salt, and a certain
number of beds appear to have been
the most important.</p>


<p id="Paropsis">PĂROPSIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παροψίς</span>), any food
eaten with the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅψον</span> as the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μάζα</span>, a
kind of frumenty or soft cake, broth,
or any kind of condiment or sauce.
It was, likewise, the name of the
dish or plate, on which such food was served
up, and it is in this latter signification that the
Roman writers use the word.</p>


<p id="Parricida">PARRĬCĪDA, PARRĬCĪDĬUM. A parricida
signified originally a murderer generally,
and is hence defined to be a person
who kills another <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolo malo</i>. It afterwards
signified the murderer of a parent, and by an
ancient law such a parricide was sewed up
in a sack (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">culleus</i>), and thrown into a river.
A law of the dictator Sulla contained some
provisions against parricide, and probably
fixed the same punishment for the parricide,
as the Lex Pompeia de Parricidiis, passed in
the time of Cn. Pompeius. This law extended
the crime of parricide to the killing
of a brother, sister, uncle, aunt, and many
other relations, and enacted that he who
killed a father or mother, grandfather or
grandmother, should be punished (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">more majorum</i>)
by being whipped till he bled, sewed
up in a sack with a dog, cock, viper, and
ape, and thrown into the sea. Other parricides
were simply put to death.</p>


<p id="Passus">PASSUS, a measure of length, which consisted
of five Roman feet. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pes">Pes</a>.</span>] The
passus was not the step, or distance from
heel to heel, when the feet were at their
utmost ordinary extension, but the distance
from the point which the heel leaves to that
in which it is set down. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mille passuum</i>,
or thousand paces, was the common name of
the Roman mile. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Miliare">Milliare</a>.</span>]</p>

<p id="Patera">PĂTĔRA, <em>dim.</em> PĂTELLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φιάλη</span>), a
round plate or dish. The paterae of the
most common kind were small plates of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
common red earthenware, on which an ornamental
pattern was drawn, and which were
sometimes entirely black. The more valuable
paterae were metallic, being chiefly of
bronze; but every family, raised above poverty,
possessed one of silver, together with
a silver salt-cellar. The accompanying cut
exhibits a highly ornamented patera, made
of bronze. The view of the upper surface is
accompanied by a side-view, showing the
form and depth of the vessel.</p>

<p id="Patina">PĂTĬNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λεκάνη</span>), a basin or bowl of
earthenware, rarely of bronze or silver. The
patina was of a form intermediate between
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patera</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">olla</i>, not so flat as the
former, nor so deep as the latter. The most
frequent use of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patina</i> was in cookery.</p>


<p id="Patres">PATRES. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Patricii">Patricii</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Patria">PĂTRĬA POTESTAS. Potestas signifies
generally a power or faculty of any kind by
which we do anything. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Potestas</span>,” says
Paulus, a Roman jurist, “has several significations:
when applied to magistrates, it is
Imperium; in the case of children, it is the
patria potestas; in the case of slaves, it is
Dominium.” According to Paulus then, potestas,
as applied to magistrates, is equivalent
to imperium. Thus we find potestas
associated with the adjectives praetoria, consularis.
But potestas is applied to magistrates
who had not the imperium, as for
instance to quaestors and tribuni plebis; and
potestas and imperium are often opposed in
Cicero. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Imperium">Imperium</a>.</span>] Thus it seems that
this word potestas, like many other Roman
terms, had both a wider signification and a
narrower one. In its wider signification it
might mean all the power that was delegated
to any person by the state, whatever might
be the extent of that power. In its narrower
significations, it was on the one hand equivalent
to imperium; and on the other, it
expressed the power of those functionaries
who had not the imperium. Sometimes it
was used to express a magistratus, as a
person; and hence in the Italian language
the word podestà signifies a magistrate. Potestas
is also one of the words by which is
expressed the power that one private person
has over another, the other two being manus
and mancipium. The potestas is either dominica,
that is, ownership as exhibited in
the relation of master and slave [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Servus">Servus</a></span>];
or patria as exhibited in the relation of
father and child. The mancipium was framed
after the analogy of the potestas dominica.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mancipium">Mancipium</a>.</span>] Patria potestas then signifies
the power which a Roman father had over
the persons of his children, grandchildren,
and other descendants (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filii-familias</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">filiae-familias</i>),
and generally all the rights which
he had by virtue of his paternity. The
foundation of the patria potestas was a legal
marriage, and the birth of a child gave it
full effect. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Matrimonium">Matrimonium</a>.</span>] It does not
seem that the patria potestas was ever
viewed among the Romans as absolutely
equivalent to the dominica potestas, or as
involving ownership of the child; and yet
the original notion of the patria came very
near to that of the dominica potestas. Originally
the father had the power of life and
death over his son as a member of his familia;
and he could sell him, and so bring him
into the mancipii causa. He could also give
his daughter in marriage, or give a wife to
his son, divorce his child, give him in adoption,
and emancipate him at his pleasure.</p>


<p id="Patricii">PATRĬCĬI. This word is evidently a derivative
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater</i>, which frequently occurs
in the Roman writers as equivalent to senator.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patricii</i> therefore signifies those who
belonged to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres</i>, but it is a mistake to
suppose that the patricii were only the offspring
of the patres in the sense of senators.
On the contrary, the patricians were, in the
early history of Rome, the whole body of
Roman citizens, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">populus Romanus</i>, and
there were no real citizens besides them.
The other parts of the Roman population,
namely clients and slaves, did not belong to
the populus Romanus, and were not burghers
or patricians. The senators or patres (in
the narrower sense of the word) were a
select body of the populus or patricians,
which acted as their representatives. The
burghers or patricians consisted originally of
three distinct tribes, which afterwards became
united into the sovereign populus.
These tribes had founded settlements upon
several of the hills which were subsequently
included within the precincts of the city of
Rome. Their names were Ramnes, Tities,
and Luceres, or Ramnenses, Titienses, and
Lucerenses. Each of these tribes consisted
of ten curiae, and each curia of ten gentes,
and of the same number of decuries, which
were established for representative and military
purposes. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Senatus">Senatus</a>.</span>] The first tribe,
or the Ramnes, were a Latin colony on the
Palatine hill, said to have been founded by
Romulus. As long as it stood alone, it contained
only one hundred gentes, and had a
senate of one hundred members. When the
Tities, or Sabine settlers on the Quirinal
and Viminal hills, under king Tatius, became
united with the Ramnes, the number of
gentes, as well as that of senators, was increased
to 200. These two tribes after their
union continued probably for a considerable
time to be the patricians of Rome, until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
third tribe, the Luceres, which chiefly consisted
of Etruscans, who had settled on the
Caelian hill, also became united with the
other two as a third tribe. The amalgamation
of these three tribes did not take place
at once: the union between Latins and Sabines
is ascribed to the reign of Romulus,
though it does not appear to have been quite
perfect, since the Latins on some occasions
claimed a superiority over the Sabines. The
Luceres existed for a long time as a separate
tribe without enjoying the same rights as the
two other tribes, until Tarquinius Priscus,
himself an Etruscan, caused them to be
placed on a footing of equality with the
others. For this reason he is said to have
increased the number of senators to 300.
The Luceres, however, are, notwithstanding
this equalisation, sometimes distinguished
from the other tribes by the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patricii minorum gentium</i>. During the time
of the republic, distinguished strangers and
wealthy plebeians were occasionally made
Roman patricians; for instance, Appius Claudius
and his gens, and Domitius Ahenobarbus.
When the plebeians became a distinct
class of citizens [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plebes">Plebes</a></span>], the patricians, of
course, ceased to be the only class of citizens,
but they still retained the exclusive possession
of all the power in the state. All
civil and religious offices were in their possession,
and they continued as before to be the
populus, the nation now consisting of the
populus and the plebes. In their relation to
the plebeians or the commonalty, the patricians
were a real aristocracy of birth. A
person born of a patrician family was and
remained a patrician, whether he was rich
or poor, whether he was a member of the
senate, or an eques, or held any of the great
offices of the state, or not: there was no
power that could make a patrician a plebeian.
As regards the census, he might
indeed not belong to the wealthy classes, but
his rank remained the same. The only way
in which a patrician might become a plebeian
was when of his own accord he left his gens
and curia, gave up the sacra, &amp;c. A plebeian,
on the other hand, or even a stranger,
might be made a patrician by a lex curiata.
But this appears to have been done very
seldom; and the consequence was, that in
the course of a few centuries the number of
patrician families became so rapidly diminished,
that towards the close of the republic
there were not more than fifty such families.
Although the patricians throughout this
whole period had the character of an aristocracy
of birth, yet their political rights
were not the same at all times. During the
first centuries of the republic there was an
almost uninterrupted struggle between patricians
and plebeians, in which the former
exerted every means to retain their exclusive
rights, but which ended in the establishment
of the political equality of the two orders.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plebes">Plebes</a>.</span>] Only a few insignificant priestly
offices, and the performance of certain ancient
religious rites and ceremonies, remained
the exclusive privilege of the patricians; of
which they were the prouder, as in former
days their religious power and significance
were the basis of their political superiority.
At the time when the struggle between patricians
and plebeians ceased, a new kind of
aristocracy began to arise at Rome, which
was partly based upon wealth, and partly
upon the great offices of the republic, and
the term nobiles was given to all persons
whose ancestors had held any of the
curule offices. (Compare <span class="smcap"><a href="#Nobiles">Nobiles</a></span>.) This
aristocracy of nobiles threw the old patricians
as a body still more into the shade,
though both classes of aristocrats united as
far as was possible to monopolise all the
great offices of the state. In their dress and
appearance the patricians were scarcely distinguished
from the rest of the citizens, unless
they were senators, curule magistrates,
or equites, in which case they wore like
others the ensigns peculiar to these classes.
The only thing by which they seem to have
been distinguished in their appearance from
other citizens was a peculiar kind of shoe,
which covered the whole foot and part of the
leg, though it was not as high as the shoes
of senators and curule magistrates. These
shoes were fastened with four strings (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corrigiae</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lora patricia</i>) and adorned with a
lunula on the top.</p>


<p id="Patrimi">PĂTRĪMI ET MĀTRĪMI were children
born of parents, who had been married by
the religious ceremony called confarreatio:
they are almost always mentioned in connection
with religious rites and ceremonies.</p>


<p id="Patronomi">PĂTRŎNŎMI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πατρονόμοι</span>), magistrates at
Sparta, who exercised, as it were, a paternal
power over the whole state. They did not
exist till a late period, and they succeeded to
the powers which the ephori formerly possessed.</p>


<p id="Patronus">PĂTRŌNUS. The act of manumission
created a new relation between the manumissor
and the slave, which was analogous to
that between father and son. The manumissor
became with respect to the manumitted
person his patronus, and the manumitted
person became the libertus of the manumissor.
The word patronus (from pater)
indicates the nature of the relation. If the
manumissor was a woman, she became patrona.
The libertus adopted the gentile name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
of the manumissor. Cicero’s freedman Tiro
was called M. Tullius Tiro. The libertus
owed respect and gratitude to his patron, and
in ancient times the patron might punish
him in a summary way for neglecting those
duties. This obligation extended to the
children of the libertus, and the duty was
due to the children of the patron. It was
the duty of the patron to support his freedman
in case of necessity, and if he did not,
he lost his patronal rights; the consequence
was the same if he brought a capital charge
against him. The most important of the
patronal rights related to the property of
liberti, as in certain cases the patronus had
a right to the whole or a part of the property
of a libertus.</p>


<p id="Pauperies">PAUPĔRĬES, the legal term for mischief
done by an animal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadrupes</i>) contrary to
the nature of the animal, as if a man’s ox
gored another man. In such cases the law
of the Twelve Tables gave the injured person
an action against the owner of the animal
for the amount of the damage sustained.
The owner was bound either to pay the full
amount of damages or to give up the animal
to the injured person (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noxae dare</i>).</p>

<p id="Pecten">PECTEN (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κτείς</span>), a comb. The Greeks and
Romans used combs made of box-wood. The
Egyptians had ivory combs, which also came
into use by degrees among the Romans. The
wooden combs, found in Egyptian tombs, are
toothed on one side only; but the Greeks
used them with teeth on both sides. The
principal use of the comb was for dressing
the hair, in doing which the Greeks of both
sexes were remarkably careful and diligent.
To go with uncombed hair was a sign of
affliction.</p>


<p id="Peculatus">PĔCŬLĀTUS, is properly the misappropriation
or theft of public property. The
person guilty of this offence was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peculator</i>.
The origin of the word appears to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecus</i>,
a term which originally denoted that kind of
moveable property which was the chief sign of
wealth. Originally trials for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peculatus</i> were
before the populus or the senate. In the
time of Cicero matters of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peculatus</i> had become
one of the quaestiones perpetuae.</p>

female slaves, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pedisequae</i>.</p>


<p id="Pedum">PĔDUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κορώνη</span>), a shepherd’s crook. On
account of its connection with pastoral life,
the crook is often seen in works of ancient
art, in the hands of Pan, Satyrs, Fauns, and
shepherds. It was also the usual attribute
of Thalia, as the muse of pastoral poetry.</p>

<p id="Pegma">PEGMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πῆγμα</span>), a pageant, <em>i.e.</em> an edifice
of wood, consisting of two or more stages
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulata</i>), which were raised or depressed at
pleasure by means of balance weights. These
great machines were used in the Roman
amphitheatres, the gladiators who fought
upon them being called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pegmares</i>. They were
supported upon wheels so as to be drawn
into the circus, glittering with silver and a
profusion of wealth. When Vespasian and
Titus celebrated their triumph over the Jews,
the procession included pageants of extraordinary
magnitude and splendour, consisting
of three or four stages above one another,
hung with rich tapestry, and inlaid with
ivory and gold. By the aid of various contrivances
they represented battles and their
numerous incidents, and the attack and defence
of the cities of Judaea. The pegma
was also used in sacrifices. A bull having
been slain in one of the stages, the high
priest placed himself below in a cavern, so
as to receive the blood upon his person and
his garments, and in this state he was produced
by the flamines before the worshippers.</p>


<p id="Pelatae">PĔLĂTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πελάται</span>), were free labourers
working for hire, like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thetes</i>, in contra-distinction
to the helots and penestae, who
were bondsmen or serfs. In the later Greek
writers, such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
and Plutarch, the word is used for the Latin
cliens, though the relations expressed by the

<p id="Pelta">PELTA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέλτη</span>), a small shield. Iphicrates,
observing that the ancient <span class="smcap"><a href="#Clipeus">Clipeus</a></span> was cumbrous
and inconvenient, introduced among
the Greeks a much smaller and lighter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
shield, from which those who bore it took
the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peltastae</i>. It consisted principally
of a frame of wood or wicker-work,
covered with skin or leather.</p>


<p id="Penestae">PĔNESTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πενέσται</span>), a class of serfs in
Thessaly, who stood in nearly the same relation
to their Thessalian lords as the helots of
Laconia did to the Dorian Spartans, although
their condition seems to have been on the
whole superior. They were the descendants
of the old Pelasgic or Aeolian inhabitants of
Thessaly Proper. They occupied an intermediate
position between freemen and purchased
slaves, and they cultivated the land
for their masters, paying by way of rent a
portion of the produce of it. The Penestae
sometimes accompanied their masters to battle,
and fought on horseback as their vassals:
a circumstance which need not excite surprise,
as Thessaly was so famous for cavalry. There
were Penestae among the Macedonians also.</p>

<p id="Pentathlon">PENTATHLON (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πένταθλον</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quinquertium</i>),
was next to the pancratium the most beautiful
of all athletic performances. The persons
engaged in it were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentathli</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πένταθλοι</span>).
The pentathlon consisted of five
distinct kinds of games, viz. leaping (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅλμα</span>),
the foot-race (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δρόμος</span>), the throwing of the
discus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίσκος</span>), the throwing of the spear
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σίγυννος</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκόντιον</span>), and wrestling (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάλη</span>),
which were all performed in one day and in a
certain order, one after the other, by the
same athletae. The pentathlon was introduced
in the Olympic games in Ol. 18.</p>


<p id="Pentecoste">PENTĒCOSTĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκοστή</span>), a duty of two
per cent, levied upon all exports and imports
at Athens. The money was collected by persons
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκοστολόγοι</span>. The merchant
who paid the duty was said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκοντεύεσθαι</span>.
All the customs appear to have been let to
farm, and probably from year to year. They
were let to the highest bidders by the ten
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poletae</i>, acting under the authority of the
senate. The farmers were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελῶναι</span>,
and were said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὠνεῖσθαι τὴν πεντηκοστήν</span>.</p>


<p id="Peplum">PEPLUM or PEPLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέπλος</span>), an outer
garment or shawl, strictly worn by females,
and thus corresponding to the himation or
pallium, the outer garment worn by men.
Like all other pieces of cloth used for the
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amictus">Amictus</a></span>, it was often fastened by means of a
brooch. It was, however, frequently worn
without a brooch. The shawl was also often
worn so as to cover the head while it enveloped
the body, and more especially on occasion
of a funeral or of a marriage, when a
very splendid shawl (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παστός</span>) was worn by
the bride. The following woodcut may be
supposed to represent the moment when the
bride, so veiled, is delivered to her husband
at the door of the nuptial chamber. He
wears the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pallium">Pallium</a></span> only; she has a long
shift beneath her shawl, and is supported by
the pronuba. Of all the productions of the
loom, pepli were those on which the greatest
skill and labour were bestowed. So various
and tasteful were the subjects which they represented,
that poets delighted to describe
them. The art of weaving them was entirely
oriental; and those of the most splendid
dyes and curious workmanship were imported
from Tyre and Sidon. They often constituted
a very important part of the treasures of a
temple, having been presented to the divinity
by suppliants and devotees.</p>

<p id="Perduellio">PERDŬELLĬO was in the ancient times of
the republic nearly the same as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Majestas</i>
of the later times. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Majestas">Majestas</a>.</span>] <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perduellis</i>
originally signified <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hostis</i>, and thus the
offence was equivalent to making war on the
Roman state. Offenders were tried by two
judges called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perduellionis Duumviri</i>. In the
time of the kings the duumviri perduellionis
and the quaestores parricidii appear to have
been the same persons; but after the establishment
of the republic, the offices were
distinct, for the quaestores were appointed
regularly every year, whereas the duumviri
were appointed very rarely, as had been the
case during the kingly period. Livy represents
the duumviri perduellionis as being
appointed by the kings, but they were really
proposed by the king and appointed by the
populus. During the early part of the republic
they were appointed by the comitia curiata,
and afterwards by the comitia centuriata,
on the proposal of the consuls. In the
case of Rabirius (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63), however, this
custom was violated, as the duumviri were
appointed by the praetor instead of by the
comitia centuriata. The punishment for
those who were found guilty of perduellio
was death; they were either hanged on the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbor infelix</i>, or thrown from the Tarpeian
rock. But when the duumviri found a person
guilty, he might appeal to the people (in
early times the populus, afterwards the comitia
centuriata), as was done in the first
case which is on record, that of Horatius,
and in the last, which is that of Rabirius,
whom Cicero defended before the people in
the oration still extant.</p>


<p id="Peregrinus">PĔRĔGRĪNUS, a stranger or foreigner.
In ancient times the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peregrinus</i> was
used as synonymous with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hostis</i>; but in the
times of which we have historical records, a
peregrinus was any person who was not a
Roman citizen. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 247, a second praetor
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetor peregrinus</i>) was appointed for
the purpose of administering justice in matters
between Romans and peregrini, and in
matters between such peregrini as had taken
up their abode at Rome. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Praetor">Praetor</a>.</span>] The
number of peregrini who lived in the city of
Rome appears to have had an injurious influence
upon the poorer classes of Roman citizens,
whence on some occasions they were
driven out of the city. The first example of
this kind was set in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 127, by the tribune
M. Junius Pennus. They were expelled a
second time by the tribune C. Papius, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
66. During the last period of the republic
and the first centuries of the empire, all the
free inhabitants of the Roman world were, in
regard to their political rights, either Roman
citizens, or Latins, or peregrini, and the
latter had, as before, neither commercium
nor connubium with the Romans. They
were either free provincials, or citizens who
had forfeited their civitas, and were degraded
to the rank of peregrini, or a certain class of
freedmen, called peregrini dediticii.</p>


<p id="Perioeci">PĔRĬOECI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίοικοι</span>). This word properly
denotes the inhabitants of a district
lying around some particular locality, but is
generally used to describe a dependent population,
living without the walls or in the
country provinces of a dominant city, and
although personally free, deprived of the enjoyment
of citizenship, and the political
rights conferred by it. A political condition
such as that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perioeci</i> of Greece, and
like the vassalage of the Germanic nations,
could hardly have originated in anything
else than foreign conquest, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perioeci</i>
of Laconia furnish a striking illustration of
this. Their origin dates from the Dorian
conquest of the Peloponnesus, when the old
inhabitants of the country, the Achaeans,
submitted to their conquerors on certain
conditions, by which they were left in possession
of their private rights of citizenship.
They suffered indeed a partial deprivation of
their lands, and were obliged to submit to a
king of foreign race, but still they remained
equal in law to their conquerors, and were
eligible to all offices of state except the sovereignty.
But this state of things did not last
long: in the next generation after the conquest
the relation between the two parties
was changed. The Achaeans were reduced
from citizens to vassals; they were made
tributary to Sparta; their lands were subjected
to a tax; and they lost their rights of
citizenship, the right of voting in the general
assembly, and their eligibility to important
offices in the state, such as that of a senator,
&amp;c. It does not, however, appear that the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perioeci</i> were generally an oppressed people,
though kept in a state of political inferiority
to their conquerors. On the contrary, the
most distinguished among them were admitted
to offices of trust, and they sometimes
served as heavy-armed soldiers; as, for instance,
at the battle of Plataea. The Norman
conquest of England presents a striking parallel
to the Dorian conquest of Laconia,
both in its achievement and consequences.
The Saxons, like the old Achaeans, were deprived
of their lands, excluded from all offices
of trust and dignity, and reduced, though
personally free, to a state of political slavery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
The Normans, on the contrary, of whatever
rank in their own country, were all nobles
and warriors, compared with the conquered
Saxons, and for a long time enjoyed exclusively
the civil and ecclesiastical administration
of the land.</p>


<p id="Periscelis">PĔRISCĔLIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περισκελίς</span>), an anklet or
bangle, worn by the Orientals, the Greeks,
and the Roman ladies also. It decorated the
leg in the same manner as the bracelet adorns
the wrist and the necklace the throat. The
word, however, is sometimes used in the
same sense as the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feminalia</i>, that is,
drawers reaching from the navel to the knees.</p>

a mask. Masks were worn by Greek and
Roman actors in nearly all dramatic representations.
This custom arose undoubtedly
from the practice of smearing the face with
certain juices and colours, and of appearing
in disguise, at the festivals of Dionysus.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Dionysia">Dionysia</a>.</span>] Now, as the Greek drama arose
out of these festivals, it is highly probable
that some mode of disguising the face was as
old as the drama itself. Choerilus of Samos,
however, (about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 500) is said to have
been the first who introduced regular masks.
Other writers attribute the invention of
masks to Thespis or Aeschylus, though the
latter had probably only the merit of perfecting
and completing the whole theatrical apparatus
and costume. Some masks covered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
like the masks of modern times, only the
face, but they appear more generally to have
covered the whole head down to the shoulders,
for we always find the hair belonging to a
mask described as being a part of it; and
this must have been the case in tragedy more
especially, as it was necessary to make the
head correspond to the stature of an actor,
which was heightened by the cothurnus.</p>

<p id="Pes">PES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποῦς</span>), a foot, the standard measure

the uncial division [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As_c">As</a></span>] to the foot, which
thus contained 12 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unciae</i>, whence our <em>inches</em>;
and many of the words used to express certain
numbers of unciae are applied to the
parts of the foot. It was also divided into 16
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">digiti</i> (finger-breadths): this mode of division
was used especially by architects and land-surveyors,
and is found on all the foot-measures
that have come down to us. From
the analogy of the as, we have also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dupondium</i>
for 2 feet, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pes sestertius</i> for 2½ feet. The
probable value of the Roman foot is 11.6496
inches English. (See <a href="#TABLES">Tables</a> at the end.)</p>

board moving up and down, with a person at
each end, and supported in the middle, something
like our see-saw; only it appears to
have been much longer, and consequently

They were usually worn in pairs; and we
most commonly read of them as ornaments
attached to the harness of horses, especially
about the head, and often worn as pendants
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pensilia</i>), so as to produce a terrific effect

<p id="Pharos">PHĂROS or PHĂRUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάρος</span>), a light-house.
The most celebrated light-house of
antiquity was that situated at the entrance
to the port of Alexandria, on an island which
bore the name of Pharos. It contained many
stories, and the upper stories had windows
looking seawards, and torches or fires were
kept burning in them by night in order to
guide vessels into the harbour. The name

allusion to that at Alexandria, which was the

<p id="Phaselus">PHĂSĒLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάσηλος</span>), a vessel rather long
and narrow, apparently so called from its
resemblance to the shape of a phaselus or
kidney-bean. It was chiefly used by the
Egyptians, and was of various sizes, from a
mere boat to a vessel adapted for long voyages.
The phaselus was built for speed, to
which more attention seems to have been
paid than to its strength: whence the epithet
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fragilis</i> is given to it by Horace. These vessels
were sometimes made of clay, to which

Athens might be prosecuted; but the word
is often used to denote any kind of information;
and we do not know in what respects
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phasis</i> was distinguished from other
methods of prosecution. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sycophantes</i>

<p id="Phylarchi">PHỸLARCHI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φύλαρχοι</span>) were at Athens
after the age of Cleisthenes ten officers, one
for each of the tribes, and were specially
charged with the command and superintendence
of the cavalry. There can be but little
doubt that each of the phylarchs commanded
the cavalry of his own tribe, and they were
themselves collectively and individually under
the control of the two hipparchs, just as the
taxiarchs were subject to the two strategi.
Herodotus informs us that when Cleisthenes
increased the number of the tribes from four
to ten, he also made ten phylarchs instead of
four. It has been thought, however, that
the historian should have said ten phylarchs
in the place of the old phylobasileis, who
were four in number, one for each of the old
tribes.</p>


<p id="Phylobasileis">PHỸLŎBĂSĬLEIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλοβασιλεῖς</span>) were
four in number, representing each one of the
four ancient Athenian tribes, and probably
elected (but not for life) from and by them.
They were nominated from the Eupatridae,
and during the continuance of royalty at
Athens these “kings of the tribes” were the
constant assessors of the sovereign, and rather
as his colleagues than counsellors. Though
they were originally connected with the four
ancient tribes, still they were not abolished
by Cleisthenes when he increased the number
of tribes, probably because their duties were
mainly of a religious character. They appear
to have existed even after his time, and acted
as judges, but in unimportant or merely
formal matters.</p>


<p id="Pictura">PICTŪRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφή</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφική</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωγραφία</span>),
painting. I. <em>History of the Art.</em> It is singular
that the poems of Homer do not contain
any mention of painting as an imitative
art. This is the more remarkable, since
Homer speaks of rich and elaborate embroidery
as a thing not uncommon. This
embroidery is actual painting in principle,
and is a species of painting in practice, and
it was considered such by the Romans, who
termed it “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pictura textilis</span>.” The various
allusions also to other arts, similar in nature
to painting, are sufficient to prove that painting
must have existed in some degree in
Homer’s time, although the only kind of
painting he notices is the “red-cheeked”
and “purple-cheeked ships,” and an ivory
ornament for the faces of horses, which a
Maeonian or Carian woman colours with
purple. Painting seems to have made considerable
progress in Asia Minor while it
was still in its infancy in Greece, for Candaules,
king of Lydia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 716), is said to
have purchased at a high price a painting of
Bularchus, which represented a battle of the
Magnetes. The old Ionic painting probably
flourished at the same time with the Ionian
architecture, and continued as an independent
school until the sixth century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when the
Ionians lost their liberty, and with their
liberty their art. Herodotus (i. 164) mentions
that when Harpagus besieged the town
of Phocaea (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 544), the inhabitants collected
all their valuables, their statues and
votive offerings from the temples, leaving
only their <em>paintings</em>, and such works in metal
or of stone as could not easily be removed,
and fled with them to the island of Chios;
from which we may conclude that paintings
were not only valued by the Phocaeans, but
also common among them. Herodotus (iv.
88) also informs us that Mandrocles of Samos,
who constructed for Darius Hystaspis the
bridge of boats across the Bosporus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
508), had a picture painted, representing the
passage of Darius’s army, and the king
seated on a throne reviewing the troops as
they passed, which he dedicated in the temple
of Hera at Samos. After the conquest of
Ionia, Samos became the seat of the arts.
The Heraeum at Samos, in which the picture
of Mandrocles was placed, was a general depository
for works of art, and in the time of
Strabo appears to have been particularly rich
in paintings, for he terms it a “picture-gallery”
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πινακοθήκη</span>). The first painter in
Greece itself, whose name is recorded, is
Cimon of Cleonae. His exact period is uncertain,
but he was probably a contemporary
of Solon, and lived at least a century before
Polygnotus. It was with Polygnotus of Thasos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
that painting reached its full development
(about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 463). Previous to this time the
only cities that had paid any considerable
attention to painting were Aegina, Sicyon,
Corinth, and Athens. Sicyon and Corinth
had long been famous for their paintings
upon vases and upon articles of furniture;
the school of Athens had attained no celebrity
whatever until the arrival of Polygnotus from
Thasos raised it to that pre-eminence which
it continued to maintain for more than two
centuries, although very few of the great
painters of Greece were natives of Athens.
The principal contemporaries of Polygnotus
were Dionysius of Colophon, Plistaenetus
and Panaenus of Athens, brothers (or the
latter perhaps a nephew) of Phidias, and
Micon, also of Athens. The works of Polygnotus
and his contemporaries were conspicuous
for expression, character, and design;
the more minute discriminations of tone and
local colour, united with dramatic composition
and effect, were accomplished in the succeeding
generation, about 420 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, through the
efforts of Apollodorus of Athens and Zeuxis
of Heraclea. The contemporaries of Apollodorus
and Zeuxis, and those who carried out
their principles, were Parrhasius of Ephesus,
Eupompus of Sicyon, and Timanthes of Cythnus,
all painters of the greatest fame. Athens
and Sicyon were the principal seats of the art
at this period. Eupompus of Sicyon was the
founder of the celebrated Sicyonian school of
painting which was afterwards established
by Pamphilus. The Alexandrian period was
the last of progression or acquisition; but it
only added variety of effect to the tones it
could not improve, and was principally characterised
by the diversity of the styles of so
many contemporary artists. The most eminent
painters of this period were Protogenes,
Pamphilus, Melanthius, Antiphilus, Theon of
Samos, Apelles, Euphranor, Pausias, Nicias,
Nicomachus, and his brother Aristides. Of
all these Apelles was the greatest. The quality
in which he surpassed all other painters
will scarcely bear a definition; it has been
termed grace, elegance, beauty, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χάρις</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">venustas</i>.
His greatest work was perhaps his
Venus Anadyomene, Venus rising out of the
waters. He excelled in portrait, and indeed
all his works appear to have been portraits
in an extended sense; for his pictures, both
historical and allegorical, consisted nearly all
of single figures. He enjoyed the exclusive
privilege of painting the portraits of Alexander.&mdash;The
works of Greek art brought
from Sicily by Marcellus were the first to
inspire the Romans with the desire of adorning
their public edifices with statues and
paintings, which taste was converted into a
passion when they became acquainted with
the great treasures and almost inexhaustible
resources of Greece, and their rapacity knew
no bounds. Mummius, after the destruction
of Corinth, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 146, carried off or destroyed
more works of art than all his predecessors
put together. Scaurus, in his aedileship,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 58, had all the public pictures still remaining
in Sicyon transported to Rome, on
account of the debts of the former city, and
he adorned the great temporary theatre which
he erected upon that occasion with 3000
bronze statues. Verres ransacked Asia and
Achaia, and plundered almost every temple
and public edifice in Sicily of whatever was
valuable in it. Amongst the numerous robberies
of Verres, Cicero mentions particularly
twenty-seven beautiful pictures taken from
the temple of Minerva at Syracuse, consisting
of portraits of the kings and tyrants of Sicily.
Yet Rome was, about the end of the republic,
full of painters, who appear, however, to have
been chiefly occupied in portrait, or decorative
and arabesque painting. Among the
Romans the earliest painter mentioned is a
member of the noble house of the Fabii, who
received the surname of Pictor through some
paintings which he executed in the temple of
Salus at Rome, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 304, which lasted till the
time of the emperor Claudius, when they
were destroyed by the fire that consumed
that temple. Pacuvius also, the tragic poet,
and nephew of Ennius, distinguished himself
by some paintings in the temple of Hercules
in the Forum Boarium, about 180 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> But
generally speaking the artists at Rome were
Greeks. Julius Caesar, Agrippa, and Augustus
were among the earliest great patrons
of artists. Caesar expended great sums in
the purchase of pictures by the old masters.
He gave as much as 80 talents for two pictures
by his contemporary Timomachus of
Byzantium, one an Ajax, and the other a
Medea meditating the murder of her children.
These pictures, which were painted in encaustic,
were very celebrated works; they are
alluded to by Ovid (<cite>Trist.</cite> ii. 525), and are
mentioned by many other ancient writers.&mdash;There
are three distinct periods observable in
the history of painting in Rome. The first
or great period of Graeco-Roman art may be
dated from the conquest of Greece until the
time of Augustus, when the artists were
chiefly Greeks. The second, from the time
of Augustus to the so-called Thirty Tyrants
and Diocletian, or from the beginning of the
Christian era until about the latter end of the
third century, during which time the great
majority of Roman works of art were produced.
The third comprehends the state of
the arts during the exarchate, when Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
in consequence of the foundation of Constantinople,
and the changes it involved, suffered
similar spoliations to those which it had previously
inflicted upon Greece. This was the
period of the total decay of the imitative arts
amongst the ancients. About the beginning
of the second period is the earliest age in
which we have any notice of portrait painters
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imaginum pictores</i>) as a distinct class. Portraits
must have been exceedingly numerous
amongst the Romans; Varro made a collection
of the portraits of 700 eminent men. The
portraits or statues of men who had performed
any public service were placed in the
temples and other public places; and several
edicts were passed by the emperors of Rome
respecting the placing of them. The portraits
of authors also were placed in the public
libraries; they were apparently fixed above
the cases which contained their writings,
below which chairs were placed for the convenience
of readers. They were painted also
at the beginning of manuscripts. Several of
the most celebrated ancient artists were both
sculptors and painters; Phidias and Euphranor
were both; Zeuxis and Protogenes
were both modellers; Polygnotus devoted
some attention to statuary; and Lysippus
consulted Eupompus upon style in sculpture.
Moreover scene-painting shows that the
Greeks were acquainted with perspective at
a very early period; for when Aeschylus was
exhibiting tragedies at Athens, Agatharchus
made a scene, and left a treatise upon it.&mdash;II.
<em>Methods of Painting.</em> There were two distinct
classes of painting practised by the ancients&mdash;in
water colours, and in wax, both of
which were practised in various ways. Of
the former the principal were fresco, al fresco;
and the various kinds of distemper (a tempera),
with glue, with the white of egg, or
with gums (a guazzo); and with wax or
resins when these were rendered by any
means vehicles that could be worked with
water. Of the latter the principal was
through fire (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διὰ πυρὸς</span>), termed encaustic
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐγκαυστική</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">encaustica</i>). The painting in
wax (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κηρογραφία</span>), or ship painting (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inceramenta
navium</i>), was distinct from encaustic.
It does not appear that the Greeks or Romans
ever painted in oil; the only mention of oil
in ancient writers in connection with painting
is the small quantity which entered into
the composition of encaustic varnish to temper
it. They painted upon wood, clay, plaster,
stone, parchment, and canvas. The use of
canvas must have been of late introduction,
as there is no mention of it having been employed
by the Greek painters of the best
periods. They generally painted upon panels
or tablets (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πίνακες</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πινόκια</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabellae</i>),
which when finished were fixed into frames
of various descriptions and materials, and
encased in walls. The style or cestrum used
in drawing, and for spreading the wax colours,
pointed at one end and broad and flat
at the other, was termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφίς</span> by the Greeks
and cestrum by the Romans; it was generally
made of metal. The hair pencil (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penicillus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">penicillum</i>) was termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπογραφίς</span>, and apparently
also <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥαβδίον</span>. The ancients used also a
palette very similar to that used by the moderns.
Encaustic was a method very frequently
practised by the Roman and later
Greek painters; but it was in very little use
by the earlier painters, and was not generally
adopted until after the time of Alexander.
Pliny defines the term thus: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ceris pingere
ac picturam inurere</span>,” to paint with wax or
wax colours, and to <em>burn in</em> the picture afterwards
with the cauterium; it appears therefore
to have been the simple addition of the
process of <em>burning in</em> to the ordinary method
of painting with wax colours. Cerae (waxes)
was the ordinary term for painters’ colours
amongst the Romans, but more especially
encaustic colours, and they kept them in
partitioned boxes, as painters do at present.&mdash;III.
<em>Polychromy.</em> Ancient statues were often
painted, and what is now termed polychrome
sculpture was very common in Greece. The
practice of colouring statues is undoubtedly
as ancient as the art of statuary itself;
although they were perhaps originally coloured
more from a love of colour than from
any design of improving the resemblance of
the representation. The Jupiter of the Capitol,
placed by Tarquinius Priscus, was coloured
with minium. In later times the custom
seems to have been reduced to a system, and
was practised with more reserve. The practice
also of colouring architecture seems to
have been universal amongst the Greeks, and
very general amongst the Romans.&mdash;IV. <em>Vase
Painting.</em> The fictile-vase painting of the
Greeks was an art of itself, and was practised
by a distinct class of artists. The designs
upon these vases (which the Greeks
termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λήκυθοι</span>) have been variously interpreted,
but they have been generally considered
to be in some way connected with the
initiation into the Eleusinian and other mysteries.
They were given as prizes to the
victors at the Panathenaea and other games,
and seem to have been always buried with
their owners at their death, for they have
been discovered only in tombs. Even in the
time of the Roman empire painted vases
were termed “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">operis antiqui</span>,” and were then
sought for in the ancient tombs of Campania
and other parts of Magna Graecia. We may
form some idea of their immense value from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the statement of Pliny, that they were more
valuable than the Murrhine vases. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Murrhina">Murrhina
Vasa</a>.</span>] The paintings on the vases,
considered as works of art, vary exceedingly
in the detail of the execution, although in
style of design they may be arranged in two
principal classes, the black and the yellow;
for those which do not come strictly under
either of these heads are either too few or
vary too slightly to require a distinct classification.
The black are the most ancient, the
yellow the most common.&mdash;V. <em>Mosaic</em>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pictura de musivo</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opus musivum</i>, was very
general in Rome in the time of the early
emperors. It was also common in Greece
and Asia Minor at an earlier period, but at
the time of the Roman empire it began to a
great extent even to supersede painting. It
was used chiefly for floors, but walls and also
ceilings were sometimes ornamented in the
same way. There are still many great mosaics
of the ancients extant. The most valuable is
the one discovered in Pompeii a few years
ago, which is supposed to represent the battle
of Issus. The composition is simple, forcible,
and beautiful, and the design exhibits in
many respects merits of the highest order.</p>


<p id="Pila">PĪLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαῖρα</span>), a ball. The game at ball
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαιριστική</span>) was one of the most favourite
gymnastic exercises of the Greeks and Romans,
from the earliest times to the fall of
the Roman empire. It is mentioned in the
Odyssey, where it is played by the Phaeacian
damsels to the sound of music, and also by
two celebrated performers at the court of
Alcinous in a most artistic manner accompanied
with dancing. The various movements
of the body required in the game of
ball gave elasticity and grace to the figure;
whence it was highly esteemed by the Greeks.
The Athenians set so high a value on it, that
they conferred upon Aristonicus of Carystus
the right of citizenship on account of his
skill in this game. It was equally esteemed
by the other states of Greece; the young
Spartans, when they were leaving the condition
of ephebi, were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαιρεῖς</span>, probably
because their chief exercise was the
game at ball. Every complete gymnasium
had a room (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαιριστήριον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαίριστρα</span>) devoted
to this exercise [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Gymnasium">Gymnasium</a></span>], where a
special teacher (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σφαιριστικός</span>) gave instruction
in the art. Among the Romans the
game at ball was generally played at by
persons before taking the bath, in a room
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sphaeristerium</i>) attached to the baths for
the purpose. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pila</i> was used in a general
sense for any kind of ball: but the balls
among the Romans seem to have been of
three kinds; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pila</i> in its narrower sense,
a small ball; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">follis</i>, a great ball filled
with air; and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paganica</i>, of which we
know scarcely anything, but which appears
to have been smaller than the follis and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
larger than the pila. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Harpastum</i> (from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁρπάζω</span>) seems to have been the name of a
ball, which was thrown among the players,
each of whom endeavoured to catch it.</p>

<p id="Pilentum">PĪLENTUM, a splendid four-wheeled carriage,

any piece of felt; more especially a
skull-cap of felt, a hat. There seems no
reason to doubt that felting is a more ancient
invention than weaving [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tela">Tela</a></span>], nor that
both of these arts came into Europe from
Asia. From the Greeks, who were acquainted
with this article as early as the age
of Homer, the use of felt passed together
with its name to the Romans. Its principal
use was to make coverings of the head for
the male sex, and the most common one was
a simple skull-cap.&mdash;Among the Romans the
cap of felt was the emblem of liberty. When
a slave obtained his freedom he had his head
shaven, and wore instead of his hair an undyed
pileus. This change of attire took
place in the temple of Feronia, who was
the goddess of freedmen. Hence the phrase
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">servos ad pileum vocare</i> is a summons to
liberty, by which slaves were frequently
called upon to take up arms with a promise
of liberty. The figure of Liberty on some
of the coins of Antoninus Pius, struck <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
145, holds this cap in the right hand. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Petasus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέτασος</span>) differed from the pileus or
simple skull-cap in having a wide brim: the
etymology of the word, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πετάννυμι</span>, expresses
the distinctive shape of these hats.
It was preferred to the skull-cap as a protection
from the sun.</p>

bread was originally made at home by the
women of the house; and there were no
persons at Rome who made baking a trade,
or any slaves specially kept for this purpose
in private houses, till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 173. The name

Bread was not generally made at

<p id="Plagium">PLĂGĬUM, the offence of kidnapping,

pecuniary; but this fell into disuse, and
persons who offended against the lex were
punished according to the nature of their

condemned to the mines. The word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plagium</i> is said to come from the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλάγιος</span>,
oblique, indirect, dolosus. He who committed

<p id="Plaustrum">PLAUSTRUM or PLOSTRUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅμαξα</span>), a
cart or waggon. It had commonly two
wheels, but sometimes four, and it was then
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plaustrum majus</i>. Besides the
wheels and axle the plaustrum consisted of a
strong pole (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">temo</i>), to the hinder part of
which was fastened a table of wooden planks.
The blocks of stone, or other things to be carried,
were either laid upon this table without
any other support, or an additional security<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
was obtained by the use either of boards at
the sides, or of a large wicker basket tied
upon the cart. The annexed cut exhibits a
cart, the body of which is supplied by a
basket. The commonest kind of cart-wheel
was that called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tympanum</i>, “the drum,” from
its resemblance to the musical instrument of
the same name. It was nearly a foot in
thickness, and was made either by sawing
the trunk of a tree across in a horizontal
direction, or by nailing together boards of
the requisite shape and size. (See the cut.)
These wheels advanced slowly, and made a loud
creaking, which was heard to a great distance.</p>

<p id="Plebes">PLĒBES or PLEBS. PLĒBĒII. This
word contains the same root as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">im-pleo</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">com-pleo</i>,
&amp;c., and is therefore etymologically
connected with <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλῆθος</span>, a term which was
applied to the plebeians by the more correct
Greek writers on Roman history, while
others wrongly called them <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῆμος</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ δημοτικοί</span>.
The plebeians were the body of commons
or the commonalty of Rome, and thus
constituted one of the two great elements of
which the Roman nation consisted, and
which has given to the earlier periods of
Roman history its peculiar character and
interest. The time when the plebeians first
appear as a distinct class of Roman citizens
in contradistinction to the patricians, is in
the reign of Tullus Hostilius. Alba, the
head of the Latin confederacy, was in his
reign taken by the Romans and razed to the
ground. The most distinguished of its inhabitants
were transplanted to Rome and
received among the patricians; but the great
bulk of Alban citizens, who were likewise
transferred to Rome, received settlements on
the Caelian hill, and were kept in a state of
submission to the populus Romanus or the
patricians. This new population of Rome,
which in number is said to have been equal
to the old inhabitants of the city or the
patricians, were the plebeians. They were
Latins, and consequently of the same blood
as the Ramnes, the noblest of the three
patrician tribes. After the conquest of Alba,
Rome, in the reign of Ancus Martius, acquired
possession of a considerable extent of
country, containing a number of dependent
Latin towns, as Medullia, Fidenae, Politorium,
Tellenae, and Ficana. Great numbers of the
inhabitants of these towns were again transplanted
to Rome, and incorporated with the
plebeians already settled there, and the Aventine
was assigned to them as their habitation.
Some portions of the land which these new
citizens had possessed were given back to
them by the Romans, so that they remained
free land-owners as much as the conquerors
themselves, and thus were distinct from the
clients.&mdash;The plebeians were citizens, but not
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">optimo jure</i>; they were perfectly distinct
from the patricians, and were neither contained
in the three tribes, nor in the curiae,
nor in the patrician gentes. The only point
of contact between the two estates was the
army. The plebeians were obliged to fight
and shed their blood in the defence of their
new fellow-citizens, without being allowed
to share any of their rights or privileges, and
without even the right of intermarriage (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">connubium</i>).
In all judicial matters they were
entirely at the mercy of the patricians, and
had no right of appeal against any unjust
sentence, though they were not, like the
clients, bound to have a patronus. They
continued to have their own sacra, which they
had had before the conquest, but these were
regulated by the patrician pontiffs. Lastly,
they were free land-owners, and had their
own gentes.&mdash;The population of the Roman
state thus consisted of two opposite elements;
a ruling class or an aristocracy, and the
commonalty, which, though of the same
stock as the noblest among the rulers, and
exceeding them in numbers, yet enjoyed none
of the rights which might enable them to
take a part in the management of public
affairs, religious or civil. Their citizenship
resembled the relation of aliens to a state, in
which they are merely tolerated on condition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
of performing certain services, and they are,
in fact, sometimes called peregrini. That
such a state of things could not last, is a
truth which must have been felt by every
one who was not blinded by his own selfishness
and love of dominion. Tarquinius
Priscus was the first who conceived the idea
of placing the plebeians on a footing of equality
with the old burghers, by dividing them
into three tribes, which he intended to call
after his own name and those of his friends.
But this noble plan was frustrated by the
opposition of the augur Attus Navius, who
probably acted the part of a representative of
the patricians. All that Tarquinius could do
was to effect the admission of the noblest
plebeian families into the three old tribes,
who were distinguished from the old patrician
families by the names of Ramnes, Tities, and
Luceres secundi, and their gentes are sometimes
distinguished by the epithet minores,
as they entered into the same relation in
which the Luceres had been to the first two
tribes, before the time of Tarquinius. It was
reserved to his successor, Servius Tullius, to
give to the commonalty a regular internal
organisation, and to determine their relations
to the patricians. He first divided the city
into four, and then the subject country
around, which was inhabited by plebeians,
into twenty-six regions or local tribes, and
in these regions he assigned lots of land to
those plebeians who were yet without landed
property. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribus">Tribus</a>.</span>] Each tribe had its
praefect, called tribunus. The tribes had
also their own sacra, festivals, and meetings
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia tributa</i>), which were convoked by
their tribunes. This division into tribes with
tribunes at their heads was no more than an
internal organisation of the plebeians, analogous
to the division of the patricians into
thirty curiae, without conferring upon them
the right to interfere in any way in the
management of public affairs, or in the elections,
which were left entirely to the senate
and the curiae. These rights, however, they
obtained by another regulation of Servius
Tullius, which was made wholly independent
of the thirty tribes. For this purpose he
instituted a census, and divided the whole
body of Roman citizens, plebeians as well as
patricians, into five classes, according to the
amount of their property. Taxation and the
military duties were arranged according to
these classes in such a manner, that the
heavier burdens fell upon the wealthier
classes. The whole body of citizens thus
divided was formed into a great national
assembly called comitiatus maximus, or comitia
centuriata. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Comitia">Comitia</a>.</span>] In this assembly
the plebeians now met the patricians apparently
on a footing of equality, but the votes
were distributed in such a way that it was
always in the power of the wealthiest classes,
to which the patricians naturally belonged,
to decide a question before it was put to the
vote of the poorer classes. A great number
of such noble plebeian families, as after the
subjugation of the Latin towns had not been
admitted into the curies by Tarquinius Priscus,
were now constituted by Servius into a
number of equites, with twelve suffragia in
the comitia centuriata. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Equites">Equites</a>.</span>] In this
constitution, the plebeians, as such, did not
obtain admission to the senate, nor to the
highest magistracy, nor to any of the priestly
offices. To all these offices the patricians
alone thought themselves entitled by divine
right. The plebeians also continued to be
excluded from occupying any portion of the
public land, which as yet was possessed only
by the patricians, and they were only allowed
to keep their cattle upon the common pasture.&mdash;In
the early times of the republic there was a
constant struggle between the two orders, the
history of which belongs to a history of Rome,
and cannot be given here. Eventually the
plebeians gained access to all the civil and
religious offices, until at last the two hostile
elements became united into one great body
of Roman citizens with equal rights, and a
state of things arose, totally different from
what had existed before. After the first
secession, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 494, the plebeians gained
several great advantages. First, a law was
passed to prevent the patricians from taking
usurious interest of money, which they frequently
lent to impoverished plebeians;
secondly, tribunes were appointed for the
protection of the plebeians [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribunus">Tribuni</a></span>]; and
lastly, plebeian aediles were appointed.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aediles">Aediles</a>.</span>] Shortly after, they gained the
right to summon before their own comitia
tributa any one who had violated the rights
of their order, and to make decrees (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plebiscita</i>),
which, however, did not become binding
upon the whole nation, free from the control
of the curies, until the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 286. <ins class="corr" id="tn-299" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'In (B.C. 445), the'">
In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 445, the</ins> tribune Canuleius established,
by his rogations, the connubium between
patricians and plebeians. He also attempted to
divide the consulship between the two orders,
but the patricians frustrated the realisation of
this plan by the appointment of six military
tribunes, who were to be elected from both
orders. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribunus">Tribuni</a>.</span>] But that the plebeians
might have no share in the censorial power,
with which the consuls had been invested,
the military tribunes did not obtain that
power, and a new curule dignity, the censorship,
was established, with which patricians
alone were to be invested. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Censor">Censor</a>.</span>] In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 421 the plebeians were admitted to the
quaestorship, which opened to them the way
into the senate, where henceforth their number
continued to increase. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Quaestor">Quaestor</a></span>;
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Senatus">Senatus</a></span>.] In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 367 the tribunes L.
Licinius Stolo and L. Sextius placed themselves
at the head of the commonalty, and
resumed the contest against the patricians.
After a fierce struggle, which lasted for several
years, they at length carried a rogation,
according to which decemvirs were to be
appointed for keeping the Sibylline books
instead of duumvirs, of whom half were to
be plebeians. The next great step was the
restoration of the consulship, on condition
that one consul should always be a plebeian.
A third rogation of Licinius, which was only
intended to afford momentary relief to the
poor plebeians, regulated the rate of interest.
From this time forward the plebeians also
appear in the possession of the right to
occupy parts of the ager publicus. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
366, L. Sextius Lateranus was the first plebeian
consul. The patricians, however, who
always contrived to yield no more than what
it was absolutely impossible for them to
retain, stripped the consulship of a considerable
part of its power, and transferred it to
two new curule offices, viz. that of praetor and
of curule aedile. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aediles">Aediles</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Praetor">Praetor</a></span>.] But
after such great advantages had been once
gained by the plebeians, it was impossible to
stop them in their progress towards a perfect
equality of political rights with the patricians.
In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 356, C. Marcius Rutilus was the first
plebeian dictator; in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 351 the censorship
was thrown open to the plebeians, and in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
336 the praetorship. The Ogulnian law, in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 300, also opened to them the offices of
pontifex and augur. These advantages were,
as might be supposed, not gained without the
fiercest opposition of the patricians, and even
after they were gained and sanctioned by
law, the patricians exerted every means to
obstruct the operation of the law. Such
fraudulent attempts led, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 286, to the
last secession of the plebeians, after which,
however, the dictator Q. Hortensius successfully
and permanently reconciled the two
orders, secured to the plebeians all the rights
they had acquired until then, and procured
for their plebiscita the full power of leges
binding upon the whole nation. After the
passing of the Hortensian law, the political
distinction between patricians and plebeians
ceased, and, with a few unimportant exceptions,
both orders were placed on a footing of
perfect equality. Henceforth the name populus
is sometimes applied to the plebeians
alone, and sometimes to the whole body of
Roman citizens, as assembled in the comitia
centuriata or tributa. The term plebs or
plebecula, on the other hand, was applied, in
a loose manner of speaking, to the multitude
or populace, in opposition to the nobiles or
the senatorial party.&mdash;A person who was
born a plebeian could only be raised to the
rank of a patrician by a lex curiata, as was
sometimes done during the kingly period,
and in the early times of the republic. It
frequently occurs in the history of Rome that
one and the same gens contains plebeian as
well as patrician families. In the gens
Cornelia, for instance, we find the plebeian
families of the Balbi, Mammulae, Merulae,
&amp;c., along with the patrician Scipiones, Sullae,
Lentuli, &amp;c. The occurrence of this
phenomenon may be accounted for in different
ways. It may have been, that one branch of
a plebeian family was made patrician while
the others remained plebeians. It may also
have happened that two families had the
same nomen gentilicium without being actual
members of the same gens. Again, a patrician
family might go over to the plebeians,
and as such a family continued to bear the
name of its patrician gens, this gens apparently
contained a plebeian family. When a
peregrinus obtained the civitas through the
influence of a patrician, or when a slave was
emancipated by his patrician master, they
generally adopted the nomen gentilicium of
their benefactor, and thus appear to belong
to the same gens with him.</p>


<p id="Plebiscitum">PLĒBISCĪTUM, a name properly applied
to a law passed at the comitia tributa on the
rogation of a tribune. Originally, a plebiscitum
required confirmation by the comitia
curiata and the senate; but a Lex Hortensia
was passed <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 286, to the effect
that plebiscita should bind all the populus
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">universus populus</i>), and this lex rendered
confirmation unnecessary. The Lex Hortensia
is always referred to as the lex which
put plebiscita as to their binding force exactly
on the same footing as leges. The
principal plebiscita are mentioned under the
article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Lex">Lex</a></span>.</p>

<p id="Plethron">PLETHRON (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλέθρον</span>), the fundamental
land measure in the Greek system, being the
square of 100 feet, that is, 10,000 square
feet. The later Greek writers use it as the
translation of the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jugerum</i>, probably
because the latter was the standard land
measure in the Roman system; but, in size,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plethron</i> answered more nearly to the
Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actus</i>, or half-jugerum, which was
the older unit of land measures. As frequently
happened with the ancient land
measures, the side of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plethron</i> was taken
as a measure of length, with the same name.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plethron</i> was equal to 100 feet (or about
101 English feet) = 66⅔ <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πήχεις</span> = 10 <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκαιναι</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάλαμοι</span>. It was also introduced into the
system of itinerary measures, being 1-6th of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stadium</i>.</p>


<p id="Pluteus">PLŬTĔUS, was applied in military affairs
to two different objects. (1) A kind of shed
made of hurdles, and covered with raw hides,
which could be moved forward by small
wheels attached to it, and under which the
besiegers of a town made their approaches.
(2) Boards or planks placed on the vallum of
a camp, on moveable towers or other military
engines, as a kind of roof or covering for the
protection of the soldiers.</p>


<p id="Plynteria">PLYNTĒRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλυντήρια</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλύνειν</span>, to
wash), a festival celebrated at Athens every
year, on the 25th of Thargelion, in honour of
Athena, surnamed Aglauros, whose temple
stood on the Acropolis. The day of this festival
was at Athens among the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποφράδες</span> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies nefasti</i>; for the temple of the goddess
was surrounded by a rope to preclude all
communication with it; her statue was
stripped of its garments and ornaments for
the purpose of cleaning them, and was in
the meanwhile covered over, to conceal it
from the sight of man. The city was therefore,
so to speak, on this day without its
protecting divinity, and any undertaking
commenced on it was believed to be necessarily
unsuccessful.</p>

<p id="Poena">POENA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποινή</span>), a general name for any
punishment of any offence. Multa is the
penalty of a particular offence. A Poena was
only inflicted when it was imposed by some
lex or some other legal authority (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo alio

multa or penalty might be inflicted.</p>


<p id="Polemarchus">PŎLĔMARCHUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολέμαρχος</span>). Respecting
the polemarchus at Athens, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Archon">Archon</a></span>.
We read also of polemarchs at Sparta, and in
various cities of Boeotia. As their name
denotes, they were originally and properly
connected with military affairs, being entrusted
either with the command of armies
abroad, or the superintendence of the war
department at home; sometimes with both.
The polemarchs of Sparta appear to have
ranked next to the king, when on actual service
abroad, and were generally of the royal
kindred or house (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένος</span>). They commanded
single morae, so that they would appear to
have been six in number, and sometimes
whole armies. They also formed part of the
king’s council in war, and of the royal escort
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">damosia</i>. At Thebes there appear to
have been two polemarchs, perhaps elected,
annually; and in times of peace they seem to
have been invested with the chief executive
power of the state, and the command of the
city, having its military force under their
orders. They are not, however, to be confounded
with the Boeotarchs.</p>


<p id="Poletae">PŌLĒTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πωλῆται</span>), a board of ten officers,
or magistrates, whose duty it was to
grant leases of the public lands and mines,
and also to let the revenues arising from the
customs, taxes, confiscations, and forfeitures.
Of such letting the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πωλεῖν</span> (not <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μισθοῦν</span>)
was generally used, and also the correlative
words <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὠνεῖσθαι</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρίασθαι</span>. One was chosen
from each tribe. In the letting of the revenue
they were assisted by the managers of the
theoric fund (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ θεωρικόν</span>), and they acted
under the authority of the senate of Five
Hundred, who exercised a general control
over the financial department of the administration.
Resident aliens, who did not pay
their residence tax (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετοίκιον</span>), were summoned
before them, and, if found to have
committed default, were sold.</p>


<p id="Pollinctores">POLLINCTŌRES. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Funus">Funus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Pomoerium">PŌMOĒRĬUM. This word is compounded
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">moerium</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">murus</i>), in the same
manner as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pomeridiem</i> of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meridiem</i>,
and thus signifies a line running by the walls
of a town (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pone</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post muros</i>). But the
walls of a town here spoken of are not its
actual walls or fortifications, but symbolical
walls, and the course of the pomoerium itself
was marked by stone pillars, erected at certain
intervals. The sacred line of the Roman
pomoerium did not prevent the inhabitants
from building upon or taking into use any
place beyond it, but it was necessary to leave
a certain space on each side of it unoccupied,
so as not to unhallow it by profane use.
Thus we find that the Aventine, although inhabited
from early times, was for many centuries
not included within the pomoerium.
The pomoerium was not the same at all times;
as the city increased the pomoerium also was
extended; but this extension could, according
to ancient usage, only be made by such
men as had by their victories over foreign
nations increased the boundaries of the empire,
and neither could a pomoerium be
formed nor altered without the augurs previously
consulting the will of the gods by
augury: hence the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus pomoerii</i> of the augurs.</p>


<p id="Pompa">POMPA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πομπή</span>), a solemn procession, as
on the occasion of a funeral, triumph, &amp;c.
It is, however, more particularly applied to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
the grand procession with which the games
of the circus commenced (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pompa Circensis</i>).
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus">Circus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Pons">PONS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γέφυρα</span>), a bridge. As the rivers of
Greece were small, and the use of the arch
known to them only to a limited extent, it is
probable that the Greek bridges were built
entirely of wood, or, at best, were nothing
more than a wooden platform supported upon
stone piers at each extremity. Pliny mentions
a bridge over the Acheron 1000 feet in
length; we also know that the island Euboea
was joined to Boeotia by a bridge; but the
only existing specimen of a Greek bridge is
the one over a tributary of the Eurotas.
The Romans regularly applied the arch to the
construction of bridges, by which they were
enabled to erect structures of great beauty
and solidity, as well as utility. The width of
the passage-way in a Roman bridge was commonly
narrow, as compared with modern
structures of the same kind, and corresponded
with the road (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via</i>) leading to and from it.
It was divided into three parts. The centre
one, for horses and carriages, was denominated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agger</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">iter</i>; and the raised footpaths
on each side <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decursoria</i>, which were enclosed
by parapet walls similar in use and appearance
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pluteus</i> in the basilica. There
were eight bridges across the Tiber. I. Of
these the most celebrated, as well as the most
ancient, was the <span class="smcap">Pons Sublicius</span>, so called
because it was built of wood; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sublices</i>, in the
language of the Formiani, meaning wooden
beams. It was built by Ancus Martius, when
he united the Janiculum to the city, and was
situated at the foot of the Aventine.&mdash;II.
<span class="smcap">Pons Palatinus</span> formed the communication
between the Palatine and its vicinities and
the Janiculum.&mdash;III. IV. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pons Fabricius</i> and
<span class="smcap">Pons Cestius</span> were the two which connected
the Insula Tiberina with the opposite sides of
the river; the first with the city, and the
latter with the Janiculum.</p>

<p>They formed one of the chief embellishments in all
the public roads; and their frequent and
stupendous remains, still existing in Italy,
Portugal, and Spain, attest, even to the present
day, the scale of grandeur with which
the Roman works of national utility were
always carried on.&mdash;When the comitia were
held, the voters, in order to reach the enclosure
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">septum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ovile</i>, passed over a
wooden platform, elevated above the ground,
which was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons suffragiorum</i>, in order
that they might be able to give their votes
without confusion or collusion. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Comitia">Comitia</a>.</span>]
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pons</i> is also used to signify the platform
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιβάθρα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποβάθρα</span>), used for embarking in,
or disembarking from, a ship.</p>


<p id="Pontifex">PONTĬFEX (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροδιδάσκαλος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερονόμος</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροφύλαξ</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱεροφάντης</span>). The origin of this word
is explained in various ways; but it is probably
formed from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facere</i> (in the
signification of the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥέζειν</span>, to perform
a sacrifice), and consequently signifies the
priests who offered sacrifices upon the bridge.
The ancient sacrifice to which the name thus
alludes, is that of the Argei on the sacred or
sublician bridge. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Argei">Argei</a>.</span>] The Roman pontiffs
formed the most illustrious among the
great colleges of priests. Their institution,
like that of all important matters of religion,
was ascribed to Numa. The number of pontiffs
appointed by this king was four, and at
their head was the pontifex maximus, who is
generally not included when the number of
pontiffs is mentioned. It is probable that
the original number of four pontiffs (not including
the pontifex maximus) had reference
to the two earliest tribes of the Romans, the
Ramnes and Tities, so that each tribe was
represented by two pontiffs. In the year
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 300 the Ogulnian law raised the number
of pontiffs to eight, or, including the
pontifex maximus, to nine, and four of them
were to be plebeians. The pontifex maximus,
however, continued to be a patrician down
to the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 254, when Tib. Coruncanius
was the first plebeian who was invested with
this dignity. This number of pontiffs remained
for a long time unaltered, until in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 81 the dictator Sulla increased it to
fifteen, and J. Caesar to sixteen. In both
these changes the pontifex maximus is included
in the number. During the empire
the number varied, though on the whole
fifteen appears to have been the regular
number. The mode of appointing the pontiffs
was also different at different times. It appears
that after their institution by Numa, the
college had the right of co-optation, that is,
if a member of the college died (for all the
pontiffs held their office for life), the members
met and elected a successor, who, after
his election, was inaugurated by the augurs.
This election was sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">captio</i>.
In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 104 a Lex Domitia was passed, which
transferred the right of electing the members
of the great colleges of priests to the
people (probably in the comitia tributa);
that is, the people elected a candidate, who
was then made a member of the college by
the co-optatio of the priests themselves, so
that the co-optatio, although still necessary,
became a mere matter of form. The Lex
Domitia was repealed by Sulla in a Lex
Cornelia de Sacerdotiis (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 81), which restored
to the great priestly colleges their
full right of co-optatio. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 63 the law
of Sulla was abolished, and the Domitian
law was restored, but not in its full extent;
for it was now determined, that in case of
a vacancy the college itself should nominate
two candidates, and the people elect one of
them. M. Antonius again restored the right
of co-optatio to the college. The college of
pontiffs had the supreme superintendence of
all matters of religion, and of things and
persons connected with public as well as
private worship. They had the judicial decision
in all matters of religion, whether
private persons, magistrates, or priests were
concerned, and in cases where the existing
laws or customs were found defective or
insufficient, they made new laws and regulations
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decreta pontificum</i>), in which they
always followed their own judgment as to
what was consistent with the existing customs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
and usages. The details of these duties
and functions were contained in books called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libri pontificii</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontificales</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">commentarii
sacrorum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacrorum pontificalium</i>, which
they were said to have received from Numa,
and which were sanctioned by Ancus Martius.
As to the rights and duties of the
pontiffs, it must first of all be borne in mind,
that the pontiffs were not priests of any particular
divinity, but a college which stood
above all other priests, and superintended
the whole external worship of the gods.
One of their principal duties was the regulation
of the sacra, both publica and privata,
and to watch that they were observed at the
proper times (for which purpose the pontiffs
had the whole regulation of the calendar,
see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Calendarium">Calendarium</a></span>), and in their proper form.
In the management of the sacra publica they
were in later times assisted in certain duties
by the Triumviri Epulones. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Epulones">Epulones</a>.</span>]
The pontiffs convoked the assembly of the
curies (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia calata</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiata</i>) in cases
where priests were to be appointed, and
flamines or a rex sacrorum were to be inaugurated;
also when wills were to be received,
and when a detestatio sacrorum and adoption
by adrogatio took place. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Adoptio">Adoptio</a>.</span>]
In most cases the sentence of the pontiffs
only inflicted a fine upon the offenders; but
the person fined had the right of appealing
to the people, who might release him from
the fine. In regard to the vestal virgins,
and the persons who committed incest with
them, the pontiffs had criminal jurisdiction,
and might pronounce sentence of death. A
man who had violated a vestal virgin was,
according to an ancient law, scourged to
death by the pontifex maximus in the comitium,
and it appears that originally neither
the vestal virgins nor the male offenders in
such a case had any right of appeal. In
later times we find that, even when the
pontiffs had passed sentence upon vestal
virgins, a tribune interfered, and induced
the people to appoint a quaestor for the purpose
of making a fresh inquiry into the case;
and it sometimes happened that after this
new trial the sentence of the pontiffs was
modified or annulled. Such cases, however,
seem to have been mere irregularities,
founded upon an abuse of the tribunitian
power. In the early times the pontiffs were
in the exclusive possession of the civil as
well as religious law, until the former was
made public by Cn. Flavius. The regulations
which served as a guide to the pontiffs
in their judicial proceedings, formed a large
collection of laws, which was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus
pontificium</i>, and formed part of the Libri
Pontificii. The meetings of the college of
pontiffs, to which in some instances the famines
and the rex sacrorum were summoned,
were held in the curia regia on the Via
Sacra, to which was attached the residence
of the pontifex maximus and of the rex sacrorum.
As the chief pontiff was obliged to
live in a domus publica, Augustus, when he
assumed this dignity, changed part of his
own house into a domus publica. All the
pontiffs were in their appearance distinguished
by the conic cap, called tutulus or
galerus, with an apex upon it, and the toga
praetexta. The pontifex maximus was the
president of the college, and acted in its
name, whence he alone is frequently mentioned
in cases in which he must be considered
only as the organ of the college. He was generally
chosen from among the most distinguished
persons, and such as had held a
curule magistracy, or were already members
of the college. Two of his especial duties
were to appoint (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capere</i>) the vestal virgins
and the flamines [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Vestales">Vestales</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Flamen">Flamen</a></span>], and
to be present at every marriage by confarreatio.
When festive games were vowed,
or a dedication made, the chief pontiff had
to repeat over, before the persons who made
the vow or the dedication, the formula in
which it was to be performed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praeire
verba</i>). During the period of the republic,
when the people exercised sovereign power
in every respect, we find that if the pontiff,
on constitutional or religious grounds, refused
to perform this solemnity, he might
be compelled by the people. The pontifex
maximus wrote down what occurred in his
year on tablets, which were hung up in his
dwelling for the information of the people,
and called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annales Maximi</i>. A pontifex
might, like all the members of the great
priestly colleges, hold any other military,
civil, or priestly office, provided the different
offices did not interfere with one another.
Thus we find one and the same person being
pontiff, augur, and decemvir sacrorum; instances
of a pontifex maximus being at the
same time consul are very numerous. But
whatever might be the civil or military office
which a pontifex maximus held beside his
pontificate, he was not allowed originally to
leave Italy. The college of pontiffs continued
to exist until the overthrow of paganism.
The emperors themselves were always
chief pontiffs, and as such the presidents of
the college; hence the title of pontifex maximus
(P. M. or PON. M.) appears on several
coins of the emperors. If there were several
emperors at a time, only one bore the title
of pontifex maximus; but in the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
238 we find that each of the two emperors
Maximus and Balbinus assumed this dignity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
From the time of Theodosius the emperors
no longer appear with the dignity of pontiff;
but at last the title was assumed by the
Christian bishop of Rome.&mdash;There were other
pontiffs at Rome, who were distinguished by
the epithet <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minores</i>. They appear to have
been originally only the secretaries of the
pontiffs; and when the real pontiffs began to
neglect their duties, and to leave the principal
business to be done by their secretaries,
it became customary to designate these
scribes by the name of Pontifices Minores.
The number of these secretaries is uncertain.</p>

the people, when the inhabitants of Ficulae,
Fidenae, and other places round about, appeared
in arms against Rome shortly after
the departure of the Gauls, and produced
such a panic that the Romans suddenly fled

<p id="Poristae">PŎRISTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πορισταί</span>), magistrates at

<p id="Porta">PORTA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύλη</span>, <em>dim.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυλίς</span>), the gate of a
city, citadel, or other open space inclosed by
a wall, in contradistinction to <span class="smcap"><a href="#Janua">Janua</a></span>, which
was the door of a house or any covered edifice.
The terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porta</i> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύλη</span> are often
found in the plural, even when applied to a
single gate, because it consisted of two leaves.
The gates of a city were of course various in
their number and position. Thus Megara
had 5 gates; Thebes, in Boeotia, had 7;
Athens had 8; and Rome 20, or perhaps
even more. The jambs of the gate were
surmounted, 1. by a lintel, which was large
and strong in proportion to the width of the
gate. 2. By an arch, as we see exemplified
at Pompeii, Paestum, Sepianum, Volterra,
Suza, Autun, Besançon, and Treves. 3. At
Arpinum, one of the gates now remaining is
arched, whilst another is constructed with
the stones projecting one beyond another.
Gates sometimes had two passages close together,
the one designed for carriages entering,
and the other for carriages leaving the
city. In other instances we find only one
gate for carriages, but a smaller one on each
side of it (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραπυλίς</span>) for foot-passengers.
When there were no sideways, one of the
valves of the large gate sometimes contained
a wicket (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portula</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυλίς: ῥινοπύλη</span>), large
enough to admit a single person. The gateway
had commonly a chamber (called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυλών</span>)
either on one side or on both, which served
as the residence of the porter or guard. Statues
of the gods were often placed near the
gate, or even within it in the barbican, so as
to be ready to receive the adoration of those
who entered the city.</p>


<p id="Porticus">PORTĬCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στοά</span>), a walk covered with a
roof, and supported by columns, at least on
one side. Such shaded walks and places of
resort are almost indispensable in the southern
countries of Europe, where people live
much in the open air, as a protection from
the heat of the sun and from rain. The
porticoes attached to the temples were either
constructed only in front of them, or went
round the whole building, as is the case in
the so-called Temple of Theseus at Athens.
They were originally intended as places for
those persons to assemble and converse in
who visited the temple for various purposes.
As such temple-porticoes, however, were
found too small, or not suited for the various
purposes of private and public life, most
Grecian towns had independent porticoes,
some of which were very extensive; and in
most of these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stoae</i>, seats (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exedrae</i>) were
placed, that those who were tired might sit
down. They were frequented not only by
idle loungers, but also by philosophers, rhetoricians,
and other persons fond of intellectual
conversation. The Stoic school of philosophy
derived its name from the circumstance,
that the founder of it used to
converse with his disciples in a stoa. The
Romans derived their great fondness for
such covered walks from the Greeks; and as
luxuries among them were carried in everything
to a greater extent than in Greece,
wealthy Romans had their private porticoes,
sometimes in the city itself, and sometimes
in their country-seats. In the public porticoes
of Rome, which were exceedingly numerous
and very extensive (as those around
the Forum and the Campus Martius), a
variety of business was occasionally transacted:
we find that law-suits were conducted
here, meetings of the senate held, goods exhibited
for sale, &amp;c.</p>


<p id="Portisculus">PORTISCŬLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κελευστής</span>), an officer in

<p id="Portitores">PORTĬTŌRES. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Publicani">Publicani</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Portorium">PORTŌRĬUM, a branch of the regular
revenues of the Roman state, consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
the duties paid on imported and exported
goods. A portorium, or duty upon imported
goods, appears to have been paid at a very
early period, for it is said that Valerius Publicola
exempted the plebes from the portoria
at the time when the republic was threatened
with an invasion by Porsena. The time of
its introduction is uncertain; but the abolition
of it, ascribed to Publicola, can only
have been a temporary measure; and as the
expenditure of the republic increased, new
portoria must have been introduced. In
conquered places, and in the provinces, the
import and export duties, which had been
paid there before, were generally not only
retained, but increased, and appropriated to
the aerarium. Sicily, and above all, Asia,
furnished to the Roman treasury large sums,
which were raised as portoria. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 60
all the portoria in the ports of Italy were
done away with by a Lex Caecilia, but were
restored by Julius Caesar and the subsequent
emperors. Respecting the amount of the
import or export duties we have but little
information. In the time of Cicero the portorium
in the ports of Sicily was one-twentieth
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vicesima</i>) of the value of taxable articles;
and it is probable that this was the
average sum raised in all the other provinces.
In the times of the emperors the
ordinary rate of the portorium appears to
have been the fortieth part (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quadragesima</i>)
of the value of imported goods; and at a
later period the exorbitant sum of one-eighth
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">octava</i>) is mentioned. The portorium was,
like all other vectigalia, farmed out by the
censors to the publicani, who collected it
through the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portitores</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Vectigalia">Vectigalia</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Publicani">Publicani</a></span>.]</p>

If a Roman citizen during war came into
the possession of an enemy, he sustained a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diminutio capitis maxima</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Caput">Caput</a></span>], and all
his civil rights were in abeyance. Being
captured by the enemy, he became a slave;
but his rights over his children, if he had
any, were not destroyed, but were said to be
in abeyance (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pendere</i>) by virtue of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus
Postliminii</i>: when he returned, his children
were again in his power; and if he died in
captivity, they became sui juris. Sometimes
by an act of the state a man was given up
bound to an enemy, and if the enemy would
not receive him, it was a question whether
he had the Jus Postliminii. This was the
case with Sp. Postumius, who was given up
to the Samnites, and with C. Hostilius Mancinus,
who was given up to the Numantines;
but the better opinion was, that they had no
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jus Postliminii</i>, and Mancinus was restored
to his civic rights by a lex. It appears that
the Jus Postliminii was founded on the fiction
of the captive having never been absent from
home; a fiction which was of easy application,
for, as the captive during his absence
could not do any legal act, the interval of
captivity was a period of legal non-activity,
which was terminated by his showing himself
again.</p>

<p id="Praecones">PRAECŌNES, criers, were employed for
various purposes: 1. In sales by auction, they
frequently advertised the time, place, and
conditions of sale: they seem also to have
acted the part of the modern auctioneer, so
far as calling out the biddings and amusing
the company, though the property was
knocked down by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister auctionis</i>.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Auctio">Auctio</a>.</span>] 2. In all public assemblies they
ordered silence. 3. In the comitia they
called the centuries one by one to give their
votes, pronounced the vote of each century,
and called out the names of those who were
elected. They also recited the laws that
were to be passed. 4. In trials, they summoned
the accuser and the accused, the
plaintiff and defendant. 5. In the public
games, they invited the people to attend,
and proclaimed the victors. 6. In solemn
funerals they also invited people to attend
by a certain form; hence these funerals were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funera indictiva</i>. 7. When things
were lost, they cried them and searched for
them. 8. In the infliction of capital punishment,
they sometimes conveyed the commands
of the magistrates to the lictors.
Their office, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praeconium</i>, appears to
have been regarded as rather disreputable:
in the time of Cicero a law was passed preventing
all persons who had been praecones
from becoming decuriones in the municipia.
Under the early emperors, however, it became
very profitable, which was no doubt
partly owing to fees, to which they were
entitled in the courts of justice, and partly
to the bribes which they received from the
suitors, &amp;c.</p>


<p id="Praeda">PRAEDA signifies moveable things taken

office was instituted by Augustus, and was
at first only military, and had comparatively
small power attached to it; but under Tiberius,
who made Sejanus commander of the
praetorian troops, it became of much greater
importance, till at length the power of these
praefects became only second to that of the
emperors. From the reign of Severus to that
of Diocletian, the praefects, like the vizirs
of the east, had the superintendence of all
departments of the state, the palace, the
army, the finances, and the law: they also
had a court in which they decided cases.
The office of praefect of the praetorium was
not confined to military officers; it was filled
by Ulpian and Papinian, and other distinguished
jurists. Originally there were two
praefects; afterwards sometimes one and
sometimes two; from the time of Commodus
sometimes three, and even four. They were,
as a regular rule, chosen only from the equites;

dignity of senator was always joined with
their office.</p>

<p id="Praefectus_u">PRAEFECTUS URBI, praefect or warden

absence of the king from Rome; and then he
acted as the representative of the king: he
convoked the senate, held the comitia, if

take such measures as he thought proper;
in short, he had the imperium in the city.
During the kingly period, the office of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">custos

of consular rank were alone eligible. In the
early period of the republic the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">custos urbis</i>
exercised within the city all the powers of
the consuls, if they were absent: he convoked
the senate, held the comitia, and, in
times of war, even levied civic legions,
which were commanded by him. When the
office of praetor urbanus was instituted, the
wardenship of the city was swallowed up in
it; but as the Romans were at all times
averse to dropping altogether any of their
old institutions, a praefectus urbi, though a
mere shadow of the former office, was henceforth
appointed every year, only for the time
that the consuls were absent from Rome for
the purpose of celebrating the Feriae Latinae.
This praefectus had neither the power
of convoking the senate nor the right of
speaking in it; in most cases he was a person
below the senatorial age, and was not
appointed by the people, but by the consuls.
An office very different from this, though
bearing the same name, was instituted by
Augustus on the suggestion of Maecenas.
This new praefectus urbi was a regular and
permanent magistrate, whom Augustus invested
with all the powers necessary to
maintain peace and order in the city. He
had the superintendence of butchers, bankers,
guardians, theatres, &amp;c.; and to enable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
him to exercise his power, he had distributed
throughout the city a number of
milites stationarii, whom we may compare
to a modern police. His jurisdiction, however,
became gradually extended; and as
the powers of the ancient republican praefectus
urbi had been swallowed up by the
office of the praetor urbanus, so now the
power of the praetor urbanus was gradually
absorbed by that of the praefectus urbi; and
at last there was no appeal from his sentence,
except to the person of the princeps himself,
while any body might appeal from the sentence
of any other city magistrate, and, at a
later period, even from that of a governor of a
province, to the tribunal of the praefectus urbi.</p>

<p id="Praetor">PRAETOR (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατηγός</span>), was originally a
title which designated the consuls as the
leaders of the armies of the state. The
period and office of the command of the consuls
might appropriately be called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praetorium</i>.
Praetor was also a title of office among
the Latins. The first praetor specially so
called was appointed in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 366, and he was
chosen only from the patricians, who had
this new office created as a kind of indemnification
to themselves for being compelled to
share the consulship with the plebeians. No
plebeian praetor was appointed till the year
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 337. The praetor was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">collega
consulibus</i>, and was elected with the same
auspices at the comitia centuriata. The praetorship
was originally a kind of third consulship,
and the chief functions of the praetor
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus in urbe dicere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jura reddere</i>) were a portion
of the functions of the consuls. The
praetor sometimes commanded the armies of
the state; and while the consuls were absent
with the armies, he exercised their functions
within the city. He was a magistratus curulis,
and he had the imperium, and consequently
was one of the magistratus majores:
but he owed respect and obedience to the
consuls. His insignia of office were six lictors;
but at a later period he had only two
lictors in Rome. The praetorship was at first
given to a consul of the preceding year.&mdash;In
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 246 another praetor was appointed,
whose business was to administer justice in
matters in dispute between peregrini, or
peregrini and Roman citizens; and accordingly
he was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetor peregrinus</i>. The
other praetor was then called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetor urbanus,
qui jus inter cives dicit</i>, and sometimes
simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetor urbanus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetor urbis</i>.
The two praetors determined by lot which
functions they should respectively exercise.
If either of them was at the head of the army,
the other performed all the duties of both
within the city. Sometimes the military imperium
of a praetor was prolonged for a
second year. When the territories of the
state were extended beyond the limits of
Italy, new praetors were made. Thus, two
praetors were created <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 227, for the
administration of Sicily and Sardinia, and
two more were added when the two Spanish
provinces were formed, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 197. When
there were six praetors, two stayed in the
city, and the other four went abroad. The
senate determined their provinces, which
were distributed among them by lot. After
the discharge of his judicial functions in the
city, a praetor often had the administration
of a province, with the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propraetor</i>.
Sulla increased the number of praetors to
eight, which Julius Caesar raised successively
to ten, twelve, fourteen, and sixteen. Augustus,
after several changes, fixed the number
at twelve. Under Tiberius there were
sixteen. Two praetors were appointed by
Claudius for matters relating to fideicommissa,
when the business in this department of the
law had become considerable, but Titus reduced
the number to one; and Nerva added
a praetor for the decision of matters between
the fiscus and individuals. Thus there were
eventually eighteen praetors, who administered
justice in the state.&mdash;The praetor urbanus
was specially named praetor, and he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
was the first in rank. His duties confined
him to Rome, as is implied by the name, and
he could only leave the city for ten days at a
time. It was part of his duty to superintend
the Ludi Apollinares. He was also the chief
magistrate for the administration of justice;
and to the edicta of the successive praetors
the Roman law owes in a great degree its
development and improvement. Both the
praetor urbanus and the praetor peregrinus
had the jus edicendi, and their functions in
this respect do not appear to have been limited
on the establishment of the imperial
power, though it must have been gradually
restricted, as the practice of imperial constitutions
and rescripts became common.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Edictum">Edictum</a>.</span>] The chief judicial functions of
the praetor in civil matters consisted in giving
a judex. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Judex">Judex</a>.</span>] It was only in the case
of interdicts that he decided in a summary
way. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Interdictum">Interdictum</a>.</span>] Proceedings before
the praetor were technically said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
jure</i>. The praetors also presided at trials of
criminal matters. These were the quaestiones
perpetuae, or the trials for repetundae,
ambitus, majestas, and peculatus, which,
when there were six praetors, were assigned
to four out of the number. Sulla added to
these quaestiones those of falsum, de sicariis
et veneficis, and de parricidis, and for this
purpose he added two, or, according to some
accounts, four praetors. On these occasions
the praetor presided, but a body of judices
determined by a majority of votes the condemnation
or acquittal of the accused. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Judex">Judex</a>.</span>]
The praetor, when he administered
justice, sat on a sella curulis in a tribunal,
which was that part of the court which was
appropriated to the praetor and his assessors
and friends, and is opposed to the subsellia,
or part occupied by the judices, and others
who were present.</p>


<p id="Praetoria">PRAETŌRĬA CŎHORS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Praetoriani">Praetoriani</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Praetoriani">PRAETŌRĬĀNI, sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">milites</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetoriae
cohortes</i>, a body of troops instituted by Augustus
to protect his person and his power,
and called by that name in imitation of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetoria cohors</i>, or select troops which attended
the person of the praetor or general of
the Roman army. They originally consisted
of nine or ten cohorts, each comprising a
thousand men, horse and foot. Augustus, in
accordance with his general policy of avoiding
the appearance of despotism, stationed
only three of these cohorts in the capital, and
dispersed the remainder in the adjacent
towns of Italy. Tiberius, however, under
pretence of introducing a stricter discipline
among them, assembled them all at Rome in
a permanent camp, which was strongly fortified.
Their number was increased by Vitellius
to sixteen cohorts, or 16,000 men. The
praetorians were distinguished by double pay
and especial privileges. Their term of service
was originally fixed by Augustus at
twelve years, but was afterwards increased
to sixteen years; and when they had served
their time, each soldier received 20,000
sesterces. They soon became the most
powerful body in the state, and, like the
janissaries at Constantinople, frequently deposed
and elevated emperors according to
their pleasure. Even the most powerful of
the emperors were obliged to court their
favour; and they always obtained a liberal
donation upon the accession of each sovereign.
After the death of Pertinax (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
193) they even offered the empire for sale,
which was purchased by Didius Julianus;
but upon the accession of Severus in the
same year they were disbanded, on account
of the part they had taken in the death of
Pertinax, and banished from the city. The
emperors, however, could not dispense with
guards, and accordingly the praetorians were
restored on a new model by Severus, and
increased to four times their ancient number.
Diocletian reduced their numbers and abolished
their privileges; they were still allowed
to remain at Rome, but had no longer the
guard of the emperor’s person, as he never
resided in the capital. Their numbers were
again increased by Maxentius; but after his
defeat by Constantine, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 312, they were
entirely suppressed by the latter, their fortified
camp destroyed, and those who had not
perished in the battle between Constantine
and Maxentius were dispersed among the
legions. The commander of the praetorians
was called <span class="smcap"><a href="#Praefectus_p">Praefectus Praetorio</a></span>.</p>


<p id="Praetorium">PRAETŌRĬUM, the name of the general’s
tent in the camp, and so called because the
name of the chief Roman magistrate was
originally praetor, and not consul. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Castra">Castra</a>.</span>]
The officers who attended on the general in the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetorium</i>, and formed his council of war,
were called by the same name. The word was
also used in several other significations, which
were derived from the original one. Thus
the residence of a governor of a province was
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetorium</i>; and the same name
was also given to any large house or palace.
The camp of the praetorian troops at Rome, and
frequently the praetorian troops themselves,
were called by this name. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Praetoriani">Praetoriani</a>.</span>]</p>

<p id="Probole">PRŎBŎLĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προβολή</span>), an accusation of a
criminal nature, preferred before the people
of Athens in assembly, with a view to obtain
their sanction for bringing the charge before
a judicial tribunal. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probolé</i> was reserved
for those cases where the public had sustained
an injury, or where, from the station, power,
or influence of the delinquent, the prosecutor
might deem it hazardous to proceed in the
ordinary way without being authorised by a
vote of the sovereign assembly. In this point
it differed from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eisangelia</i>, that in the
latter the people were called upon either to
pronounce final judgment, or to direct some
peculiar method of trial; whereas, in the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probolé</i> after the judgment of the assembly,
the parties proceeded to trial in the usual
manner. The cases to which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probolé</i> was
applied were, complaints against magistrates
for official misconduct of oppression; against
those public informers and mischief-makers
who were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sycophantae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συκοφάνται</span>);
against those who outraged public decency at
the religious festivals; and against all such
as by evil practices exhibited disaffection to
the state.</p>


<p id="Probouleuma">PRŎBOULEUMA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Boule">Boule</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Probouli">PRŎBOULI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόβουλοι</span>), a name applicable
to any persons who are appointed to consult
or take measures for the benefit of the people.
Ten <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">probouli</i> were appointed at Athens, after
the end of the Sicilian war, to act as a
committee of public safety. Their authority
did not last much longer than a year; for a
year and a half afterwards Pisander and his
colleagues established the council of Four
Hundred, by which the democracy was overthrown.</p>


<p id="Proconsul">PRŌCONSUL (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνθύπατος</span>), an officer who
acted in the place of a consul, without holding
the office of consul itself. The proconsul,
however, was generally one who had held
the office of consul, so that the proconsulship
was a continuation, though a modified one,
of the consulship. The first time when the
imperium of a consul was prolonged, was in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 327, in the case of Q. Publilius Philo,
whose return to Rome would have been
followed by the loss of most of the advantages
that had been gained in his campaign. The
power of proconsul was conferred by a senatusconsultum
and plebiscitum, and was nearly
equal to that of a regular consul, for he had
the imperium and jurisdictio, but it differed
inasmuch as it did not extend over the city
and its immediate vicinity, and was conferred,
without the auspicia, by a mere decree of the
senate and people, and not in the comitia for
elections. When the number of Roman
provinces had become great, it was customary
for the consuls, who during the latter period
of the republic spent the year of their consulship
at Rome, to undertake at its close the
conduct of a war in a province, or its peaceful
administration, with the title of proconsuls.
There are some extraordinary cases on record
in which a man obtained a province with the
title of proconsul without having held the
consulship before. The first case of this kind
occurred in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 211, when young P. Cornelius
Scipio was created proconsul of Spain in
the comitia centuriata.</p>


<p id="Procurator">PRŌCŪRĀTOR, a person who has the
management of any business committed to
him by another. Thus it is applied to a
person who maintains or defends an action
on behalf of another, or, as we should say,
an attorney [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Actio">Actio</a></span>]: to a steward in a family
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Calculator">Calculator</a></span>]: to an officer in the provinces

other provinces [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Provincia">Provincia</a></span>]: to an officer
engaged in the administration of the fiscus
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fiscus">Fiscus</a></span>]: and to various other officers under
the empire.</p>


<p id="Prodigium">PRŌDĬGĬUM, in its widest acceptation,
denotes any sign by which the gods indicated
to men a future event, whether good or evil,
and thus includes omens and auguries of
every description. It is, however, generally
employed in a more restricted sense, to signify
some strange incident or wonderful
appearance which was supposed to herald the
approach of misfortune, and happened under
such circumstances as to announce that the
calamity was impending over a whole community
or nation rather than over private
individuals. The word may be considered
synonymous with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostentum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monstrum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portentum</i>.
Since prodigies were viewed as
direct manifestations of the wrath of heaven,
it was believed that this wrath might be appeased
by prayers and sacrifices duly offered
to the offended powers. This being a matter
which deeply concerned the public welfare,
the necessary rites were in ancient times
regularly performed, under the direction of
the pontifices, by the consuls before they left
the city, the solemnities being called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">procuratio
prodigiorum</i>.</p>


<p id="Prodosia">PRODŎSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προδοσία</span>) included not only
every species of treason, but also every such
crime as (in the opinion of the Greeks) would
amount to a betraying or desertion of the
interest of a man’s country. The highest
sort of treason was the attempt to establish a
despotism (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τυραννίς</span>), or to subvert the constitution
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταλύειν τὴν πολιτείαν</span>), and in democracies
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταλύειν τὸν δῆμον</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ πλῆθος</span>. Other
kinds of treason were a secret correspondence
with a foreign enemy; a betraying of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
important trust, such, as a fleet, army, or
fortress, a desertion of post, a disobedience of
orders, or any other act of treachery, or breach
of duty in the public service. But not only
would <em>overt acts</em> of disobedience or treachery
amount to the crime of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προδοσία</span>, but also the
neglect to perform those active duties which
the Greeks in general expected of every good
citizen. Cowardice in battle (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δειλία</span>) would
be an instance of this kind; so would any
breach of the oath taken by the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔφηβοι</span> at
Athens; or any line of conduct for which a
charge of disaffection to the people (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μισοδημία</span>)
might be successfully maintained.
The regular punishment appointed by the
law for most kinds of treason appears to have
been death, which, no doubt, might be mitigated
by decree of the people, as in the case
of Miltiades and many others. The goods of
traitors, who suffered death, were confiscated,
and their houses razed to the ground; nor
were they permitted to be buried in the
country, but had their bodies cast out in some
place on the confines of Attica and Megara.
Therefore it was that the bones of Themistocles,
who had been condemned for treason,
were brought over and buried secretly by his
friends. The posterity of a traitor became
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄτιμοι</span>, and those of a tyrant were liable to
share the fate of their ancestor.</p>

in the time of Sulla it assumed a very different
meaning, for he applied it to a measure

sale of the property of those who were put to

called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proscripti</i>. After this example

<p id="Prostates_t">PRŎSTĂTĒS TOU DĒMOU (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάτης τοῦ
δήμου</span>), a leader of the people, denoted at
Athens and in other democratical states, a
person who by his character and eloquence
placed himself at the head of the people, and
whose opinion had the greatest sway amongst
them: such was Pericles. It appears, however,
that <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάτης τοῦ δήμου</span> was also the
title of a public officer in those Dorian states
in which the government was democratical.</p>


<p id="Prothesmia">PRŎTHESMĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προθεσμία</span>), the term limited

appears to have been limited to five years at
Athens.</p>


<p id="Provincia">PRŌVINCĬA. This word is merely a
shortened form of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">providentia</i>, and was frequently
used in the sense of “a duty” or
“matter entrusted to a person.” But it is
ordinarily employed to denote a part of the
Roman dominion beyond Italy, which had a
regular organisation, and was under Roman
administration. Livy likewise uses the word
to denote a district or enemy’s country,
which was assigned to a general as the field
of his operations, before the establishment of
any provincial governments.&mdash;The Roman
state in its complete development consisted
of two parts with a distinct organisation,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Italia</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Provinciae</i>. There were no
Provinciae in this sense of the word till the
Romans had extended their conquests beyond
Italy; and Sicily was the first country that
was made a Roman province: Sardinia was
made a province <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 235. The Roman province
of Gallia Ulterior in the time of Caesar
was sometimes designated simply by the term
Provincia, a name which has been perpetuated
in the modern Provence. A conquered country
received its provincial organisation either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
from the Roman commander, whose acts required
the approval of the senate; or the
government was organised by the commander
and a body of commissioners appointed by
the senate out of their own number. The
mode of dealing with a conquered country
was not uniform. When constituted a provincia,
it did not become to all purposes an
integral part of the Roman state; it retained
its national existence, though it lost its sovereignty.
The organisation of Sicily was
completed by P. Rupilius with the aid of ten
legates. The island was formed into two
districts, with Syracuse for the chief town of
the eastern and Lilybaeum of the western
district: the whole island was administered
by a governor annually sent from Rome.
He was assisted by two quaestors, and was
accompanied by a train of praecones, scribae,
haruspices, and other persons, who formed
his cohors. The quaestors received from the
Roman aerarium the necessary sums for the
administration of the island, and they also
collected the taxes, except those which were
farmed by the censors at Rome. One quaestor
resided at Lilybaeum, and the other with the
governor or praetor at Syracuse. For the
administration of justice the island was divided
into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fora</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conventus</i>, which were
territorial divisions. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Conventus">Conventus</a>.</span>] The island
was bound to furnish and maintain soldiers
and sailors for the service of Rome, and to
pay tributum for the carrying on of wars.
The governor could take provisions for the
use of himself and his cohors on condition of
paying for them. The Roman state had also
the portoria which were let to farm to Romans
at Rome. The governor had complete
jurisdictio in the island, with the imperium
and potestas. He could delegate these powers
to his quaestors, but there was always an
appeal to him, and for this and other purposes
he made circuits through the different
conventus.&mdash;Such was the organisation of
Sicilia as a province, which may be taken as
a sample of the general character of Roman
provincial government. The governor, upon
entering on his duties, published an edict,
which was often framed upon the Edictum
Urbanum. Cicero, when proconsul of Cilicia,
says that on some matters he framed an
edict of his own, and that as to others he
referred to the Edicta Urbana. There was
one great distinction between Italy and the
provinces as to the nature of property in
land. Provincial land could not be an object
of Quiritarian ownership, and it was accordingly
appropriately called Possessio. Provincial
land could be transferred without the
forms required in the case of Italian land,
but it was subject to the payment of a land-tax
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vectigal</i>).&mdash;The Roman provinces up to
the battle of Actium are: Sicilia, Sardinia
et Corsica; Hispania Citerior et Ulterior;
Gallia Citerior; Gallia Narbonensis et Comata;
Illyricum; Macedonia; Achaia;
Asia; Cilicia; Syria; Bithynia et Pontus;
Cyprus; Africa; Cyrenaica et Creta; Numidia;
Mauritania. Those of a subsequent
date, which were either new or arose from
division, are: Rhaetia; Noricum; Pannonia;
Moesia; Dacia; Britannia; Mauritania
Caesariensis and Tingitana; Aegyptus; Cappadocia;
Galatia; Rhodus; Lycia; Commagene;
Judaea; Arabia; Mesopotamia;
Armenia; Assyria.&mdash;At first praetors were
appointed as governors of provinces, but
afterwards they were appointed to the government
of provinces, upon the expiration
of their year of office at Rome, and with the
title of propraetores. In the later times of
the republic, the consuls also, after the expiration
of their year of office, received the
government of a province, with the title of
proconsules: such provinces were called consulares.
The provinces were generally distributed
by lot, but the distribution was sometimes
arranged by agreement among the persons
entitled to them. By a Sempronian Lex
the proconsular provinces were annually determined
before the election of the consuls,
the object of which was to prevent all disputes.
A senatus consultum of the year 55 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
provided that no consul or praetor should
have a province till after the expiration of
five years from the time of his consulship or
praetorship. A province was generally held
for a year, but the time was often prolonged.
When a new governor arrived in his province,
his predecessor was required to leave
it within thirty days. The governor of a
province had originally to account at Rome
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad urbem</i>) for his administration, from his
own books and those of his quaestors; but
after the passing of a Lex Julia, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 61, he
was bound to deposit two copies of his accounts
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rationes</i>) in the two chief cities of his
province, and to forward one (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">totidem verbis</i>)
to the aerarium. If the governor misconducted
himself in the administration of the
province, the provincials applied to the Roman
senate, and to the powerful Romans
who were their patroni. The offences of
repetundae and peculatus were the usual
grounds of complaint by the provincials;
and if a governor had betrayed the interests
of the state, he was also liable to the penalties
attached to majestas. Quaestiones were established
for inquiries into these offences;
yet it was not always an easy matter to bring
a guilty governor to the punishment that he
deserved.&mdash;With the establishment of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
imperial power under Augustus, a considerable
change was made in the administration
of the provinces. Augustus took the charge
of those provinces where a large military
force was required; the rest were left to the
care of the senate and the Roman people.
Accordingly we find in the older jurists the
division of provinciae into those which were
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propriae populi Romani</i>, and those which
were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propriae Caesaris</i>; and this division,
with some modifications, continued to the
third century. The senatorian provinces
were distributed among consulares and those
who had filled the office of praetor, two provinces
being given to the consulares and the
rest to the praetorii: these governors were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proconsules</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praesides</i>, which latter
is the usual term employed by the old jurists
for a provincial governor. The praesides had
the jurisdictio of the praetor urbanus and
the praetor peregrinus: and their quaestors
had the same jurisdiction that the curule
aediles had at Rome. The imperial provinces
were governed by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legati Caesaris</i>, with praetorian
power, the proconsular power being
in the Caesar himself, and the legati being
his deputies and representatives. The legati
were selected from those who had been consuls
or praetors, or from the senators. They
held their office and their power at the pleasure
of the emperor; and he delegated to
them both military command and jurisdictio,
just as a proconsul in the republican period
delegated these powers to his legati. These
legati had also legati under them. No quaestors
were sent to the provinces of the Caesar.
In place of the quaestors, there were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">procuratores
Caesaris</i>, who were either equites
or freedmen of the Caesar. Egypt was governed
by an eques with the title of praefectus.
The procuratores looked after the
taxes, paid the troops, and generally were
intrusted with the interests of the fiscus.
Judaea, which was a part of the province
of Syria, was governed by a procurator, who
had the powers of a legatus. It appears that
there were also procuratores Caesaris in the
senatorian provinces, who collected certain
dues of the fiscus, which were independent
of what was due to the aerarium. The regular
taxes, as in the republican period, were
the poll-tax and land-tax. The taxation was
founded on a census of persons and property,
which was established by Augustus. The
portoria and other dues were farmed by the
publicani, as in the republican period.</p>

<p id="Prytaneium">PRỸTĂNEIUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρυτανεῖον</span>), the public
hall or town-hall in a Greek state. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytaneia</i> of the ancient Greek states and
cities were to the communities living around
them, what private houses were to the families
which occupied them. Just as the house
of each family was its home, so was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytaneium</i>
of every state or city the common
home of its members or inhabitants. This
correspondence between the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytaneium</i> or
home of the city, and the private home of
a man’s family, was at Athens very remarkable.
A perpetual fire was kept burning on
the public altar of the city in the prytaneium,
just as in private houses a fire was
kept up on the domestic altar in the inner
court of the house. Moreover, the city of
Athens exercised in its prytaneium the duties
of hospitality, both to its own citizens and to
strangers. Thus foreign ambassadors were
entertained here, as well as Athenian envoys,
on their return home from a successful or
well-conducted mission. Here, too, were entertained
from day to day the successive prytanes
or presidents of the senate, together
with those citizens who, whether from personal
or ancestral services to the state, were
honoured with what was called the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σίτησις ἐν
πρυτανείῳ</span>, or the privilege of taking their
meals there at the public cost. This was
granted sometimes for a limited period, sometimes
for life, in which latter case the parties
enjoying it were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀείσιτοι</span>. Moreover,
from the ever-burning fire of the prytaneium,
or home of a mother state, was carried the
sacred fire which was to be kept burning in
the prytaneia of her colonies; and if it happened
that this was ever extinguished, the
flame was rekindled from the prytaneium of
the parent city. Lastly, a prytaneium was
also a distinguishing mark of an independent
state. The prytaneium of Athens lay under
the Acropolis on its northern side (near the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγορά</span>), and was, as its name denotes, originally
the place of assembly of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytanes</i>;
in the earliest times it probably stood on the
Acropolis. Officers called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytanes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρυτανεῖς</span>)
were entrusted with the chief magistracy
in several states of Greece, as Corcyra,
Corinth, Miletus. At Athens they were in
early times probably a magistracy of the
second rank in the state (next to the archon),
acting as judges in various cases (perhaps in
conjunction with him), and sitting in the
prytaneium. That this was the case is rendered
probable by the fact, that even in after-times
the fees paid into court by plaintiff and
defendant, before they could proceed to trial,
and received by the dicasts, were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prytaneia</i>.</p>

the praetores, whose duty it was to collect
the debts, and erase the name of the party
when he had paid it. If they made a false
entry, either wilfully, or upon the suggestion
of another person, the aggrieved party might
institute a prosecution against them, or
against the person upon whose suggestion it
was made. Such prosecution was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ

<p id="Publicani">PUBLĬCĀNI, farmers of the public revenues
of the Roman state (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vectigalia</i>). Their
name is formed from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">publicum</i>, which signifies
all that belongs to the state, and is sometimes
used by Roman writers as synonymous
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vectigal</i>. The revenues which Rome
derived from conquered countries, consisting
chiefly of tolls, tithes, harbour duties, the
scriptura, or the tax which was paid for the
use of the public pasture lands, and the duties
paid for the use of mines and salt-works (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salinae</i>),
were let out, or, as the Romans expressed
it, were sold by the censors in Rome itself to
the highest bidder. This sale generally took
place in the month of Quinctilis, and was
made for a lustrum. The terms on which
the revenues were let, were fixed by the censors
in the so-called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leges censoriae</i>. The
people or the senate, however, sometimes
modified the terms fixed by the censors, in
order to raise the credit of the publicani;
and in some cases even the tribunes of the
people interfered in this branch of the administration.
The tithes raised in the province
of Sicily alone, with the exception of those of
wine, oil, and garden produce, were not sold
at Rome, but in the districts of Sicily itself,
according to a practice established by Hiero.
The persons who undertook the farming of
the public revenue of course belonged to the
wealthiest Romans, and during the latter
period of the republic they belonged almost
exclusively to the equestrian order. Their
wealth and consequent influence may be seen
from the fact, that as early as the second
Punic war, after the battle of Cannae, when
the aerarium was entirely exhausted, the
publicani advanced large sums of money to
the state, on condition of repayment after
the end of the war. The words equites and
publicani are sometimes used as synonymous.
The publicani had to give security to the
state for the sum at which they bought one or
more branches of the revenue in a province;
but as for this reason the property of even
the wealthiest individual must have been inadequate,
a number of equites generally
united together, and formed a company (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socii</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">societas</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus</i>), which was recognised by
the state, and by which they were enabled to
carry on their undertakings upon a large
scale. Such companies appear as early as the
second Punic war. The shares which each
partner of such a company took in the business
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">partes</i>, and if they were
small, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">particulae</i>. The responsible person in
each company, and the one who contracted
with the state, was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manceps</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Manceps">Manceps</a></span>];
but there was also a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister</i> to
manage the business of each society, who
resided at Rome, and kept an extensive correspondence
with the agents in the provinces.
He seems to have held his office only for one
year; his representative in the provinces was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub magistro</i>, who had to travel about,
and superintend the actual business of collecting
the revenues. Nobody but a Roman citizen
was allowed to become a member of a company
of publicani; freedmen and slaves were
excluded. No Roman magistrate, however,
or governor of a province, was allowed to
take any share whatever in a company of
publicani, a regulation which was chiefly
intended as a protection against the oppression
of the provincials. The collection of
the taxes in the provinces was performed by
an inferior class of men, who were said
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">operas publicanis dare</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">esse in operis societatis</i>.
They were engaged by the publicani,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
and consisted of freemen as well as slaves,
Romans as well as provincials. The separate
branches of the public revenue in the provinces
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decumae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">portoria</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptura</i>, and the
revenues from the mines and salt-works)
were mostly leased to separate companies of
publicani; whence they were distinguished
by names derived from that particular branch
which they had taken in farm; <em>e.g.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decumani</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecuarii</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scripturarii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salinarii</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipes salinarum</i>, &amp;c. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Decumae">Decumae</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Portorium">Portorium</a></span>;

to the same class as the publicans of the New
Testament.</p>

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυγμοσύνη</span>), boxing, was one of the earliest
athletic games among the Greeks, and is
frequently mentioned in Homer. In the
earliest times boxers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pugiles</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύκται</span>) fought
naked, with the exception of a girdle (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζῶμα</span>)
round their loins; but this was not used
when boxing was introduced at Olympia, as
the contests in wrestling and racing had been
carried on there by persons entirely naked
ever since Ol. 15. Respecting the leathern
thongs with which pugilists surrounded their
fists, see Cestus, where its various forms are
illustrated by woodcuts. The Ionians, especially
those of Samos, were at all times more
distinguished pugilists than the Dorians, and
at Sparta boxing is said to have been forbidden
by the laws of Lycurgus. But the
ancients generally considered boxing as a
useful training for military purposes, and a
part of education no less important than any
other gymnastic exercise.</p>

<p id="Puteal">PŬTĔAL, properly means the enclosure

at the top, to preserve the memory of the
place. The form of this puteal is preserved
on several coins of the Scribonian gens.
This puteal seems to have been near the
atrium of Vesta, and was a common place of
meeting for usurers. The other puteal was
in the comitium, on the left side of the senate-house,
and in it were deposited the whetstone
and razor of <span class="smcap">Attus Navius</span>.</p>

<p id="Pyanepsia">PỸANEPSIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυανέψια</span>), a festival celebrated
at Athens every year on the seventh
of Pyanepsion, in honour of Apollo, said to
have been instituted by Theseus after his

<p id="Pythia">PȲTHĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύθια</span>), one of the four great
national festivals of the Greeks. It was
celebrated in the neighbourhood of Delphi,
anciently called Pytho, in honour of Apollo,
Artemis, and Leto. The place of this solemnity
was the Crissaean plain, which for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
this purpose contained a hippodromus or
race-course, a stadium of 1000 feet in length,
and a theatre, in which the musical contests
took place. The Pythian games were, according
to most legends, instituted by Apollo
himself. They were originally perhaps nothing
more than a religious panegyris, occasioned
by the oracle of Delphi, and the
sacred games are said to have been at first
only a musical contest, which consisted in
singing a hymn to the honour of the Pythian
god, with the accompaniment of the cithara.
They must, on account of the celebrity of the
Delphic oracle, have become a national festival
for all the Greeks at a very early period,
and gradually all the various contests were
introduced which occur in the Olympic games.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Olympia">Olympia</a>.</span>] Down to Ol. 48. the Delphians
had been the agonothetae at the Pythian
games; but in the third year of this Olympiad,
after the Crissaean war, the Amphictyons
took the management under their care,
and appointed certain persons, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epimeletae</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιμεληταί</span>), to conduct them. Some of
the ancients date the institution of the
Pythian games from this time. Previous to
Ol. 48. the Pythian games had been an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐνναετηρίς</span>,
that is, they had been celebrated at the
end of every eighth year; but in Ol. 48. 3.
they became, like the Olympia, a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πενταετηρίς</span>,
<em>i.e.</em> they were held at the end of every fourth
year; and a Pythiad, therefore, from the
time that it was used as an aera, comprehended
a space of four years, commencing
with the third year of every Olympiad.
They were in all probability held in the
spring, and took place in the month of Bucatius,
which corresponded to the Attic Munychion.</p>

<p id="Quaestor">QUAESTOR (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμίας</span>), a name given to two
distinct classes of Roman officers. It is
derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quaero</i>, and Varro gives a
definition which embraces the principal functions
of both classes of officers: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaestores a
quaerendo, qui conquirerent publicas pecunias
et maleficia</i>. The one class, therefore, had
to do with the collecting and keeping of the
public revenues, and the others were a kind
of public accusers. The former bore the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaestores Classici</i>, the latter of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaestores Parricidii</i>.&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaestores Parricidii</i>
were public accusers, two in number,
who conducted the accusation of persons
guilty of murder or any other capital offence,
and carried the sentence into execution. In
the early period of the republic the quaestores
parricidii appear to have become a
standing office, which, like others, was held
only for one year. They were appointed by
the populus or the curies on the presentation
of the consuls. When these quaestores
discovered that a capital offence had been
committed, they had to bring the charge
before the comitia for trial. When the
sentence had been pronounced by the people,
the quaestores parricidii executed it; thus
they threw Spurius Cassius from the Tarpeian
rock. They were mentioned in the laws of
the Twelve Tables, and after the time of the
decemvirate they still continued to be appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
though probably no longer by the
curies, but either in the comitia centuriata or
tribute, which they therefore must have had
the right of assembling in cases of emergency.
From the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 366 they are no longer
mentioned in Roman history, as their functions
were gradually transferred to the
triumviri capitales. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Triumviri">Triumviri Capitales</a>.</span>]&mdash;The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaestores Classici</i>, usually called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaestores</i>
simply, were officers entrusted with the
care of the public money. They were elected
by the centuries, and the office is said to
have been first instituted by Valerius Publicola.
They were at first only two in number,
and of course taken only from the patricians.
As the senate had the supreme administration
of the finances, the quaestors were in some
measure only its agents or paymasters, for
they could not dispose of any part of the
public money without being directed by the
senate. Their duties consequently consisted
in making the necessary payments from the
aerarium, and receiving the public revenues.
Of both they had to keep correct accounts in
their <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae publicae</i>. Demands which any
one might have on the aerarium, and outstanding
debts, were likewise registered by
them. Fines to be paid to the public treasury
were registered and exacted by them. Another
branch of their duties, which, however, was
likewise connected with the treasury, was to
provide the proper accommodation for foreign
ambassadors, and such persons as were connected
with the republic by ties of public hospitality.&mdash;In
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 421 the number of quaestors was
doubled, and the tribunes tried to effect, by
an amendment of the law, that a part (probably
two) of the quaestores should be plebeians.
This attempt was indeed frustrated, but the
interrex L. Papirius effected a compromise,
that the election should not be restricted to
either order. After this law was carried,
eleven years passed without any plebeian
being elected to the office: at last, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
409, three of the four quaestors were plebeians.
A person who had held the office of
quaestor had undoubtedly, as in later times,
the right to take his seat in the senate, unless
he was excluded as unworthy by the next
censors. And this was probably the reason
why the patricians so resolutely opposed the
admission of plebeians to this office. Henceforth
the consuls, whenever they took the
field against an enemy, were accompanied
by one quaestor each, who at first had only
to superintend the sale of the booty, the
produce of which was either divided among
the legion, or was transferred to the aerarium.
Subsequently, however, we find that these
quaestors also kept the funds of the army,
which they had received from the treasury at
Rome, and gave the soldiers their pay; they
were in fact the paymasters of the army.
The two other quaestors, who remained at
Rome, continued to discharge the same duties
as before, and were distinguished from those
who accompanied the consuls by the epithet
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbani</i>. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 265, after the Romans had
made themselves masters of Italy, and when,
in consequence, the administration of the
treasury and the raising of the revenues
became more laborious and important, the
number of quaestors was again doubled to
eight; and it is probable that henceforth
their number continued to be increased in
proportion as the empire became extended.
One of the eight quaestors was appointed by
lot to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaestura Ostiensis</i>, a most laborious
and important post, as he had to provide
Rome with corn. Besides the quaestor
Ostiensis, who resided at Ostia, three other
quaestors were distributed in Italy, to raise
those parts of the revenue which were not
farmed by the publicani, and to control the
latter. One of them resided at Cales, and
the two others probably in towns on the
Upper Sea. The two remaining quaestors
were sent to Sicily.&mdash;Sulla, in his dictatorship,
raised the number of quaestors to
twenty, that he might have a large number
of candidates for the senate, and J. Caesar
even to forty. In the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 49 no quaestors
were elected, and Caesar transferred the
keeping of the aerarium to the aediles. From
this time forward the treasury was sometimes
entrusted to the praetors, sometimes to the
praetorii, and sometimes again to quaestors.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aerarium">Aerarium</a>.</span>] Quaestors, however, both in
the city and in the provinces, occur down to
the latest period of the empire. The proconsul
or praetor, who had the administration
of a province, was attended by a quaestor.
This quaestor had undoubtedly to perform
the same functions as those who accompanied
the armies into the field; they were in fact
the same officers, with the exception that the
former were stationary in their province
during the time of their office, and had consequently
rights and duties which those who
accompanied the armies could not have. In
the provinces the quaestors had the same
jurisdiction as the curule aediles at Rome.
The relation existing between a praetor or
proconsul of a province and his quaestor was,
according to ancient custom, regarded as
resembling that between a father and his
son. When a quaestor died in his province,
the praetors had the right of appointing a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proquaestor</i> in his stead; and when the
praetor was absent, the quaestor supplied his
place, and was then attended by lictors. In
what manner the provinces were assigned to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
the quaestors after their election at Rome,
is not mentioned, though it was probably
by lot, as in the case of the quaestor Ostiensis.</p>

<p id="Quinquatrus">QUINQUATRUS or QUINQUATRĬA, a
festival sacred to Minerva, which was celebrated
on the 19th of March. Ovid says
that it was celebrated for five days, that on
the first day no blood was shed, but that on
the last four there were contests of gladiators.
It would appear, however, that only the first
day was the festival properly so called, and
that the last four were merely an addition
made perhaps in the time of Caesar, to gratify
the people, who became so passionately fond
of gladiatorial combats. On the fifth day of
the festival, according to Ovid, the trumpets
used in sacred rites were purified; but this
seems to have been originally a separate
festival called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tubilustrium</i>, which was celebrated,
as we know from the ancient calendars,
on the 23rd of March, and would of
course, when the Quinquatrus was extended
to five days, fall on the last day of that festival.
There was also another festival of this
name, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quinquatrus Minusculae</i> or

commemoration of the flight of king Tarquinius
Superbus from Rome. The day is
marked in the Fasti as nefastus. In some
ancient calendars the 24th of May is likewise
called Regifugium. It is doubtful whether
either of these days had anything to do with
the flight of king Tarquinius: they may have
derived their name from the symbolical flight
of the Rex Sacrorum from the comitium; for
this king-priest was generally not allowed to
appear in the comitium, which was destined
for the transaction of political matters in
which he could not take part. But on certain
days in the year, and certainly on the two
days mentioned above, he had to go to the
comitium for the purpose of offering certain
sacrifices, and immediately after he had performed

<p id="Repetundae">RĔPĔTUNDAE, or PĔCŪNĬAE RĔPĔTUNDAE,
was the term used to designate
such sums of money as the socii of the Roman
state or individuals claimed to recover
from magistratus, judices, or publici curatores,
which they had improperly taken or
received in the Provinciae, or in the Urbs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
Roma, either in the discharge of their jurisdictio,
or in their capacity of judices, or in
respect of any other public function. Sometimes
the word Repetundae was used to express
the illegal act for which compensation
was sought, as in the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">repetundarum
insimulari, damnari</i>; and Pecuniae meant
not only money, but anything that had value.
The first lex on the subject was the Calpurnia,
which was proposed and carried by
the tribunus plebis L. Calpurnius Piso (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
149). By this lex a praetor was appointed
for trying persons charged with this crime.
It seems that the penalties of the Lex Calpurnia
were merely pecuniary, and at least
did not comprise exsilium. Various leges de
repetundis were passed after the Lex Calpurnia,
and the penalties were continually made
heavier. The Lex Junia was passed probably
about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 126, on the proposal of M. Junius
Pennus, tribunus plebis. The Lex Servilia
Glaucia was proposed and carried by C. Servilius
Glaucia, praetor, in the sixth consulship
of Marius, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 100. This lex applied
to any magistratus who had improperly taken
or received money from any private person;
but a magistratus could not be accused during
the term of office. The lex enacted that the
praetor peregrinus should annually appoint
450 judices for the trial of this offence:
the judices were not to be senators. The
penalties of the lex were pecuniary and exsilium;
the law allowed a comperendinatio.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Judex">Judex</a>.</span>] Before the Lex Servilia, the pecuniary
penalty was simply restitution of what
had been wrongfully taken; this lex seems
to have raised the penalty to double the
amount of what had been wrongfully taken;
and subsequently it was made quadruple.
Exsilium was only the punishment in case a
man did not abide his trial, but withdrew
from Rome. The lex gave the civitas to any
person on whose complaint a person was convicted
of repetundae. The Lex Acilia, which
seems to be of uncertain date, was proposed
and carried by M’. Acilius Glabrio, a tribune
of the plebs, and enacted that there should be
neither ampliatio nor comperendinatio. The
Lex Cornelia was passed in the dictatorship
of Sulla, and continued in force to the time of
C. Julius Caesar. It extended the penalties
of repetundae to other illegal acts committed
in the provinces, and to judices who received
bribes, to those to whose hands the money
came, and to those who did not give into the
aerarium their proconsular accounts (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proconsulares
rationes</i>). The praetor who presided
over this quaestio chose the judges by lot
from the senators, whence it appears that the
Servilia Lex was repealed by this lex, at
least so far as related to the constitution of
the court. This lex also allowed ampliatio
and comperendinatio. The penalties were
pecuniary (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litis aestimatio</i>) and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquae et
ignis interdictio</i>. Under this lex were tried
L. Dolabella, Cn. Piso, C. Verres, C. Macer,
M. Fonteius, and L. Flaccus, the two last of
whom were defended by Cicero. In the Verrine
Orations Cicero complains of the comperendinatio
or double hearing of the cause,
which the Lex Cornelia allowed, and refers to
the practice under the Lex Acilia, according
to which the case for the prosecution, the
defence, and the evidence were only heard
once, and so the matter was decided. The
last lex de repetundis was the Lex Julia,
passed in the first consulship of C. Julius
Caesar, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 59. This lex repealed the penalty
of exsilium, but in addition to the litis aestimatio,
it enacted that persons convicted under
this lex should lose their rank, and be disqualified
from being witnesses, judices, or
senators. The lex had been passed when
Cicero made his oration against Piso, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 55.
A. Gabinius was convicted under this lex.
Under the empire the offence was punishable
with exile.</p>

<p id="Retis">RĒTIS and RĒTE; <em>dim.</em> RĒTĬCŬLUM
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκτυον</span>), a net. Nets were made most commonly
of flax or hemp, whence they are sometimes
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lina</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λίνα</span>). The meshes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maculae</i>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βρόχοι</span>, <em>dim.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βροχίδες</span>) were great or
small according to the purposes intended.
By far the most important application of net-work
was to the three kindred arts of fowling,
hunting, and fishing. In fowling the use of
nets was comparatively limited. In hunting
it was usual to extend nets in a curved line
of considerable length, so as in part to surround
a space into which the beasts of chace,
such as the hare, the boar, the deer, the
lion, and the bear, were driven through the
opening left on one side. This range of nets
was flanked by cords, to which feathers dyed
scarlet and of other bright colours were tied,
so as to flare and flutter in the wind. The
hunters then sallied forth with their dogs,
dislodged the animals from their coverts, and
by shouts and barking drove them first
within the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">formido</i>, as the apparatus of string
and feathers was called, and then, as they
were scared with this appearance, within the
circuit of the nets. In the drawing below
three servants with staves carry on their
shoulders a large net, which is intended to be
set up as already described. In the lower
figure the net is set up. At each end of it
stands a watchman holding a staff. Being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
intended to take such large quadrupeds as
boars and deer (which are seen within it),
the meshes are very wide (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">retia rara</i>). The
net is supported by three stakes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στάλικες</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ancones</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vari</i>). To dispose the nets in this
manner was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">retia ponere</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">retia tendere</i>.
Comparing it with the stature of the
attendants, we perceive the net to be between
five and six feet high. The upper border of
the net consists of a strong rope, which was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαρδών</span>. Fishing-nets (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁλιευτικὰ δίκτυα</span>)
were of different kinds. Of these the
most common were the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφίβληστρον</span>, or
casting-net (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funda</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jaculum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">retinaculum</i>)

<p id="Rex">REX (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεύς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄναξ</span>), king.&mdash;(1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>
In the heroic age, as depicted in the poems of
Homer, the kingly form of government was
universal. The authority of these kings and
its limitations were derived not from any definite
scheme, or written code, but from the
force of traditionary usage, and the natural
influence of the circumstances in which the
kings were placed, surrounded as they were
by a body of chiefs or nobles, whose power
was but little inferior to that of the kings
themselves. Even the title <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλῆες</span> is applied
to them as well as to the king. The
maintenance of regal authority doubtless depended
greatly on the possession of personal
superiority in bravery, military prowess,
wisdom in council and eloquence in debate.
When old age had blunted his powers and
activity, a king ran a great chance of losing
his influence. There was, however, an undefined
notion of a sort of divine right connected
with the kingly office, whence the
epithet <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διοτρεφής</span>, so commonly applied to
kings in Homer. The characteristic emblem
of the kingly office was the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκῆπτρον</span>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Sceptrum">Sceptrum</a>.</span>]
Our information respecting the
Grecian kings in the more historical age is
not ample or minute enough to enable us to
draw out a detailed scheme of their functions.
Respecting the kings of Sparta the reader is
referred to the article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Ephori">Ephori</a></span>. As an illustration
of the gradual limitation of the prerogatives
of the king or chief magistrate, the
reader may consult the article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Archon">Archon</a></span>. The
title <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Basileus</i> was sometimes applied to an
officer who discharged the priestly functions
of the more ancient kings, as in Athens.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Archon">Archon</a>.</span>]&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span> Rome was originally
governed by kings. All the ancient
writers agree in representing the king as
elected by the people for life, and as voluntarily
entrusted by them with the supreme
power in the state. No reference is made to
the hereditary principle in the election of the
first four kings; and it is not until the fifth
king Tarquinius Priscus obtained the sovereignty,
that anything is said about the
children of the deceased king. Since the
people had conferred the regal power, it
returned to them upon the death of the king.
But as a new king could not be immediately
appointed, an Interrex forthwith stepped into
his place. The necessity for an immediate
successor to the king arose from the circumstance
that he alone had had the power of
taking the auspicia on behalf of the state;
and as the auspicia devolved upon the people
at his death, it was imperative upon them to
create a magistrate, to whom they could
delegate the auspicia, and who would thus
possess the power of mediating between the
gods and the state. Originally the people
consisted only of the patres or patricii; and
accordingly on the death of the king, we read
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res ad patres redit</i>, or, what is nearly the
same thing, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicia ad patres redeunt</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Augur">Augur</a>.</span>]
The interrex was elected by the whole
body of the patricians, and he appointed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prodebat</i>)
his successor, as it was a rule that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
first interrex could not hold the comitia for
the election; but it frequently happened that
the second interrex appointed a third, the
third a fourth, and so on, till the election took
place. The Interrex presided over the comitia
curiata, which were assembled for the election
of the king. The person whom the senate had
selected was proposed by the interrex to the
people in a regular <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rogatio</i>, which the people
could only accept or reject, for they had not
the initiative and could not themselves propose
any name. If the people voted in favour
of the rogation, they were said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">creare regem</i>,
and their acceptance of him was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jussus
populi</i>. But the king did not immediately
enter upon his office. Two other acts had
still to take place before he was invested with
the full regal authority and power. First,
his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inauguratio</i> had to be performed, as it
was necessary to obtain the divine will respecting
his appointment by means of the
auspices, since he was the high priest of the
people. This ceremony was performed by an
augur, who conducted the newly-elected king
to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arx</i>, or citadel, and there placed him
on a stone seat with his face turned to the
south, while the people waited below in
anxious suspense until the augur announced
that the gods had sent the favourable tokens
confirming the king in his priestly character.
The inauguratio did not confer upon him the
auspicia; for these he obtained by his election
to the royalty, as the comitia were held
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auspicato</i>. The second act which had to be
performed was the conferring of the imperium
upon the king. The curiae had only determined
by their previous vote who was to be
king, and had not by that act bestowed the
necessary power upon him; they had, therefore,
to grant him the imperium by a distinct
vote. Accordingly the king himself proposed
to the curiae a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex curiata de imperio</i>, and
the curiae by voting in favour of it gave him
the imperium. Livy in his first book makes
no mention of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex curiata de imperio</i>, but
he uses the expressions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores fierent</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres auctores facti</i>; but these expressions
are equivalent to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex curiata de imperio</i>
in the kingly period.&mdash;The king possessed
the supreme power in the earliest times, and
the senate and the comitia of the curiae were
very slight checks upon its exercise. In the
first place, the king alone possessed the right
of taking the auspices on behalf of the state;
and as no public business of any kind could
be performed without the approbation of the
gods expressed by the auspices, the king
stood as mediator between the gods and the
people, and in an early stage of society must
necessarily have been regarded with religious
awe. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Augur">Augur</a>.</span>] Secondly, the people surrendered
to the king the supreme military
and judicial authority by conferring the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium</i>
upon him. The king was not only
the commander in war, but the supreme
judge in peace. Seated on his throne in the
comitium, he administered justice to all
comers, and decided in all cases which were
brought before him, civil as well as criminal.
Again, all the magistrates in the kingly
period appear to have been appointed by the
king and not elected by the curiae. Further,
the king was not dependent upon the people
for his support; but a large portion of the
ager publicus belonged to him, which was
cultivated at the expense of the state on his
behalf. He had also the absolute disposal of
the booty taken in war and of the conquered
lands. It must not, however, be supposed
that the authority of the king was absolute.
The senate and the assembly of the people
must have formed some check upon his power.
But these were not independent bodies possessing
the right of meeting at certain times
and discussing questions of state. They could
only be called together when the king chose,
and further could only determine upon matters
which the king submitted to them. The
only public matter in which the king could
not dispense with the co-operation of the
senate and the curiae was in declarations of
war. There is no trace of the people having
had anything to do with the conclusion of
treaties of peace.&mdash;The insignia of the king
were the fasces with the axes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secures</i>), which
twelve lictors carried before him as often as he
appeared in public, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trabea</i>, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sella curulis</i>,
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">picta</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trabea</i>
appears to have been the most ancient official
dress, and is assigned especially to Romulus:
it was of Latin origin, and is therefore
represented by Virgil as worn by the
Latin kings. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">picta</i>
were borrowed, together with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sella curulis</i>,
from the Etruscans, and their introduction
is variously ascribed to Tullus Hostilius or
Tarquinius Priscus.</p>


<p id="Rex_s">REX SACRĬFĬCŬLUS, REX SACRĬFĬCUS,
or REX SACRORUM. When the civil
and military powers of the king were transferred
to two praetors or consuls, upon the
establishment of the republican government
at Rome, these magistrates were not invested
with that part of the royal dignity by virtue
of which the king had been the high priest
of his nation and had conducted several
of the sacra publica, but this priestly part
of his office was transferred to a priest
called Rex Sacrificulus or Rex Sacrorum.
The first rex sacrorum was designated, at the
command of the consuls, by the college of
pontiffs, and inaugurated by the augurs. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
was always elected and inaugurated in the
comitia curiata under the presidency of the
pontiffs, and as long as a rex sacrificulus was
appointed at Rome, he was always a patrician,
for as he had no influence upon the
management of political affairs, the plebeians
never coveted this dignity. Considering that
this priest was the religious representative of
the kings, he ranked indeed higher than all
other priests, and even higher than the
pontifex maximus, but in power and influence
he was far inferior to him. He held his
office for life, was not allowed to hold any
civil or military dignity, and was at the same
time exempted from all military and civil
duties. His principal functions were: 1. To
perform those sacra publica which had before
been performed by the kings; and his wife,
who bore the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">regina sacrorum</i>, had
also, like the queens of former days, to perform
certain priestly functions. These sacra
publica he or his wife had to perform on all
the Calends, Ides, and the Nundines; he to
Jupiter, and she to Juno in the regia. 2. On
the days called regifugium he had to offer a
sacrifice in the comitium. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Regifugium">Regifugium</a>.</span>]
3. When extraordinary portenta seemed to
announce some general calamity, it was his
duty to try to propitiate the anger of the gods.
4. On the nundines, when the people assembled
in the city, the rex sacrorum announced
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">edicebat</i>) to them the succession of the festivals
for the month. This part of his functions,
however, must have ceased after the time of
Cn. Flavius. He lived in a domus publica on
the via sacra, near the regia and the house of
the vestal virgins.</p>


<p id="Rheda">RHĒDA or RĒDA, a travelling carriage
with four wheels. Like the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Covinus">Covinus</a></span> and the
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Esseda">Essedum</a></span> it was of Gallic origin, and may
perhaps contain the same root as the German
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reiten</i> and our <em>ride</em>. It was the common
carriage used by the Romans for travelling,
and was frequently made large enough not
only to contain many persons, but also baggage
and utensils of various kinds. The
word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epirhedium</i>, which was formed by the
Romans from the Greek preposition <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπι</span> and
the Gallic <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rheda</i>, is explained by the Scholiast
on Juvenal as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ornamentum rhedarum aut
plaustrum</span>.”</p>


<p id="Rhetrae">RHĒTRAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥῆτραι</span>), specially the name of
the ordinances of Lycurgus. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rhetra</i>
means a solemn compact, either originally
emanating from, or subsequently sanctioned
by the gods, who are always parties to such
agreements. The Rhetra of Lycurgus emanated
from the Delphian god: but the kings,
senators, and people all bound themselves,
both to each other and to the gods, to
obey it.</p>


<p id="Rhyton">RHYTON (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ῥυτόν</span>), a drinking-horn (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κέρας</span>).
Its original form was probably the horn of
the ox, but one end of it was afterwards
ornamented with the heads of various animals
and birds. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rhyton</i> had a small
opening at the bottom, which the person who
drank put into his mouth, and allowed the
wine to run in: hence it derived its name.</p>

The sacrifices offered on this occasion consisted
of the entrails of a dog and a sheep,
accompanied with frankincense and wine:
a prayer was presented by a flamen in the
grove of the ancient deity, whom Ovid and
Columella make a goddess. A god Robigus
or a goddess Robigo is a mere invention from
the name of this festival, for the Romans
paid no divine honours to evil deities.</p>

<p id="Rostra">ROSTRA, or The Beaks, was the name applied
to the stage (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suggestus</i>) in the Forum,
from which the orators addressed the people.
This stage was originally called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum</i>, because
it was consecrated by the augurs, but
obtained its name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rostra</i> at the conclusion
of the great Latin war, when it was adorned
with the beaks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rostra</i>) of the ships of the
Antiates. The Greeks also mutilated galleys
in the same way for the purpose of trophies:
this was called by them <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρωτηριάζειν</span>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Acroterium">Acroterium</a>.</span>]
The rostra lay between the Comitium
or place of meeting for the curies, and
the Forum or place of meeting for the tribes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
so that the speaker might turn either to the
one or the other; but down to the time of
C. Gracchus, even the tribunes in speaking
used to front the Comitium; he first turned
his back to it and spoke with his face towards
the forum. The rostra was a circular building,
raised on arches, with a stand or platform
on the top, bordered by a parapet, the
access to it being by two flights of steps, one
on each side. It fronted towards the comitium,
and the rostra were affixed to the front
of it, just under the arches. Its form has
been in all the main points preserved in the
ambones or circular pulpits of the most ancient
churches, which also had two flights of
steps leading up to them, one on the east
side, by which the preacher ascended, and
another on the west side, for his descent.
The speaker was thus enabled to walk to
and fro, while addressing his audience. The
suggestus or rostra was transferred by Julius
Caesar to a corner of the Forum, but the
spot where the ancient rostra had stood still
continued to be called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rostra Vetera</i>, while
the other was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rostra Nova</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rostra
Julia</i>. Both the rostra contained statues of
illustrious men.</p>

<p id="Saccus" class="drop-capy">SACCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάκκος</span>) signified in general any

signifies a small place consecrated to a god,

<p id="Sacerdos">SĂCERDOS, SĂCERDŌTĬUM. As all the
different kinds of priests are treated of separately
in this work, it is only necessary here
to make some general remarks. In comparison
with the civil magistrates, all priests
at Rome were regarded as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homines privati</i>,
though all of them, as priests, were sacerdotes
publici, in as far as their office (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacerdotium</i>)
was connected with any worship recognised
by the state. The appellation of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacerdos
publicus</i> was, however, given principally to
the chief pontiff and the flamen dialis, who
were at the same time the only priests who
were members of the senate by virtue of
their office. All priestly offices or sacerdotia
were held for life, without responsibility to
any civil magistrate. A priest was generally
allowed to hold any other civil or military
office besides his priestly dignity; some
priests, however, formed an exception, for
the duumviri, the rex sacrorum, and the
flamen dialis were not allowed to hold any
state office, and were also exempt from
service in the armies. Their priestly character
was, generally speaking, inseparable
from their person as long as they lived:
hence the augurs and fratres arvales retained
their character even when sent into exile, or
when they were taken prisoners. It also
occurs that one and the same person held
two or three priestly offices at a time. Thus
we find the three dignities of pontifex maximus,
augur, and decemvir sacrorum united
in one individual. Bodily defects incapacitated
a person at Rome, as among all ancient
nations, from holding any priestly office. All
priests were originally patricians, but from
the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 367 the plebeians also began to
take part in the sacerdotia [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Plebes">Plebes</a></span>]; and
those priestly offices which down to the latest
times remained in the hands of the patricians
alone, such as that of the rex sacrorum, the
flamines, salii, and others, had no influence
upon the affairs of the state. As regards the
appointment of priests, the ancients unanimously
state, that at first they were appointed
by the kings, but after the sacerdotia were
once instituted, each college of priests&mdash;for
nearly all priests constituted certain corporations
called collegia&mdash;had the right of filling
up, by cooptatio, the vacancies which occurred.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pontifex">Pontifex</a>.</span>] Other priests, on the
contrary, such as the vestal virgins and the
flamines, were appointed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capiebantur</i>) by
the pontifex maximus, a rule which appears
to have been observed down to the latest
times; others again, such as the duumviri
sacrorum, were elected by the people, or by
the curiae, as the curiones. But in whatever
manner they were appointed, all priests after
their appointment required to be inaugurated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
by the pontiffs and the augurs, or by the
latter alone. Those priests who formed colleges
had originally, as we have already
observed, the right of cooptatio; but in the
course of time they were deprived of this
right, or at least the cooptatio was reduced
to a mere form, by several leges, called leges
de sacerdotiis, such as the Lex Domitia, Cornelia,
and Julia; their nature is described in
the article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pontifex">Pontifex</a></span>, and what is there said
in regard to the appointment of pontiffs applies
equally to all the other colleges. All
priests had some external distinction, as the
apex, tutulus, or galerus, the toga praetexta,
as well as honorary seats in the theatres,
circuses, and amphitheatres. Most of the
priestly colleges possessed landed property,
and some priests had also a regular annual
salary (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stipendium</i>), which was paid to them
from the public treasury. This is expressly
stated in regard to the vestal virgins, the
augurs, and the curiones, and may therefore
be supposed to have been the case with other
priests also. The pontifex maximus, the rex
sacrorum, and the vestal virgins had moreover
a domus publica as their place of residence.</p>


<p id="Sacra">SACRA. This word, in its widest sense,
expresses what we call divine worship. In
ancient times, the state, as well as all its
subdivisions, had their own peculiar forms
of worship, whence at Rome we find sacra
of the whole Roman people, of the curies,
gentes, families, and even of private individuals.
All these sacra, however, were
divided into two great classes, the public
and private sacra (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacra publica et privata</i>),
that is, they were performed either on behalf
of the whole nation, and at the expense of
the state, or on behalf of individuals, families,
or gentes, which had also to defray their
expenses. This division is ascribed to Numa.
All sacra, publica as well as privata, were
superintended and regulated by the pontiffs.</p>


<p id="Sacramentum">SACRĀMENTUM, the military oath, which
was administered in the following manner:&mdash;Each
tribunus militum assembled his legion,
and picked out one of the men, to whom
he put the oath, that he would obey the
commands of his generals, and execute them
punctually. The other men then came forward,
one after another, and repeated the same
oath, saying that they would do like the first.</p>


<p id="Sacrarium">SACRĀRĬUM was any place in which sacred
things were deposited and kept, whether this
place was a part of a temple or of a private house.</p>


<p id="Sacrificium">SACRIFĬCĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερεῖον</span>), a sacrifice. Sacrifices
or offerings formed the chief part of the
worship of the ancients. They were partly
signs of gratitude, partly a means of propitiating
the gods, and partly also intended to
induce the deity to bestow some favour upon
the sacrificer, or upon those on whose behalf
the sacrifice was offered. Sacrifices in a
wider sense would also embrace the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Donaria">Donaria</a></span>;
in a narrower sense sacrificia were
things offered to the gods, which merely
afforded momentary gratification, and which
were burnt upon their altars, or were believed
to be consumed by the gods. All sacrifices
may be divided into bloody sacrifices
and unbloody sacrifices.&mdash;<em>Bloody sacrifices.</em>
In the early times of Greece we find mention
of human sacrifices, but with a few exceptions
these had ceased in the historical ages.
Owing to the influence of civilisation, in
many cases animals were substituted for human
beings; in others, a few drops of human
blood were thought sufficient to propitiate
the gods. The custom of sacrificing human
life to the gods arose from the belief that the
nobler the sacrifice and the dearer to its
possessor, the more pleasing it would be to
the gods. Hence the frequent instances in
Grecian story of persons sacrificing their own
children, or of persons devoting themselves
to the gods of the lower world. That the
Romans also believed human sacrifices to be
pleasing to the gods, might be inferred from
the story of Curtius and from the self-sacrifice
of the Decii. The symbolic sacrifice of
human figures made of rushes at the Lemuralia
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lemuria">Lemuralia</a></span>] also shows that in the
early history of Italy human sacrifices were
not uncommon. For another proof of this
practice, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Ver">Ver Sacrum</a></span>. A second kind of
bloody sacrifices were those of animals of
various kinds, according to the nature and
character of the divinity. The sacrifices of
animals were the most common among the
Greeks and Romans. The victim was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερεῖον</span>, and in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hostia</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">victima</i>. In
the early times it appears to have been the
general custom to burn the whole victim
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁλοκαυτεῖν</span>) upon the altars of the gods, and
the same was in some cases also observed in
later times. But as early as the time of
Homer it was the almost general practice to
burn only the legs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μηροί, μηρία, μῆρα</span>) enclosed
in fat, and certain parts of the intestines,
while the remaining parts of the victim
were consumed by men at a festive meal.
The gods delighted chiefly in the smoke
arising from the burning victims, and the
greater the number of victims, the more
pleasing was the sacrifice. Hence it was not
uncommon to offer a sacrifice of one hundred
bulls (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑκατόμβη</span>) at once, though it must not
be supposed that a hecatomb always signifies
a sacrifice of a hundred bulls, for the name
was used in a general way to designate any
great sacrifice. Such great sacrifices were
not less pleasing to men than to the gods,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
for in regard to the former they were in
reality a donation of meat. Hence at Athens
the partiality for such sacrifices rose to the
highest degree. The animals which were
sacrificed were mostly of the domestic kind,
as bulls, cows, sheep, rams, lambs, goats,
pigs, dogs, and horses; and each god had
his favourite animals which he liked best as
sacrifices. The head of the victim, before it
was killed, was in most cases strewed with
roasted barley meal (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐλόχυτα</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐλοχύται</span>)
mixed with salt (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mola salsa</i>). The persons
who offered the sacrifice wore generally garlands
round their heads, and sometimes also
carried them in their hands, and before they
touched anything belonging to the sacrifice
they washed their hands in water. The
victim itself was likewise adorned with garlands,
and its horns were sometimes gilt.
Before the animal was killed, a bunch of
hair was cut from its forehead, and thrown
into the fire as primitiae (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατάρχεσθαι</span>). In
the heroic ages the princes, as the high
priests of their people, killed the victim; in
later times this was done by the priests themselves.
When the sacrifice was to be offered
to the Olympic gods, the head of the animal
was drawn heavenward; when to the gods
of the lower world, to heroes, or to the dead,
it was drawn downwards. While the flesh
was burning upon the altar, wine and incense
were thrown upon it, and prayers and
music accompanied the solemnity. The most
common animal sacrifices at Rome were the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suovetaurilia</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solitaurilia</i>, consisting of a
pig, a sheep, and an ox. They were performed
in all cases of a lustration, and the
victims were carried around the thing to be
lustrated, whether it was a city, a people, or
a piece of land. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lustratio">Lustratio</a>.</span>] The Greek
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trittya</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριττύα</span>), which likewise consisted of
an ox, a sheep, and a pig, was the same sacrifice
as the Roman suovetaurilia. The
customs observed before and during the
sacrifice of an animal were on the whole the
same as those observed in Greece. But the
victim was in most cases not killed by the
priests who conducted the sacrifice, but by a
person called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popa</i>, who struck the animal
with a hammer before the knife was used.
The better parts of the intestines (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exta</i>) were
strewed with barley meal, wine, and incense,
and were burnt upon the altar. Those parts
of the animal which were burnt were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prosecta</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prosiciae</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ablegmina</i>. When a
sacrifice was offered to gods of rivers, or of
the sea, these parts were not burnt, but
thrown into the water. Respecting the use
which the ancients made of sacrifices to learn
the will of the gods, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Haruspices">Haruspex</a></span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Divinatio">Divinatio</a></span>.&mdash;<em>Unbloody
sacrifices.</em> Among these we
may first mention the libations (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libationes</i>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοιβαί</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σπονδαί</span>). Bloody sacrifices were
usually accompanied by libations, as wine
was poured upon them. The wine was
usually poured out in three separate streams.
Libations always accompanied a sacrifice
which was offered in concluding a treaty
with a foreign nation, and that here they
formed a prominent part of the solemnity, is
clear from the fact that the treaty itself was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σπονδαί</span>. But libations were also made
independent of any other sacrifice, as in solemn
prayers, and on many other occasions
of public and private life, as before drinking
at meals, and the like. Libations usually
consisted of unmixed wine (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔνσπονδος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">merum</i>),
but sometimes also of milk, honey, and
other fluids, either pure or diluted with
water. The libations offered to the Furies
were always without wine. Incense was
likewise an offering which usually accompanied
bloody sacrifices, but it was also burned
as an offering for itself. A third class of
unbloody sacrifices consisted of fruit and
cakes. The former were mostly offered to
the gods as primitiae or tithes of the harvest,
and as a sign of gratitude. They were sometimes
offered in their natural state, sometimes
also adorned or prepared in various
ways. Cakes were peculiar to the worship
of certain deities, as to that of Apollo. They
were either simple cakes of flour, sometimes
also of wax, or they were made in the shape
of some animal, and were then offered as symbolical
sacrifices in the place of real animals,
either because they could not easily be procured,
or were too expensive for the sacrificer.</p>


<p id="Sacrilegium">SACRĬLĔGĬUM, the crime of stealing things
consecrated to the gods, or things deposited in
a consecrated place. A Lex Julia appears to
have placed the crime of sacrilegium on an
equality with peculatus. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Peculatus">Peculatus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Saeculum">SAECŬLUM was, according to the calculation
of the Etruscans, which was adopted
by the Romans, a space of time containing
110 lunar years. The return of each saeculum
at Rome was announced by the pontiffs,
who also made the necessary intercalations
in such a manner, that at the commencement
of a new saeculum the beginning of
the ten months’ year, of the twelve months’
year, and of the solar year coincided. But
in these arrangements the greatest caprice
and irregularity appear to have prevailed
at Rome, as may be seen from the unequal
intervals at which the ludi saeculares were
celebrated. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Saeculares">Ludi Saeculares</a>.</span>] This also
accounts for the various ways in which a
saeculum was defined by the ancients; some
believed that it contained thirty, and others
that it contained a hundred years: the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
opinion appears to have been the most common
in later times, so that saeculum answered
to our century.</p>


<p id="Sagittarii">SĂGITTĀRĬI. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Arcus">Arcus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Sagmina">SAGMĬNA, were the same as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbenae</i>,
namely, herbs torn up by their roots from
within the inclosure of the Capitoline, which
were always carried by the Fetiales or ambassadors,
when they went to a foreign
people to demand restitution for wrongs
committed against the Romans, or to make a
treaty. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fetiales">Fetiales</a>.</span>] They served to mark
the sacred character of the ambassadors, and
answered the same purpose as the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κηρύκεια</span>.</p>


<p id="Sagum">SĂGUM, the cloak worn by the Roman
soldiers and inferior officers, in contradistinction
to the paludamentum of the general
and superior officers. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Paludamentum">Paludamentum</a>.</span>] It
is used in opposition to the toga or garb of
peace, and we accordingly find, that when
there was a war in Italy, all citizens put on
the sagum even in the city, with the exception
of those of consular rank (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saga sumere</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad saga ire</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in sagis esse</i>). The sagum was
open in the front, and usually fastened across
the shoulders by a clasp: it resembled in
form the paludamentum (see cut, <a href="#ill281b">p. 281</a>).
The cloak worn by the general and superior
officers is sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sagum</i>, but the
diminutive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sagulum</i> is more commonly used in
such cases. The cloak worn by the northern
nations of Europe is also called sagum. The
German sagum is mentioned by Tacitus: that
worn by the Gauls seems to have been a species
of plaid (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versicolor sagum</i>).</p>


<p id="Salaminia">SĂLĂMINĬA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Paralus">Paralus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Salii">SĂLĬI, priests of Mars Gradivus, said to
have been instituted by Numa. They were
twelve in number, chosen from the patricians
even in the latest times, and formed an ecclesiastical
corporation. They had the care of
the twelve Ancilia, which were kept in the
temple of Mars on the Palatine hill, whence
these priests were sometimes called Salii Palatini,
to distinguish them from the other
Salii mentioned below. The distinguishing
dress of the Salii was an embroidered tunic
bound with a brazen belt, the trabea, and
the apex, also worn by the Flamines. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Apex">Apex</a>.</span>]
Each had a sword by his side, and in his
right hand a spear or staff. The festival of
Mars was celebrated by the Salii on the 1st
of March and for several successive days; on
which occasion they were accustomed to go
through the city in their official dress, carrying
the ancilia in their left hands or suspended
from their shoulders, and at the same
time singing and dancing, whence comes
their name. The songs or hymns which
they sang on this occasion were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asamenta,
ssamenta</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Axamenta</i>, and were
chiefly in praise of Mamurius Veturius, generally
said to be the armourer, who made
eleven ancilia like the one that was sent
from heaven (ancile), though some modern
writers suppose it to be merely another name
of Mars. The praises of the gods were also
celebrated in the songs of the Salii. In later
times these songs were scarcely understood
even by the priests themselves. At the conclusion
of the festival the Salii were accustomed
to partake of a splendid entertainment
in the temple of Mars, which was proverbial
for its excellence. The members of the collegium
were elected by co-optation. We read
of the dignities of praesul, vates, and magister
in the collegium. The shape of the
ancile is exhibited in the annexed cut, which
illustrates the accounts of the ancient writers
that its form was oval, but with the two
sides receding inwards with an even curvature,
and so as to make it broader at the
ends than in the middle. The persons engaged
in carrying these ancilia on their
shoulders, suspended from a pole, are probably
servants of the Salii. At the top of
the cut is represented one of the rods with
which the Salii were accustomed to beat the
shield in their dance, as already described.</p>

  <div class="caption">Salii carrying the Ancilia. (From an ancient Gem.)</div>
</div>

<p>Tullus Hostilius established another collegium
of Salii, in fulfilment of a vow which
he made in a war with the Sabines. These
Salii were also twelve in number, chosen
from the patricians, and appear to have been
dedicated to the service of Quirinus. They
were called the Salii Collini, Agonales or
Agonenses. It is supposed that the oldest
and most illustrious college, the Palatine
Salii, were chosen originally from the oldest
tribe, the Ramnes, and the one instituted by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
Tullus Hostilius, or the Quirinalian, from
the Tities alone: a third college for the Luceres
was never established.</p>


<p id="Salinae">SĂLĪNAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁλαὶ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἁλοπήγιον</span>), a salt-work.
Throughout the Roman empire the salt-works
were commonly public property, and were
let by the government to the highest bidder.
The first salt-works are said to have been
established by Ancus Marcius at Ostia. The
publicani who farmed these works appear to
have sold this most necessary of all commodities
at a very high price, whence the
censors M. Livius and C. Claudius (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 204)
fixed the price at which those who took the
lease of them were obliged to sell the salt to
the people. At Rome the medius was, according
to this regulation, sold for a sextans,
while in other parts of Italy the price was
higher and varied. The salt-works in Italy
and in the provinces were very numerous.</p>


<p id="Salinum">SĂLĪNUM, a salt-cellar. All Romans who
were raised above poverty had one of silver,
which descended from father to son, and was
accompanied by a silver plate, which was
used together with the salt-cellar in the
domestic sacrifices. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Patera">Patera</a>.</span>] These two
articles of silver were alone compatible with
the simplicity of Roman manners in the early
times of the republic.</p>

<p id="Saltatio">SALTĀTĬO (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄρχησις</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀρχηστύς</span>), dancing.
The dancing of the Greeks as well as of the
Romans had very little in common with the
exercise which goes by that name in modern
times. It may be divided into two kinds,
gymnastic and mimetic; that is, it was intended
either to represent bodily activity, or
to express by gestures, movements, and attitudes
certain ideas or feelings, and also single
events, or a series of events, as in the modern
ballet. All these movements, however, were
accompanied by music; but the terms <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄρχησις</span>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saltatio</i> were used in so much wider a
sense than our word dancing, that they were
applied to designate gestures, even when the
body did not move at all. We find dancing
prevalent among the Greeks from the earliest
times. It was originally closely connected
with religion. In all the public festivals,
which were so numerous among the Greeks,
dancing formed a very prominent part. We
find from the earliest times that the worship
of Apollo was connected with a religious
dance, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hyporchema</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπόρχημα</span>). All
the religious dances, with the exception of
the Bacchic and the Corybantian, were very
simple, and consisted of gentle movements of
the body, with various turnings and windings
around the altar: such a dance was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geranus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γέρανος</span>), which Theseus is said to
have performed at Delos on his return from
Crete. The Dionysiac or Bacchic, and the
Corybantian, were of a very different nature.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="ill328a" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill328a.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Corybantian Dance. (Visconti, Mus. Pio Clem., vol. iv. tav. 9.)</div>
</div>

<p>In the former the life and adventures of the
god were represented by mimetic dancing.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Dionysia">Dionysia</a>.</span>] The Corybantian was of a very
wild character: it was chiefly danced in
Phrygia and in Crete; the dancers were
armed, struck their swords against their
shields, and displayed the most extravagant
fury; it was accompanied chiefly by the flute.
Respecting the dances in the theatre, see
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a></span>. Dancing was applied to gymnastic
purposes and to training for war, especially
in the Doric states, and was believed to have
contributed very much to the success of the
Dorians in war, as it enabled them to perform
their evolutions simultaneously and in
order. There were various dances in early
times, which served as a preparation for war:
hence Homer calls the Hoplites <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρυλέες</span>, a
war-dance having been called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρύλις</span> by the
Cretans. Of such dances the most celebrated
was the Pyrrhic (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡ πυῤῥίχη</span>), of which the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρύλις</span> was probably only another name. It
was danced to the sound of the flute, and its
time was very quick and light, as is shown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
by the name of the Pyrrhic foot (˘˘), which
must be connected with this dance. In the
non-Doric states it was probably not practised
as a training for war, but only as a
mimetic dance: thus we read of its being
danced by women to entertain a company.
It was also performed at Athens at the
greater and lesser Panathenaea by ephebi,
who were called Pyrrhichists (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυῤῥιχισταί</span>),
and were trained at the expense of the choragus.
In the mountainous parts of Thessaly
and Macedon dances are performed at the
present day by men armed with muskets and
swords. The Pyrrhic dance was introduced
in the public games at Rome by Julius Caesar,
when it was danced by the children of the
leading men in Asia and Bithynia. There
were other dances, besides the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pyrrhica">Pyrrhic</a></span>, in
which the performers had arms; but these
seem to have been entirely mimetic, and not
practised with any view to training for war.
Such was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carpaea</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καρπαία</span>), peculiar to
the Aenianians and Magnetes, and described
by Xenophon in the Anabasis. Such dances
were frequently performed at banquets for
the entertainment of the guests, where also
the tumblers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυβιστῆρες</span>) were often introduced,
who in the course of their dance flung
themselves on their head and alighted again
upon their feet. These tumblers were also
accustomed to make their somersets over
knives and swords, which was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κυβιστάν
εἰς μαχαίρας</span>. We learn from Tacitus that the
German youths also used to dance among
swords and spears pointed at them. Other
kinds of dances were frequently performed at
entertainments, in Rome as well as in Greece,
by courtezans, many of which were of a very
indecent and lascivious nature. Among the
dances performed without arms one of the
most important was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hormos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅρμος</span>),
which was danced at Sparta by youths and
maidens together: the youth danced first
some movements suited to his age, and of a
military nature; the maiden followed in
measured steps and with feminine gestures.
Another common dance at Sparta was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bibasis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βίβασις</span>), in which the dancer sprang
rapidly from the ground and struck the feet
behind.&mdash;Dancing was common among the
Romans in ancient times, in connection with
religious festivals and rites, because the ancients
thought that no part of the body should
be free from the influence of religion. The
dances of the Salii, which were performed
by men of patrician families, are described
elsewhere. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ancile">Ancile</a>.</span>] Dancing, however,
was not performed by any Roman citizens
except in connection with religion, and it
was considered disgraceful for any freeman
to dance. The mimetic dances of the Romans,
which were carried to such perfection under
the empire, are described under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pantomimus">Pantomimus</a></span>.
The dancers on the tight-rope (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">funambuli</i>)
under the empire were as skilful as they are
in the present day.</p>

visiting the houses of the wealthy early in
the morning, to pay their respects to them
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salutare</i>), and to accompany them when they
went abroad. This arose from the visits
which the clients were accustomed to pay to
their patrons, and degenerated in later times
into the above-mentioned practice: such persons
seem to have obtained a good living
among the great number of wealthy and vain
persons at Rome, who were gratified by this

<p id="Satura_a">SĂTŬRA, the root of which is <em>sat</em>, literally
means a mixture of all sorts of things. The
name was accordingly applied by the Romans
in many ways, but always to things consisting
of various parts or ingredients, <em>e.g.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lanx
satura</i>, an offering consisting of various
fruits, such as were offered at harvest festivals
and to Ceres; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex per saturam lata</i>, a

<p id="Saturnalia">SĀTURNĀLĬA, the festival of Saturnus, to
whom the inhabitants of Latium attributed
the introduction of agriculture and the arts
of civilized life. Falling towards the end of
December, at the season when the agricultural
labours of the year were fully completed,
it was celebrated in ancient times by
the rustic population as a sort of joyous
harvest-home, and in every age was viewed
by all classes of the community as a period of
absolute relaxation and unrestrained merriment.
During its continuance no public
business could be transacted, the law courts
were closed, the schools kept holiday, to
commence a war was impious, to punish a
malefactor involved pollution. Special indulgences
were granted to the slaves of each
domestic establishment; they were relieved
from all ordinary toils, were permitted to
wear the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pileus</i>, the badge of freedom, were
granted full freedom of speech, and partook
of a banquet attired in the clothes of their
masters, and were waited upon by them at
table. All ranks devoted themselves to
feasting and mirth, presents were interchanged
among friends, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerei</i> or wax tapers
being the common offering of the more
humble to their superiors, and crowds
thronged the streets, shouting, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Io Saturnalia</i>
(this was termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clamare Saturnalia</i>), while
sacrifices were offered with uncovered head,
from a conviction that no ill-omened sight
would interrupt the rites of such a happy
day. Many of the peculiar customs of this
festival exhibit a remarkable resemblance to
the sports of our own Christmas and of the
Italian Carnival. Thus on the Saturnalia
public gambling was allowed by the aediles,
just as in the days of our ancestors the most
rigid were wont to countenance card-playing
on Christmas-eve; the whole population
threw off the toga, wore a loose gown, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">synthesis</i>, and walked about with the pileus
on their heads, which reminds us of the
dominos, the peaked caps, and other disguises
worn by masques and mummers; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerei</i>
were probably employed as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">moccoli</i> now
are on the last night of the Carnival; and
lastly, one of the amusements in private
society was the election of a mock king,
which at once calls to recollection the characteristic
ceremony of Twelfth-night. During
the republic, although the whole month of
December was considered as dedicated to
Saturn, only one day, the <span class="allsmcap">XIV.</span> Kal. Jan., was
set apart for the sacred rites of the divinity.
When the month was lengthened by the addition
of two days upon the adoption of the
Julian Calendar, the Saturnalia fell on the
<span class="allsmcap">XVI.</span> Kal. Jan., which gave rise to confusion
and mistakes among the more ignorant portion
of the people. To obviate this inconvenience,
and allay all religious scruples,
Augustus enacted that three whole days, the
17th, 18th, and 19th of December, should in
all time coming be hallowed, thus embracing
both the old and new style. Under the empire
the merry-making lasted for seven days,
and three different festivals were celebrated
during this period. First came the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saturnalia</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
proper, commencing on <span class="allsmcap">XVI.</span> Kal. Dec.,
followed by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Opalia</i>, anciently coincident
with the Saturnalia, on <span class="allsmcap">XIV.</span> Kal. Jan.; these
two together lasted for five days, and the
sixth and seventh were occupied with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sigillaria</i>, so called from little earthenware
figures (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sigilla</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oscilla</i>) exposed for sale at
this season, and given as toys to children.</p>


<p id="Scalptura">SCALPTŪRA or SCULPTŪRA, originally
signified cutting figures out of a solid material,
but was more particularly applied to the
art of cutting figures into the material (intaglios),
which was chiefly applied to producing
seals and matrices for the mints; and 2. the
art of producing raised figures (cameos),
which served for the most part as ornaments.
<em>Sculpture</em> in our sense of the word was
usually designated by the term <span class="smcap"><a href="#Statuaria">Statuaria</a></span>.
The first artist who is mentioned as an engraver
of stones is Theodoras, the son of
Telecles, the Samian, who engraved the stone
in the ring of Polycrates. The most celebrated
among them was Pyrgoteles, who
engraved the seal-rings for Alexander the
Great. Several of the successors of Alexander
and other wealthy persons adopted the custom
of adorning their gold and silver vessels,
craters, candelabras, and the like, with precious
stones on which raised figures (cameos)
were worked. The art was in a particularly
flourishing state at Rome under Augustus
and his successors, in the hands of Dioscurides
and other artists, many of whose works
are still preserved. Numerous specimens of
intaglios and cameos are still preserved in
the various museums of Europe.</p>


<p id="Scamnum">SCAMNUM, <em>dim.</em> SCĂBELLTUM, a step
which was placed before the beds of the
ancients in order to assist persons in getting
into them, as some were very high:
others which were lower required also lower
steps, which were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scabella</i>. A scamnum
was also used as a footstool. A scamnum
extended in length becomes a bench,
and in this sense the word is frequently
used. The benches in ships were sometimes
called scamna.</p>

<p id="Sceptrum">SCEPTRUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκῆπτρον</span>), which originally
denoted a simple staff or walking-stick, was
emblematic of station and authority. In
ancient authors the sceptre is represented as
belonging more especially to kings, princes,
and leaders of tribes: but it is also borne by
judges, by heralds, and by priests and seers.
The sceptre descended from father to son,
and might be committed to any one in order
to express the transfer of authority. Those
who bore the sceptre swore by it, solemnly
taking it in the right hand and raising it
towards heaven. The ivory sceptre of the
kings of Rome, which descended to the consuls,
was surmounted by an eagle.</p>

and Persian measure, the length of which is
stated by Herodotus at 60 stadia, or 2 parasangs.
It was used especially for measuring
land.</p>

<p id="Scribae">SCRĪBAE, public notaries or clerks, in
the pay of the Roman state. They were
chiefly employed in making up the public
accounts, copying out laws, and recording the
proceedings of the different functionaries of
the state. The phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptum facere</i> was
used to denote their occupation. Being very
numerous, they were divided into companies
or classes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decuriae</i>), and were assigned by
lot to different magistrates, whence they
were named Quaestorii, Aedilicii, or Praetorii,
from the officers of state to whom they were
attached. The appointment to the office of a
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriba</span>” seems to have been either made on
the nomination of a magistrate, or purchased.
Horace, for instance, bought for himself a
“patent place as clerk in the treasury”
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptum quaestorium comparavit</i>). In Cicero’s
time, indeed, it seems that any one
might become a scriba or public clerk by
purchase, and consequently, as freedmen and
their sons were eligible, and constituted a
great portion of the public clerks at Rome,
the office was not highly esteemed, though
frequently held by ingenui or free-born citizens.
Very few instances are recorded of
the scribae being raised to the higher dignities
of the state. Cn. Flavius, the scribe of
Appius Claudius, was raised to the office of
curule aedile in gratitude for his making
public the various forms of actions, which
had previously been the exclusive property
of the patricians [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Actio">Actio</a></span>]; but the returning
officer refused to acquiesce in his election
till he had given up his books and left his
profession.</p>

<p id="Scriptura">SCRIPTŪRA, that part of the revenue of
the Roman Republic which was derived from
letting out, as pasture land, those portions of
the ager publicus which were not taken into
cultivation. The names for such parts of the
ager publicus were, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pascua publica</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saltus</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silvae</i>. They were let by the censors to the
publicani, like all other vectigalia; and the
persons who sent their cattle to graze on
such public pastures had to pay a certain tax
or duty to the publicani, which of course
varied according to the number and quality
of the cattle which they kept upon them.
The publicani had to keep the lists of persons
who sent their cattle upon the public pastures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
together with the number and quality
of the cattle. From this registering (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scribere</i>)
the duty itself was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scriptura</i>, the public
pasture land <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ager scripturarius</i>, and the
publicani, or their agents who raised the tax,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scripturarii</i>. The Lex Thoria (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 111) did
away with the scriptura in Italy, where the
public pastures were very numerous and
extensive, especially in Apulia, and the lands
themselves were now sold or distributed. In
the provinces, where the public pastures
were also let out in the same manner, the
practice continued until the time of the empire;
but afterwards the scriptura is no longer
mentioned.</p>


<p id="Scrupulum">SCRŪPŬLUM, or more properly <span class="smcap">Scripulum</span>
or <span class="smcap">Scriplum</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γράμμα</span>), the smallest
denomination of weight among the Romans.

to the form of the human body, by being
made either oval or of the shape of a door,
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύρα</span>), which it also resembled in being
made of wood or wicker-work, and from
which consequently its Greek name was
derived. Polybius says that the dimensions
of the scutum were 4 feet by 2½.</p>

king or general left Sparta, the ephors gave
to him a staff of a definite length and thickness,
and retained for themselves another of
precisely the same size. When they had
any communications to make to him, they cut
the material upon which they intended to
write into the shape of a narrow riband,
wound it round their staff, and then wrote
upon it the message which they had to send
to him. When the strip of writing material
was taken from the staff, nothing but single
letters appeared, and in this state the strip was
sent to the general, who, after having wound
it round his staff, was able to read the communication.</p>

<p id="Sella">SELLA, the general term for a seat or
chair of any description.&mdash;(1) <span id="Sella_cu" class="smcap">Sella Curulis</span>,
the chair of state. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curulis</i> is derived by the
ancient writers from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">currus</i>, but it more
probably contains the same root as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curia</i>.
The sella curulis is said to have been used at
Rome from a very remote period as an emblem
of kingly power, having been imported,
along with various other insignia of royalty,
from Etruria. Under the republic the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
of sitting upon this chair belonged to the
consuls, praetors, curule aediles, and censors;
to the flamen dialis; to the dictator, and to
those whom he deputed to act under himself,
as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister equitum</i>, since he might be
said to comprehend all magistracies within
himself. After <ins class="corr" id="tn-332" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the downfal of'">
the downfall of</ins> the constitution,
it was assigned to the emperors also, or
to their statues in their absence; to the
augustales, and perhaps, to the praefectus
urbi. It was displayed upon all great public
occasions, especially in the circus and theatre;
and it was the seat of the praetor when
he administered justice. In the provinces it
was assumed by inferior magistrates, when
they exercised proconsular or propraetorian
authority. We find it occasionally exhibited
on the medals of foreign monarchs likewise,
as on those of Ariobarzanes II. of Cappadocia,
for it was the practice of the Romans to
present a curule chair, an ivory sceptre, a
toga praetexta, and such-like ornaments, as
tokens of respect and confidence to those
rulers whose friendship they desired to cultivate.
The sella curulis appears from the
first to have been ornamented with ivory; and
at a later period it was overlaid with gold.
In shape it was extremely plain, closely resembling
a common folding camp-stool with
crooked legs. The sella curulis is frequently
represented upon the denarii of Roman families.
In the following cut are represented
two pair of bronze legs, belonging to a sella
curulis, and likewise a sella curulis itself.&mdash;(2)
<span id="Sella_ge" class="smcap">Sella Gestatoria</span>, or <span class="smcap">Fertoria</span>, a
sedan used both in town and country,
and by men as well as by women. It
is expressly distinguished from the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Lectica">Lectica</a></span>,
a portable bed or sofa, in which the person
carried lay in a recumbent position,
while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sella</i> was a portable chair, in
which the occupant sat upright. It differed
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cathedra</i> also, but in what the difference
consisted, it is not easy to determine.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cathedra">Cathedra</a>.</span>] It appears not to have been
introduced until long after the lectica was
common, since we scarcely, if ever, find any
allusion to it until the period of the empire.
The sella was sometimes entirely open, but
more frequently shut in. It was made sometimes
of plain leather, and sometimes ornamented
with bone, ivory, silver, or gold,
according to the fortune of the proprietor.
It was furnished with a pillow to support the
head and neck (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cervical</i>); the motion was so
easy that one might study without inconvenience,
while at the same time it afforded a
healthful exercise.&mdash;(3) Chairs for ordinary
domestic purposes have been discovered in
excavations, or are seen represented in ancient
frescoes, many displaying great taste.</p>

<p id="Senatus">SĔNĀTUS. In all the republics of antiquity
the government was divided between
a senate and a popular assembly; and in
cases where a king stood at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
affairs, as at Sparta and in early Rome, the
king had little more than the executive. A
senate in the early times was always regarded
as an assembly of elders, which is in fact
the meaning of the Roman senatus, as of the
Spartan (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γερουσία</span>), and its members were
elected from among the nobles of the nation.
The number of senators in the ancient republics
always bore a distinct relation to the
number of tribes of which the nation was
composed. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Boule">Boule</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Gerousia">Gerousia</a></span>.] Hence in
the earliest times, when Rome consisted of only
one tribe, its senate consisted of one hundred
members (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatores</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres</i>; compare <span class="smcap"><a href="#Patricii">Patricii</a></span>),
and when the Sabine tribe or the
Tities became united with the Latin tribe or
the Ramnes, the number of senators was increased
to two hundred. This number was
again augmented to three hundred by Tarquinius
Priscus, when the third tribe or the
Luceres became incorporated with the Roman
state. The new senators added by Tarquinius
Priscus were distinguished from those
belonging to the two older tribes by the appellation
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patres minorum gentium</i>, as previously
those who represented the Tities had
been distinguished, by the same name, from
those who represented the Ramnes. Under
Tarquinius Superbus the number of senators
is said to have become very much diminished,
as he is reported to have put many
to death and sent others into exile. This
account however appears to be greatly exaggerated,
and it is probable that several vacancies
in the senate arose from many of the
senators accompanying the tyrant into his
exile. The vacancies which had thus arisen
were filled up immediately after the establishment
of the republic, when several noble
plebeians of equestrian rank were made senators.
These new senators were distinguished
from the old ones by the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Conscripti</i>; and hence the customary mode
of addressing the whole senate henceforth
always was: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patres Conscripti</i>, that is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patres
et Conscripti</i>.&mdash;The number of 300 senators
appears to have remained unaltered
for several centuries. The first permanent
increase to their number was made by Sulla,
and the senate seems henceforth to have consisted
of between five and six hundred.
Julius Caesar augmented the number to 900,
and raised to this dignity even common soldiers,
freedmen, and peregrini. Augustus
cleared the senate of the unworthy members,
who were contemptuously called by the
people <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orcini senatores</i>, and reduced its number
to 600.&mdash;In the time of the kings the
senate was probably elected by the gentes,
each gens appointing one member as its representative;
and as there were 300 gentes,
there were consequently 300 senators. The
whole senate was divided into decuries, each
of which corresponded to a curia. When the
senate consisted of only one hundred members,
there were accordingly only ten decuries
of senators; and ten senators, one
being taken from each decury, formed the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decem Primi</i>, who represented the ten curies.
When subsequently the representatives of
the two other tribes were admitted into the
senate, the Ramnes with their decem primi
retained for a time their superiority over the
two other tribes, and gave their votes first.
The first among the decem primi was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">princeps senatus</i>, who was appointed by the
king, and was at the same time custos urbis.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Praefectus_u">Praefectus urbi</a>.</span>] Respecting the age at
which a person might be elected into the
senate during the kingly period, we know no
more than what is indicated by the name
senator itself, that is, that they were persons
of advanced age.&mdash;Soon after the establishment
of the republic, though at what time is
uncertain, the right of appointing senators
passed from the gentes into the hands of the
consuls, consular tribunes, and subsequently
of the censors. At the same time, the right
which the magistrates possessed of electing
senators was by no means an arbitrary
power, for the senators were usually taken
from among those whom the people had previously
invested with a magistracy, so that
in reality the people themselves always nominated
the candidates for the senate, which
on this account remained, as before, a representative
assembly. After the institution of
the censorship, the censors alone had the
right of introducing new members into the
senate from among the ex-magistrates, and
of excluding such as they deemed unworthy.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Censor">Censor</a>.</span>] The exclusion was effected by
simply passing over the names, and not entering
them on the lists of senators, whence
such men were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praeteriti Senatores</i>.
On one extraordinary occasion the eldest
among the ex-censors was invested with dictatorial
power for the purpose of filling up
vacancies in the senate.&mdash;As all curule magistrates,
and also the quaestors, had by
virtue of their office a seat in the senate,
even if they had not been elected senators,
we must distinguish between two classes of
senators, viz., real senators, or such as had
been regularly raised to their dignity by the
magistrates or the censors, and such as had,
by virtue of the office which they held or
had held, a right to take their seats in the
senate and to speak (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sententiam dicere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus
sententiae</i>), but not to vote. To this ordo
senatorius also belonged the pontifex maximus
and the flamen dialis. Though these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
senators had no right to vote, they might,
when the real senators had voted, step over
or join the one or the other party, whence
they were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senatores Pedarii</i>, an appellation
which had in former times been applied
to those juniores who were not consulars.
When at length all the state offices had become
equally accessible to the plebeians and
the patricians, and when the majority of
offices were held by the former, their number
in the senate naturally increased in proportion.
The senate had gradually become an
assembly representing the people, as formerly
it had represented the populus, and down to
the last century of the republic the senatorial
dignity was only regarded as one conferred
by the people. But notwithstanding this
apparently popular character of the senate,
it was never a popular or democratic assembly,
for now its members belonged to the
nobiles, who were as aristocratic as the patricians.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Nobiles">Nobiles</a>.</span>] The office of princeps
senatus, which had become independent of
that of praetor urbanus, was now given
by the censors, and at first always to the
eldest among the ex-censors, but afterwards
to any other senator whom they thought
most worthy; and unless there was any
charge to be made against him, he was
re-elected at the next lustrum. This distinction,
however, great as it was, afforded
neither power nor advantages, and did not
even confer the privilege of presiding at the
meetings of the senate, which only belonged
to those magistrates who had the right of
convoking the senate.&mdash;During the republican
period no senatorial census existed,
although senators naturally always belonged
to the wealthiest classes. The institution of
a census for senators belongs to the time of
the empire. Augustus first fixed it at 400,000
sesterces, afterwards increased it to double
this sum, and at last even to 1,200,000 sesterces.
Those senators whose property did
not amount to this sum received grants from
the emperor to make it up. As regards the
age at which a person might become a senator,
we have no express statement for the
time of the republic, although it appears to
have been fixed by some custom or law, as
the aetas senatoria is frequently mentioned,
especially during the latter period of the
republic. But we may by induction discover
the probable age. We know that, according
to the lex annalis of the tribune Villius, the
age fixed for the quaestorship was 31. Now
as it might happen that a quaestor was made
a senator immediately after the expiration
of his office, we may presume that the
earliest age at which a man could become a
senator was 32. Augustus at last fixed the
senatorial age at 25, which appears to have
remained unaltered throughout the time of
the empire.&mdash;No senator was allowed to
carry on any mercantile business. About
the commencement of the second Punic war,
some senators appear to have violated this
law or custom, and in order to prevent its
recurrence a law was passed, with the vehement
opposition of the senate, that none of
its members should be permitted to possess a
ship of more than 300 amphorae in tonnage,
as this was thought sufficiently large to convey
to Rome the produce of their estates
abroad. It is clear, however, that this law
was frequently violated.&mdash;Regular meetings
of the senate (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus legitimus</i>) took place
during the republic, and probably during the
kingly period also, on the calends, nones,
and ides of every month: extraordinary
meetings (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus indictus</i>) might be convoked
on any other day, with the exception
of those which were atri, and those on which
comitia were held. The right of convoking
the senate during the kingly period belonged
to the king, or to his vicegerent, the custos
urbis. This right was during the republic
transferred to the curule magistrates, and at
last to the tribunes also. If a senator did
not appear on a day of meeting, he was
liable to a fine, for which a pledge was taken
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pignoris captio</i>) until it was paid. Towards
the end of the republic it was decreed, that
during the whole month of February the senate
should give audience to foreign ambassadors
on all days on which the senate could lawfully
meet, and that no other matters
should be discussed until these affairs were
settled.&mdash;The places where the meetings of the
senate were held (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senacula</i>) were
always inaugurated by the augurs. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Templum">Templum</a>.</span>]
The most ancient place was the
Curia Hostilia, in which alone originally a
senatus-consultum could be made. Afterwards,
however, several temples were used
for this purpose, such as the temple of Concordia,
a place near the temple of Bellona
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Legatus">Legatus</a></span>], and one near the porta Capena.
Under the emperors the senate also met in
other places: under Caesar, the Curia Julia,
a building of extraordinary splendour, was
commenced; but subsequently meetings of
the senate were frequently held in the house of
a consul.&mdash;The subjects laid before the senate
belonged partly to the internal affairs of the
state, partly to legislation, and partly to
finance; and no measure could be brought
before the populus without having previously
been discussed and prepared by the senate.
The senate was thus the medium through
which all affairs of the whole government
had to pass: it considered and discussed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
whatever measures the king thought proper
to introduce, and had, on the other hand, a
perfect control over the assembly of the populus,
which could only accept or reject what
the senate brought before it. When a king
died, the royal dignity, until a successor was
elected, was transferred to the Decem Primi,
each of whom in rotation held this dignity
for five days. Under the republic, the senate
had at first the right of proposing to the
comitia the candidates for magistracies, but
this right was subsequently lost: the comitia
centuriata became quite free in regard to
elections, and were no longer dependent upon
the proposal of the senate. The curies only
still possessed the right of sanctioning the
election; but in the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 299 they were
compelled to sanction any election of magistrates
which the comitia might make, before
it took place, and this soon after became law
by the Lex Maenia. When at last the curies
no longer assembled for this empty show of
power, the senate stepped into their place, and
henceforth in elections, and soon after also in
matters of legislation, the senate had previously
to sanction whatever the comitia
might decide. After the Lex Hortensia a
decree of the comitia tributa became law,
even without the sanction of the senate. The
original state of things had thus gradually
become reversed, and the senate had lost very
important branches of its power, which had
all been gained by the comitia tributa. In
its relation to the comitia centuriata, however,
the ancient rules were still in force, as
laws, declarations of war, conclusions of
peace, treaties, &amp;c., were brought before
them, and decided by them on the proposal
of the senate.&mdash;The powers of the senate,
after both orders were placed upon a perfect
equality, may be thus briefly summed
up. The senate continued to have the supreme
superintendence in all matters of religion;
it determined upon the manner in
which a war was to be conducted, what
legions were to be placed at the disposal of a
commander, and whether new ones were to
be levied; it decreed into what provinces the
consuls and praetors were to be sent [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Provincia">Provincia</a></span>],
and whose imperium was to be prolonged.
The commissioners who were generally
sent out to settle the administration of
a newly-conquered country, were always appointed
by the senate. All embassies for the
conclusion of peace or treaties with foreign
states were sent out by the senate, and such
ambassadors were generally senators themselves,
and ten in number. The senate alone
carried on the negotiations with foreign ambassadors,
and received the complaints of
subject or allied nations, who always regarded
the senate as their common protector.
By virtue of this office of protector it also
settled all disputes which might arise among
the municipia and colonies of Italy, and
punished all heavy crimes committed in
Italy, which might endanger the public peace
and security. Even in Rome itself, the judices
to whom the praetor referred important
cases, both public and private, were taken
from among the senators, and in extraordinary
cases the senate appointed especial commissions
to investigate them; but such a
commission, if the case in question was a
capital offence committed by a citizen, required
the sanction of the people. When
the republic was in danger, the senate might
confer unlimited power upon the magistrates
by the formula, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Videant consules, ne quid
respublica detrimenti capiat</i>, which was
equivalent to a declaration of martial law
within the city. This general care for the
internal and external welfare of the republic
included, as before, the right of disposing of
the finances requisite for these purposes.
Hence all the revenue and expenditure of the
republic were under the direct administration
of the senate, and the censors and quaestors
were only its ministers or agents. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Censor">Censor</a></span>;
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Quaestor">Quaestor</a></span>.] All the expenses necessary for
the maintenance of the armies required the
sanction of the senate, before anything could
be done, and it might even prevent the triumph
of a returning general, by refusing to
assign the money necessary for it. There
are, however, instances of a general triumphing
without the consent of the senate.&mdash;How
many members were required to be present
in order to constitute a legal assembly, is
uncertain, though it appears that there existed
some regulations on this point, and
there is one instance on record, in which at
least one hundred senators were required to
be present. The presiding magistrate opened
the business with the words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod bonum,
faustum, felix fortunatumque sit populo Romano
Quiritibus</i>, and then laid before the
assembly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">referre</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">relatio</i>) what he had to
propose. Towards the end of the republic
the order in which the question was put to
the senators appears to have depended upon
the discretion of the presiding consul, who
called upon each member by pronouncing his
name; but he usually began with the princeps
senatus, or if consules designati were
present, with them. The consul generally
observed all the year round the same order in
which he had commenced on the first of
January. A senator when called upon to
speak might do so at full length, and even
introduce subjects not directly connected with
the point at issue. It depended upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
president which of the opinions expressed he
would put to the vote, and which he would
pass over. The majority of votes always
decided a question. The majority was ascertained
either by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">numeratio</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discessio</i>; that
is, the president either counted the votes, or
the members who voted on the same side
separated from those who voted otherwise.
The latter mode seems to have been the
usual one. What the senate determined was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatus consultum</i>, because the consul,
who introduced the business, was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatum
consulere</i>. In the enacting part of a lex
the populus were said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jubere</i>, and in a plebiscitum
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scire</i>; in a senatusconsultum the senate
was said <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">censere</i>. Certain forms were observed
in drawing up a senatusconsultum, of
which there is an example in Cicero: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. C.
Auctoritates Pridie Kal. Octob. in Aede
Apollinis, scribendo adfuerunt L. Domitius
Cn. Filius Ahenobarbus, &amp;c. Quod M. Marcellus
Consul V. F. (<em>verba fecit</em>) de prov.
Cons. D. E. R. I. C. (<em>de ea re ita censuerunt
Uti, &amp;c.</em>)</span>” The names of the persons who
were witnesses to the drawing up of the
senatusconsultum were called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctoritates</i>,
and these auctoritates were cited as evidence
of the fact of the persons named in them
having been present at the drawing up of the
S.C. There can be no doubt that certain
persons were required to be present <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scribendo</i>,
but others might assist if they chose, and a
person in this way might testify his regard
for another on behalf of whom or with reference
to whom the S. C. was made. Besides
the phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scribendo adesse</i>, there are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">esse ad
scribendum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">poni ad scribendum</i>. When
a S. C. was made on the motion of a person,
it was said to be made <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in sententiam ejus</i>.
If the S. C. was carried, it was written on
tablets, and placed in the Aerarium. Senatusconsulta
were, properly speaking, laws,
for it is clear that the senate had legislative
power even in the republican period; but it
is difficult to determine how far their legislative
power extended. A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decretum</i> of the
senate was a rule made by the senate as to
some matter which was strictly within its
competence, and thus differed from a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">senatusconsultum</i>,
which was a law; but these words
are often used indiscriminately and with
little precision. Many of the senatusconsulta
of the republican period were only determinations
of the senate, which became leges by
being carried in the comitia. One instance
of this kind occurred on the occasion of the
trial of Clodius for violating the mysteries of
the Bona Dea. A rogatio on the subject of
the trial was proposed to the comitia ex
senatusconsulto, which is also spoken of as
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctoritas</i> of the senate. A senate was
not allowed to be held before sunrise or to be
prolonged after sunset: on extraordinary
emergencies, however, this regulation was set
aside.&mdash;During the latter part of the republic
the senate was degraded in various ways by
Sulla, Caesar, and others, and on many occasions
it was only an instrument in the hands
of the men in power. In this way it became
prepared for the despotic government of the
emperors, when it was altogether the creature
and obedient instrument of the princeps.
The emperor himself was generally also
princeps senatus, and had the power of convoking
both ordinary and extraordinary
meetings, although the consuls, praetors and
tribunes continued to have the same right. The
ordinary meetings, according to a regulation
of Augustus, were held twice in every
month. In the reign of Tiberius the election
of magistrates was transferred from the people
to the senate, which, however, was enjoined
to take especial notice of those candidates
who were recommended to it by the
emperor. At the demise of an emperor the
senate had the right of appointing his successor,
in case no one had been nominated by
the emperor himself; but the senate very
rarely had an opportunity of exercising this
right, as it was usurped by the soldiers. The
aerarium at first still continued nominally to
be under the control of the senate, but the
emperors gradually took it under their own
exclusive management, and the senate retained
nothing but the administration of the
funds of the city (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arca publica</i>), which were
distinct both from the aerarium and from
the fiscus. Augustus ordained that no accusations
should any longer be brought before
the comitia, and instead of them he raised
the senate to a high court of justice, upon
which he conferred the right of taking cognisance
of capital offences committed by senators,
of crimes against the state and the person
of the emperors, and of crimes committed
by the provincial magistrates in the administration
of their provinces. Respecting the
provinces of the senate, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Provincia">Provincia</a></span>.
Under the empire, senatusconsulta began to
take the place of leges, properly so called,
and as the senate was, with the exception of
the emperor, the only legislating body, such
senatusconsulta are frequently designated by
the name of the consuls in whose year of
office they were passed.&mdash;The distinctions and
privileges enjoyed by senators were: 1. The
tunica with a broad purple stripe (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">latus
clavus</i>) in front, which was woven in it, and
not, as is commonly believed, sewed upon it.
2. A kind of short boot, with the letter C. on
the front of the foot. This C. is generally
supposed to mean <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centum</i>, and to refer to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
original number of 100 (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centum</i>) senators.
3. The right of sitting in the orchestra in the
theatres and amphitheatres. This distinction
was first procured for the senators by Scipio
Africanus Major, 194 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 4. On a certain
day in the year a sacrifice was offered to
Jupiter in the Capitol, and on this occasion
the senators alone had a feast in the Capitol;
the right was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus publice epulandi</i>.
5. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus liberae legationis</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Legatus">Legatus</a></span>, <a href="#Page_224">p. 224</a>.]</p>

island it appears that the Roman ladies obtained
their most splendid garments [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Coa">Coa
Vestis</a></span>], which were remarkably thin, sometimes
of a fine purple dye, and variegated
with transverse stripes of gold. Silk was
supposed to come from the country of the Seres
in Asia, whence a silk garment is usually
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Serica vestis</i>. Under the empire the
rage for such garments was constantly on the
increase. Even men aspired to be adorned
with silk, and hence the senate, early in the
reign of Tiberius, enacted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ne vestis Serica viros
fœdaret</i>. The eggs of the silkworm were first
brought into Europe in the age of Justinian,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 530, in the hollow stem of a plant from
“Serinda,” which was probably Khotan in
Little Bucharia, by some monks who had learnt
the method of hatching and rearing them.</p>

<p id="Servus">SERVUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοῦλος</span>), a slave. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>
Slavery existed almost throughout the whole
of Greece; and Aristotle says that a complete
household is that which consists of slaves
and freemen, and he defines a slave to be a
living working-tool and possession. None
of the Greek philosophers ever seem to have
objected to slavery as a thing morally wrong;
Plato in his perfect state only desires that no
Greeks should be made slaves by Greeks, and
Aristotle defends the justice of the institution
on the ground of a diversity of race, and
divides mankind into the free and those who
are slaves by nature; under the latter description
he appears to have regarded all
barbarians in the Greek sense of the word,
and therefore considers their slavery justifiable.
In the most ancient times there are
said to have been no slaves in Greece, but we
find them in the Homeric poems, though by
no means so generally as in later times.
They are usually prisoners taken in war,
who serve their conquerors: but we also
read as well of the purchase and sale of
slaves. They were, however, at that time
mostly confined to the houses of the wealthy.
There were two kinds of slavery among the
Greeks. One species arose when the inhabitants
of a country were subdued by an invading
tribe, and reduced to the condition of
serfs or bondsmen. They lived upon and
cultivated the land which their masters had
appropriated to themselves, and paid them a
certain rent. They also attended their
masters in war. They could not be sold out
of the country or separated from their families,
and could acquire property. Such were
the Helots of Sparta [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Helotes">Helotes</a></span>], and the
Penestae of Thessaly [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Penestae">Penestae</a></span>]. The other
species of slavery consisted of domestic slaves
acquired by purchase, who were entirely the
property of their masters, and could be disposed
of like any other goods and chattels:
these were the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δοῦλοι</span> properly so called, and
were the kind of slaves that existed at Athens
and Corinth. In commercial cities slaves
were very numerous, as they performed the
work of the artisans and manufacturers of
modern towns. In poorer republics, which
had little or no capital, and which subsisted
wholly by agriculture, they would be few:
thus in Phocis and Locris there are said to
have been originally no domestic slaves.
The majority of slaves was purchased; few
comparatively were born in the family of the
master, partly because the number of female
slaves was very small in comparison with the
male, and partly because the cohabitation of
slaves was discouraged, as it was considered
cheaper to purchase than to rear slaves. It
was a recognised rule of Greek national law
that the persons of those who were taken
prisoners in war became the property of the
conqueror, but it was the practice for Greeks
to give liberty to those of their own nation
on payment of a ransom. Consequently
almost all slaves in Greece, with the exception
of the serfs above-mentioned, were barbarians.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
The chief supply seems to have
come from the Greek colonies in Asia Minor,
which had abundant opportunities of obtaining
them from their own neighbourhood and
the interior of Asia. A considerable number
of slaves also came from Thrace, where
the parents frequently sold their children.&mdash;At
Athens, as well as in other states, there
was a regular slave-market, called the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύκλος</span>, because the slaves stood round in
a circle. They were also sometimes sold by
auction, and were then placed on a stone,
as is now done when slaves are sold in the
United States of North America: the same
was also the practice in Rome, whence the
phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo de lapide emtus</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Auctio">Auctio</a>.</span>] At
Athens the number of slaves was far greater
than the free population. Even the poorest
citizen had a slave for the care of his household,
and in every moderate establishment
many were employed for all possible occupations,
as bakers, cooks, tailors, &amp;c.&mdash;Slaves
either worked on their masters’ account or
their own (in the latter case they paid their
masters a certain sum a day); or they were
let out by their master on hire, either for the
mines or any other kind of labour, or as hired
servants for wages. The rowers on board
the ships were usually slaves, who either
belonged to the state or to private persons,
who let them out to the state on payment of
a certain sum. It appears that a considerable
number of persons kept large gangs of
slaves merely for the purpose of letting out,
and found this a profitable mode of investing
their capital. Great numbers were required
for the mines, and in most cases the mine-lessees
would be obliged to hire some, as they
would not have sufficient capital to purchase
as many as they wanted. The rights of possession
with regard to slaves differed in no
respect from any other property; they could
be given or taken as pledges. The condition,
however, of Greek slaves was upon the whole
better than that of Roman ones, with the
exception perhaps of Sparta, where, according
to Plutarch, it is the best place in the
world to be a freeman, and the worst to be a
slave. At Athens especially the slaves seem
to have been allowed a degree of liberty and
indulgence which was never granted to them
at Rome. The life and person of a slave at
Athens were also protected by the law: a
person who struck or maltreated a slave was
liable to an action; a slave too could not be
put to death without legal sentence. He
could even take shelter from the cruelty of
his master in the temple of Theseus, and
there claim the privilege of being sold by
him. The person of a slave was, of course,
not considered so sacred as that of a freeman:
his offences were punished with corporal
chastisement, which was the last mode
of punishment inflicted on a freeman; he
was not believed upon his oath, but his evidence
in courts of justice was always taken
with torture. Notwithstanding the generally
mild treatment of slaves in Greece, their
insurrection was not unfrequent: but these
insurrections in Attica were usually confined
to the mining slaves, who were treated with
more severity than the others. Slaves were
sometimes manumitted at Athens, though not
so frequently as at Rome. Those who were
manumitted (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπελεύθεροι</span>) did not become
citizens, as they might at Rome, but passed
into the condition of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metoici</i>. They were
obliged to honour their former master
as their patron (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστάτης</span>), and to fulfil
certain duties towards him, the neglect of
which rendered them liable to the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη ἀποστασίου</span>,
by which they might again be sold into
slavery. Respecting the public slaves at
Athens, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Demosii">Demosii</a></span>. It appears that there
was a tax upon slaves at Athens, which was
probably three oboli a year for each slave.&mdash;(2)
<span id="Serv_r" class="smcap">Roman.</span> The Romans viewed liberty as
the natural state, and slavery as a condition
which was contrary to the natural state. The
mutual relation of slave and master among the
Romans was expressed by the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Servus</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus</i>; and the power and interest which
the dominus had over and in the slave was expressed
by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominium</i>. Slaves existed at Rome
in the earliest times of which we have any
record; but they do not appear to have been
numerous under the kings and in the earliest
ages of the republic. The different trades
and the mechanical arts were chiefly carried
on by the clients of the patricians, and the
small farms in the country were cultivated
for the most part by the labours of the
proprietor and of his own family. But as
the territories of the Roman state were extended,
the patricians obtained possession
of large estates out of the ager publicus,
since it was the practice of the Romans to
deprive a conquered people of part of their
land. These estates probably required a
larger number of hands for their cultivation
than could readily be obtained among the
free population, and since the freemen were
constantly liable to be called away from their
work to serve in the armies, the lands began
to be cultivated almost entirely by slave
labour. Through war and commerce slaves
could easily be obtained, and at a cheap rate,
and their number soon became so great, that
the poorer class of freemen was thrown
almost entirely out of employment. This
state of things was one of the chief arguments
used by Licinius and the Gracchi for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
limiting the quantity of public land which a
person might possess. In Sicily, which supplied
Rome with so great a quantity of corn,
the number of agricultural slaves was immense:
the oppressions to which they were
exposed drove them twice to open rebellion,
and their numbers enabled them to defy for
a time the Roman power. The first of these
servile wars began in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 134 and ended in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 132, and the second commenced in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
102 and lasted almost four years. Long,
however, after it had become the custom to
employ large gangs of slaves in the cultivation
of the land, the number of those who
served as personal attendants still continued
to be small. Persons in good circumstances
seem usually to have had one only to wait
upon them, who was generally called by the
name of his master with the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">por</i> (that
is, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puer</i>) affixed to it, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caipor</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lucipor</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Marcipor</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Publipor</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quintipor</i>, &amp;c. But
during the latter times of the republic and
under the empire the number of domestic
slaves greatly increased, and in every family
of importance there were separate slaves to
attend to all the necessities of domestic life.
It was considered a reproach to a man not to
keep a considerable number of slaves. The
first question asked respecting a person’s
fortune was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quot pascit servos</i>, “How many
slaves does he keep?” Ten slaves seem to
have been the lowest number which a person
could keep in the age of Augustus, with a
proper regard to respectability in society.
The immense number of prisoners taken in
the constant wars of the republic, and the
increase of wealth and luxury, augmented
the number of slaves to a prodigious extent.
A freedman under Augustus, who had lost
much property in the civil wars, left at his
death as many as 4,116. Two hundred was
no uncommon number for one person to keep.
The mechanical arts, which were formerly
in the hands of the clients, were now entirely
exercised by slaves: a natural growth of
things, for where slaves perform certain
duties or practise certain arts, such duties or
arts are thought degrading to a freeman.
It must not be forgotten, that the games of
the amphitheatre required an immense number
of slaves trained for the purpose. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Gladiatores">Gladiatores</a>.</span>]
Like the slaves in Sicily, the
gladiators in Italy rose in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 73 against
their oppressors, and under the able generalship
of Spartacus, defeated a Roman consular
army, and were not subdued till B.C.
71, when 60,000 of them are said to have
fallen in battle.&mdash;A slave could not contract
a marriage. His cohabitation with a woman
was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">contubernium</i>; and no legal relation
between him and his children was recognized.
A slave could have no property. He was
not incapable of acquiring property, but his
acquisitions belonged to his master. Slaves
were not only employed in the usual domestic
offices and in the labours of the field,
but also as factors or agents for their masters
in the management of business, and as mechanics,
artisans, and in every branch of
industry. It may easily be conceived that,
under these circumstances, especially as they
were often entrusted with property to a large
amount, there must have arisen a practice of
allowing the slave to consider part of his
gains as his own; this was his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peculium</i>, a
term also applicable to such acquisitions of a
filius-familias as his father allowed him to
consider as his own. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Patria">Patria Potestas</a>.</span>]
According to strict law, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peculium</i> was
the property of the master, but according to
usage, it was considered to be the property
of the slave. Sometimes it was agreed between
master and slave, that the slave
should purchase his freedom with his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peculium</i>
when it amounted to a certain sum. A
runaway slave (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fugitivus</i>) could not lawfully
be received or harboured. The master was
entitled to pursue him wherever he pleased;
and it was the duty of all authorities to give
him aid in recovering the slave. It was the
object of various laws to check the running
away of slaves in every way, and accordingly
a runaway slave could not legally be
an object of sale. A class of persons called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fugitivarii</i> made it their business to recover
runaway slaves. A person was a slave either
jure gentium or jure civili. Under the republic,
the chief supply of slaves arose from
prisoners taken in war, who were sold by
the quaestors with a crown on their heads
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub corona venire, vendere</i>), and usually on
the spot where they were taken, as the care
of a large number of captives was inconvenient.
Consequently slave-dealers usually
accompanied an army, and frequently after a
great battle had been gained many thousands
were sold at once, when the slave-dealers
obtained them for a mere nothing. The
slave trade was also carried on to a great
extent, and after the fall of Corinth and
Carthage, Delos was the chief mart for this
traffic. When the Cilician pirates had possession
of the Mediterranean, as many as
10,000 slaves are said to have been imported
and sold there in one day. A large number
came from Thrace and the countries in the
north of Europe, but the chief supply was
from Africa, and more especially Asia,
whence we frequently read of Phrygians,
Lycians, Cappadocians, &amp;c. as slaves. The
trade of slave-dealers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mangones</i>) was considered
disreputable; but it was very lucrative,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
and great fortunes were frequently
realised from it. Slaves were usually sold
by auction at Rome. They were placed
either on a raised stone (hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de lapide
emtus</i>), or a raised platform (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">catasta</i>), so that
every one might see and handle them, even
if they did not wish to purchase them. Purchasers
usually took care to have them
stripped naked, for slave-dealers had recourse
to as many tricks to conceal personal defects
as the horse-jockeys of modern times: sometimes
purchasers called in the advice of medical
men. Newly imported slaves had their
feet whitened with chalk, and those that
came from the East had their ears bored,
which we know was a sign of slavery among
many eastern nations. The slave-market,
like all other markets, was under the jurisdiction
of the aediles, who made many regulations
by edicts respecting the sale of slaves.
The character of the slave was set forth in
a scroll (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">titulus</i>) hanging around his neck,
which was a warranty to the purchaser: the
vendor was bound to announce fairly all his
defects, and if he gave a false account had to
take him back within six months from the
time of his sale, or make up to the purchaser
what the latter had lost through obtaining
an inferior kind of slave to what had been
warranted. The chief points which the
vendor had to warrant, were the health of the
slave, especially freedom from epilepsy, and
that he had not a tendency to thievery, running
away, or committing suicide. Slaves
sold without any warranty wore at the time
of sale a cap (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pileus</i>) upon their head.
Slaves newly imported were generally preferred
for common work: those who had
served long were considered artful (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veteratores</i>);
and the pertness and impudence of
those born in their master’s house, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vernae</i>, were proverbial. The value of slaves
depended of course upon their qualifications;
but under the empire the increase of luxury
and the corruption of morals led purchasers
to pay immense sums for beautiful slaves,
or such as ministered to the caprice or whim
of the purchaser. Eunuchs always fetched
a very high price, and Martial speaks of
beautiful boys who sold for as much as
100,000 or 200,000 sesterces each (885<em>l.</em> 8<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em>
and 1770<em>l.</em> 16<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>). Slaves who possessed
a knowledge of any art which might bring
profit to their owners, also sold for a large
sum. Thus literary men and doctors frequently
fetched a high price, and also slaves
fitted for the stage.&mdash;Slaves were divided into
many various classes: the first division was
into public or private. The former belonged
to the state and public bodies, and their condition
was preferable to that of the common
slaves. They were less liable to be sold, and
under less control, than ordinary slaves:
they also possessed the privilege of the testamenti
factio to the amount of one half of
their property, which shows that they were
regarded in a different light from other slaves.
Public slaves were employed to take care of
the public buildings, and to attend upon magistrates
and priests. A body of slaves belonging
to one person was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia</i>, but
two were not considered sufficient to constitute
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia</i>. Private slaves were divided
into urban (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia urbana</i>) and rustic
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">familia rustica</i>); but the name of urban
was given to those slaves who served in the
villa or country residence as well as in the
town house; so that the words urban and
rustic rather characterised the nature of their
occupations than the place where they served.
Slaves were also arranged in certain classes,
which held a higher or a lower rank according
to the nature of their occupation. These
classes are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordinarii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vulgares</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mediastini</i>.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ordinarii</i>
seem to have been those slaves
who had the superintendence of certain parts of
the housekeeping. They were always chosen
from those who had the confidence of their
master, and they generally had certain slaves
under them. To this class the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actores</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">procuratores</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dispensatores</i> belong, who
occur in the familia rustica as well as the
familia urbana, but in the former are almost
the same as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villici</i>. They were stewards
or bailiffs. To the same class also belong the
slaves who had the charge of the different
stores, and who correspond to our house-keepers
and butlers: they are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cellarii</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">condi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">procuratores peni</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vulgares</i>
included the great body of slaves in a house
who had to attend to any particular duty in
the house, and to minister to the domestic
wants of their master. As there were distinct
slaves or a distinct slave for almost
every department of household economy, as
bakers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pistores</i>), cooks (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coqui</i>), confectioners
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dulciarii</i>), picklers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salmentarii</i>), &amp;c., it is
unnecessary to mention these more particularly.
This class also included the porters
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostiarii</i>), the bed-chamber slaves (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubicularii</i>),
the litter-bearers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lecticarii</i>), and all
personal attendants of any kind.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mediastini</i>,
the name given to slaves used for any
common purpose, was chiefly applied to certain
slaves belonging to the familia rustica.&mdash;The
treatment of slaves of course varied
greatly, according to the disposition of their
masters, but they were upon the whole, as
has been already remarked, treated with
greater severity and cruelty than among the
Athenians. Originally the master could use
the slave as he pleased; under the republic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
the law does not seem to have protected the
person or life of the slave at all; but the
cruelty of masters was to some extent restrained
under the empire by various enactments.
In early times, when the number of
slaves was small, they were treated with
more indulgence, and more like members of
the family: they joined their masters in
offering up prayers and thanksgivings to the
gods, and partook of their meals in common
with their masters, though not at the same
table with them, but upon benches (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subsellia</i>)
placed at the foot of the lectus. But with
the increase of numbers and of luxury among
masters, the ancient simplicity of manners
was changed: a certain quantity of food was
allowed them (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dimensum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demensum</i>), which
was granted to them either monthly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">menstruum</i>)
or daily (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diarium</i>). Their chief food
was the corn called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">far</i>, of which either four
or five modii were granted them a month, or
one Roman pound (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libra</i>) a day. They also
obtained an allowance of salt and oil: Cato
allowed his slaves a sextarius of oil a month
and a modius of salt a year. They also got
a small quantity of wine, with an additional
allowance on the Saturnalia and Compitalia,
and sometimes fruit, but seldom vegetables.
Butcher’s meat seems to have been hardly
ever given them. Under the republic they
were not allowed to serve in the army,
though after the battle of Cannae, when the
state was in imminent danger, 8000 slaves
were purchased by the state for the army,
and subsequently manumitted on account of
their bravery. The offences of slaves were
punished with severity, and frequently with
the utmost barbarity. One of the mildest
punishments was the removal from the
familia urbana to the rustica, where they
were obliged to work in chains or fetters.
They were frequently beaten with sticks or
scourged with the whip. Runaway slaves
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fugitivi</i>) and thieves (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fures</i>) were branded
on the forehead with a mark (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stigma</i>), whence
they are said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">notati</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inscripti</i>. Slaves
were also punished by being hung up by their
hands with weights suspended to their feet,
or by being sent to work in the Ergastulum
or Pistrinum. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ergastulum">Ergastulum</a>.</span>] The carrying
of the furca was a very common mode of
punishment. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Furca">Furca</a>.</span>] The toilet of the
Roman ladies was a dreadful ordeal to the
female slaves, who were often barbarously
punished by their mistresses for the slightest
mistake in the arrangement of the hair or a
part of the dress. Masters might work their
slaves as many hours in the day as they
pleased, but they usually allowed them holidays
on the public festivals. At the festival
of Saturnus, in particular, special indulgences
were granted to all slaves, of which an account
is given under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Saturnalia">Saturnalia</a></span>. There
was no distinctive dress for slaves. It was
once proposed in the senate to give slaves a
distinctive costume, but it was rejected, since
it was considered dangerous to show them
their number. Male slaves were not allowed
to wear the toga or bulla, nor females the
stola, but otherwise they were dressed nearly
in the same way as poor people, in clothes of
a dark colour (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pullati</i>) and slippers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crepidae</i>).
The rights of burial, however, were
not denied to slaves, for, as the Romans regarded
slavery as an institution of society,
death was considered to put an end to the distinction
between slaves and freemen. Slaves
were sometimes even buried with their masters,
and we find funeral inscriptions addressed to
the Dii Manes of slaves (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dis Manibus</i>).</p>


<p id="Sescunx">SESCUNX. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As_c">As</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Sestertius">SESTERTĬUS, a Roman coin, which properly
belonged to the silver coinage, in which
it was one-fourth of the denarius, and therefore
equal to 2½ asses. Hence the name,
which is an abbreviation of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">semis tertius</i>
(sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummus</i>), the Roman mode of expressing
2½. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummus</i> is often expressed
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertius</i>, and often it stands alone,
meaning <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertius</i>. Hence the symbol HS
or IIS, which is used to designate the sestertius.
It stands either for LLS (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libra
Libra et Semis</i>), or for IIS, the two I’s
merely forming the numeral two (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">asses</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">librae</i>), and the whole being in either case
equivalent to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dupondius et semis</i>. When the
as was reduced to half an ounce, and the
number of asses in the denarius was made
sixteen instead of ten [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As_c">As</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Denarius">Denarius</a></span>], the
sestertius was still ¼ of the denarius, and
therefore contained no longer 2½, but 4 asses.
The old reckoning of 10 asses to the denarius
was kept, however, in paying the troops.
After this change the sestertius was coined
in brass as well as in silver; the metal used
for it was that called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurichalcum</i>, which
was much finer than the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes</i>, of
which the asses were made. The sum of
1000 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertii</i> was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertium</i>. This
was also denoted by the symbol HS, the
obvious explanation of which is “IIS (2½
millia).” The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertium</i> was always a sum of
money, never a <em>coin</em>; the <em>coin</em> used in the payment
of large sums was the denarius. According
to the value we have assigned to the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Denarius">Denarius</a></span>,

<p class="noindent">The sestertius was the denomination of money

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mille sestertii</i> = M <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertium</i> (for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertiorum</i>)
= M <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummi</i> = M <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummum</i> (for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummorum</i>)
= M <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertii nummi</i> = M <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertium
nummum</i> = <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertium</i>. These forms are used
with the numeral adjectives below 1000:
sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">millia</i> is used instead of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertia</i>:
sometimes both words are omitted: sometimes
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertium</i> is added. For
example, 600,000 sestertii = <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sescenta sestertia</i>
= <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sescenta millia</i> = <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sescenta</i> = <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sescenta sestertia
nummum</i>. For sums of a thousand
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertia</i> (<em>i.e.</em> a million <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertii</i>) and upwards,
the numeral adverbs in <em>ies</em> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decies, undecies,
vicies, &amp;c.</i>) are used, with which the words
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centena millia</i> (a hundred thousand) must be
understood. With these adverbs the neuter
singular <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertium</i> is joined in the case required
by the construction. Thus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decies
sestertium</i> = <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decies centena millia sestertium</i>
= <em>ten times a hundred thousand sestertii</em> =
1,000,000 sestertii = 1000 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertia</i>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">millies</i>
HS = <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">millies centena millia sestertium</i> = a
thousand times one hundred thousand sestertii
= 100,000,000 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertii</i> = 100,000 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertia</i>.
When the numbers are written in cypher, it
is often difficult to know whether <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertii</i> or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertia</i> are meant. A distinction is sometimes
made by a line placed over the numeral
when <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sestertia</i> are intended, or in other
words, when the numeral is an adverb in <em>ies</em>.

<p id="Sibyllini">SĬBYLLĪNI LIBRI. These books are said
to have been obtained in the reign of Tarquinius
Priscus, or according to other accounts
in that of Tarquinius Superbus, when a
Sibyl (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σίβυλλα</span>), or prophetic woman, presented
herself before the king, and offered nine
books for sale. Upon the king refusing to
purchase them, she went and burnt three,
and then returned and demanded the same
price for the remaining six as she had done
for the nine. The king again refused to
purchase them, whereupon she burnt three
more, and demanded the same sum for the
remaining three as she had done at first for
the nine; the king’s curiosity now became
excited, so that he purchased the books, and
then the Sibyl vanished. These books were
probably written in Greek, as the later ones
undoubtedly were. They were kept in a
stone chest under ground in the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus, under the custody of
certain officers, at first only two in number,
but afterwards increased successively to ten
and fifteen, of whom an account is given
under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Decemviri">Decemviri</a></span>. The public were not
allowed to inspect the books, and they were
only consulted by the officers, who had the
charge of them, at the special command of
the senate. They were not consulted, as the
Greek oracles were, for the purpose of getting
light concerning future events; but to learn
what worship was required by the gods, when
they had manifested their wrath by national
calamities or prodigies. Accordingly we find
that the instruction they give is in the same
spirit; prescribing what honour was to be
paid to the deities already recognised, or
what new ones were to be imported from
abroad. When the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus
was burnt in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 82, the Sibylline
books perished in the fire; and in order to
restore them, ambassadors were sent to various
towns in Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor, to
make fresh collections, which on the rebuilding
of the temple were deposited in the same
place that the former had occupied. The
Sibylline books were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fata Sibyllina</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libri Fatales</i>. Along with the
Sibylline books were preserved, under the
guard of the same officers, the books of the
two prophetic brothers, the Marcii, the Etruscan
prophecies of the nymph Bygoe, and
those of Albuna or Albunea of Tibur. Those
of the Marcii, which had not been placed
there at the time of the battle of Cannae,
were written in Latin.</p>


<p id="Sica">SĪCA, <em>dim.</em> SĪCĪLA, whence the English
<em>sickle</em>, a curved dagger, adapted by its form
to be concealed under the clothes, and therefore
carried by robbers and murderers. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sica</i>
may be translated <em>a scimitar</em>, to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
it from <span class="smcap"><a href="#Pugio">Pugio</a></span>, which denoted a dagger of the
common kind. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sicarius</i>, though properly
meaning one who murdered with the sica,
was applied to murderers in general. Hence
the forms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de sicariis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter sicarios</i> were
used in the criminal courts in reference to
murder. Thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">judicium inter sicarios</i>, “a

“to defend against a charge of murder.”</p>

<p id="Signa">SIGNA MĪLĬTĀRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σημεῖα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σημαίαι</span>),
military ensigns or standards. The most
ancient standard employed by the Romans is
said to have been a handful of straw fixed to
the top of a spear or pole. Hence the company
of soldiers belonging to it was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Manipulus</i>. The bundle of hay or fern was
soon succeeded by the figures of animals, viz.
the eagle, the wolf, the minotaur, the horse,
and the boar. These appear to have corresponded
to the five divisions of the Roman
army as shown on <a href="#ill165">p. 165</a>. The eagle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquila</i>)
was carried by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquilifer</i> in the midst of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hastati</i>, and we may suppose the wolf to
have been carried among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">principes</i>, and
so on. In the second consulship of Marius,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 104, the four quadrupeds were entirely
laid aside as standards, the eagle being alone
retained. It was made of silver, or bronze,
and with expanded wings, but was probably
of a small size, since a standard-bearer (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signifer</i>)
under Julius Caesar is said in circumstances
of danger to have wrenched the eagle
from its staff, and concealed it in the folds of
his girdle. Under the later emperors the
eagle was carried, as it had been for many
centuries, with the legion, a legion being on
that account sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquila</i>, and at
the same time each cohort had for its own
ensign the serpent or dragon (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">draco</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δράκων</span>),
which was woven on a square piece of cloth,
elevated on a gilt staff, to which a cross-bar
was adapted for the purpose, and carried by
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">draconarius</i>. Another figure used in the
standards was a ball (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pila</i>), supposed to have
been emblematic of the dominion of Rome
over the world; and for the same reason
a bronze figure of Victory was sometimes
fixed at the top of the staff. Under the
eagle or other emblem was often placed a
head of the reigning emperor, which was
to the army the object of idolatrous adoration.
The minor divisions of a cohort,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centuries</i>, had also each an ensign,
inscribed with the number both of the cohort
and of the century. By this provision every
soldier was enabled with the greatest ease to
take his place. The standard of the cavalry,
properly called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillum</i>, was a square piece
of cloth expanded upon a cross in the manner
already indicated, and perhaps surmounted
by some figure. The following cut, containing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
several standards, represents the performance
of the sacrifice called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suovetaurilia</i>.
The imperial standard from the time of Constantine
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">labarum</i>; on it a figure
or emblem of Christ was woven in gold upon
purple cloth, and this was substituted for the
head of the emperor. Since the movements
of a body of troops and of every portion of it
were regulated by the standards, all the evolutions,
acts, and incidents of the Roman
army were expressed by phrases derived from
this circumstance. Thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signa inferre</i> meant
to advance, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">referre</i> to retreat, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">convertere</i>
to face about; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">efferre</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castris vellere</i>, to
march out of the camp; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad signa convenire</i>,
to re-assemble. Notwithstanding some obscurity
in the use of terms, it appears that,
whilst the standard of the legion was properly
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquila</i>, those of the cohorts were in a
special sense of the term called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signa</i>, their
bearers being <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signiferi</i>, and that those of the
manipuli or smaller divisions of the cohort
were denominated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexilla</i>, their bearers being
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexillarii</i>. In time of peace the standards
were kept in the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Aerarium">Aerarium</a></span>, under the care
of the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Quaestor">Quaestor</a></span>.</p>

<p id="Siparium">SĪPĂRĬUM, a piece of tapestry stretched

theatre, and consequently answered the purpose
of the drop-scene with us, although,
contrary to our practice, it was depressed
when the play began, so as to go below the
level of the stage (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aulaea premuntur</i>), and
was raised again when the performance was
concluded (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tolluntur</i>). It appears that human
figures were represented upon it, whose feet
seemed to rest upon the stage when this
screen was drawn up. These figures were
sometimes those of Britons woven in the
canvass, and raising their arms in the attitude
of lifting up a purple curtain, so as to
be introduced in the same manner as Atlantes,
Persae, and Caryatides. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Caryatides">Caryatides</a>.</span>] In

<p id="Sistrum">SISTRUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σεῖστρον</span>), a mystical instrument

hand (see cut), and shaken, from which circumstance
it derived its name. The introduction
of the worship of Isis into Italy
shortly before the commencement of the
Christian aera made the Romans familiar
with this instrument.</p>

<p id="Sitophylaces">SĪTŎPHỸLĂCES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτοφύλακες</span>), a board of
officers, chosen by lot, at Athens. They were
at first three, afterwards increased to fifteen,
of whom ten were for the city, five for the
Peiraeus. Their business was partly to watch
the arrival of the corn ships, take account of
the quantity imported, and see that the import
laws were duly observed; partly to
watch the sales of corn in the market, and
take care that the prices were fair and reasonable,
and none but legal weights and measures
used by the factors; in which respect
their duties were much the same as those of
the Agoranomi and Metronomi with regard to
other saleable articles.</p>


<p id="Sitos">SĪTOS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σῖτος</span>), corn. The soil of Attica,
though favourable to the production of figs,
olives, and grapes, was not so favourable for
corn; and accordingly a large quantity of
corn was annually imported. Exportation
was entirely prohibited, nor was any Athenian
or resident alien allowed to carry corn
to any other place than Athens. Whoever
did so, was punishable with death. Of the
corn brought into the Athenian port two-thirds
was to be brought into the city and
sold there. No one might lend money on a
ship that did not sail with an express condition
to bring a return cargo, part of it corn,
to Athens. Strict regulations were made with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
respect to the sale of corn in the market.
Conspiracies among the corn-dealers (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτοπῶλαι</span>)
to buy up the corn (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνωνεῖσθαι</span>), or
raise the price (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνιστάναι τὰς τιμὰς</span>), were
punished with death. The sale of corn was
placed under the supervision of a special
board of officers called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitophylaces</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτοφύλακες</span>),
while that of all other marketable
commodities was superintended by the agoranomi.
It was their business to see that meal
and bread were of the proper quality, and
sold at the legal weight and price. Notwithstanding
these careful provisions, scarcities
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτοδεῖαι</span>) frequently occurred at Athens.
The state then made great efforts to supply
the wants of the people by importing large
quantities of corn, and selling it at a low
price. Public granaries were kept in the
Odeum, Pompeum, Long Porch, and naval
storehouse near the sea. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitonae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιτῶναι</span>)
were appointed to get in the supply and
manage the sale. Persons called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apodectae</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποδέκται</span>) received the corn, measured it out,
and distributed it in certain quantities.</p>


<p id="Sitou">SĪTOU DĬCĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σίτου δίκη</span>). If anything
happened to sever a marriage contract, the
husband or his representative was bound to
repay the marriage portion (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προῖξ</span>); or, if he
failed to do so, he was liable to pay interest
upon it at the rate of eighteen per cent. per
annum. A woman’s fortune was usually
secured by a mortgage of the husband’s property;
but whether this was so or not, her
guardian might bring an action against the
party who unjustly withheld it; <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη προικὸς</span>,
to recover the principal, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίκη σίτου</span>, for the
interest. The interest was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σῖτος</span> (alimony
or maintenance), because it was the
income out of which the woman had to be
maintained. The word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σῖτος</span> is often used
generally for provisions, just as we use the
word <em>bread</em>.</p>


<p id="Situla">SĬTŬLA, <em>dim.</em> SĬTELLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑδρία</span>), was probably
a bucket or pail for drawing and
carrying water, but was more usually applied
to the vessel from which lots were drawn.
The diminutive <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sitella</i>, however, was more
commonly used in this signification. It appears
that the vessel was filled with water (as
among the Greeks, whence the word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑδρία</span>),
and that the lots (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sortes</i>) were made of wood;
and as, though increasing in size below, it
had a narrow neck, only one lot could come
to the top of the water at the same time,
when it was shaken. The vessel used for
drawing lots was also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">urna</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">orca</i> as
well as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Situla</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitella</i>. It is important to understand
the difference in meaning, between
Sitella and Cista, in their use in the comitia
and courts of justice, since they have been
frequently confounded. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitella</i> was the
urn, from which the names of the tribes or
centuries were drawn out by lot, so that each
might have its proper place in voting, and
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cista</i> was the ballot-box into which the
tabellae were cast in voting. The Cista
seems to have been made of wicker or similar
work.</p>

<p id="Socii">SŎCĬI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύμμαχοι</span>). In the early times,
when Rome formed equal alliances with any
of the surrounding nations, these nations
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socii</i>. After the dissolution of
the Latin league, when the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latini</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nomen Latinum</i>, was artificially applied to a
great number of Italians, only a few of whom
were real inhabitants of the old Latin towns,
and the majority of whom had been made
Latins by the will and the law of Rome,
there necessarily arose a difference between
these Latins and the Socii, and the expression
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socii Nomen Latinum</i> is one of the old
asyndeta, instead of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socii et Nomen Latinum</i>.
The Italian allies again must be distinguished
from foreign allies. The Italian allies consisted,
for the most part, of such nations as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
had either been conquered by the Romans,
or had come under their dominion through
other circumstances. When such nations
formed an alliance with Rome, they generally
retained their own laws; or if they
were not allowed this privilege at first, they
usually obtained it subsequently. The condition
of the Italian allies varied, and mainly
depended upon the manner in which they
had come under the Roman dominion; but
in reality they were always dependent upon
Rome. The following are the principal duties
which the Italian Socii had to perform towards
Rome: they had to send subsidies in
troops, money, corn, ships, and other things,
whenever Rome demanded them. The number
of troops requisite for completing or increasing
the Roman armies was decreed
every year by the senate, and the consuls
fixed the amount which each allied nation
had to send; in proportion to its population
capable of bearing arms, of which each nation
was obliged to draw up accurate lists, called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">formulae</i>. The consul also appointed the
place and time at which the troops of the
socii, each part under its own leader, had to
meet him and his legions. The infantry of
the allies in a consular army was usually
equal in numbers to that of the Romans; the
cavalry was generally three times the number
of the Romans: but these numerical proportions
were not always observed. The consuls
appointed twelve praefects as commanders of
the socii, and their power answered to that
of the twelve military tribunes in the consular
legions. These praefects, who were
probably taken from the allies themselves,
and not from the Romans, selected a third of
the cavalry, and a fifth of the infantry of the
socii, who formed a select detachment for
extraordinary cases, and who were called the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extraordinarii</i>. The remaining body of the
socii was then divided into two parts, called
the right and the left wing. The infantry of
the wings was, as usual, divided into cohorts,
and the cavalry into turmae. In some cases
also legions were formed of the socii. Pay
and clothing were given to the allied troops
by the states or towns to which they belonged,
and which appointed quaestors or
paymasters for this purpose: but Rome furnished
them with provisions at the expense
of the republic: the infantry received the
same as the Roman infantry, but the cavalry
only received two-thirds of what was given
to the Roman cavalry. In the distribution
of the spoil and of conquered lands they frequently
received the same share as the Romans.
They were never allowed to take up
arms of their own accord, and disputes among
them were settled by the senate. Notwithstanding
all this, the socii fell gradually
under the arbitrary rule of the senate and
the magistrates of Rome; and after the year
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 173, it even became customary for magistrates,
when they travelled through Italy,
to demand of the authorities of allied towns
to pay homage to them, to provide them with
a residence, and to furnish them with beasts
of burden when they continued their journey.
The only way for the allies to obtain any
protection against such arbitrary proceedings,
was to enter into a kind of clientela with
some influential and powerful Roman. Socii
who revolted against Rome were frequently
punished with the loss of their freedom, or
of the honour of serving in the Roman
armies. Such punishments however varied
according to circumstances. After the civitas
had been granted to all the Italians by the
Lex Julia de Civitate (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 90), the relation
of the Italian socii to Rome ceased. But
Rome had long before this event applied the
name Socii to foreign nations also which were
allied with Rome, though the meaning of the
word in this case differed from that of the
Socii Italici. There were two principal kinds
of alliances with foreign nations: 1. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foedus
aequum</i>, such as might be concluded either
after a war in which neither party had
gained a decisive victory, or with a nation
with which Rome had never been at war;
2. a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foedus iniquum</i>, when a foreign nation
conquered by the Romans was obliged to
form the alliance on any terms proposed by
the conquerors. In the latter case the foreign
nation was to some extent subject to Rome,
and obliged to comply with anything that
Rome might demand. But all foreign socii,
whether they had an equal or unequal alliance,
were obliged to send subsidies in troops
when Rome demanded them; these troops,
however, did not, like those of the Italian
socii, serve in the line, but were employed
as light-armed soldiers, and were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">milites auxiliares</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auxiliarii</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auxilia</i>, or sometimes
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auxilia externa</i>. Towards the end of
the republic all the Roman allies, whether
they were nations or kings, sank down to the
condition of mere subjects or vassals of Rome,
whose freedom and independence consisted in
nothing but a name. [Compare <span class="smcap"><a href="#Foederatae">Foederatae

in this way, as at Praeneste, Caere,

tablets or counters, made of wood or other
materials, and were commonly thrown into
a sitella or urn, filled with water, as is explained
under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Situla">Situla</a></span>. The lots were sometimes
thrown like dice. The name of sortes
was in fact given to anything used to determine

were written upon the lots according to circumstances,
as for instance the names of the
persons using them, &amp;c.: it seems to have
been a favourite practice in later times to
write the verses of illustrious poets upon
little tablets, and to draw them out of the

thus obtained being supposed to be applicable
to him.</p>

<p id="Speculatores">SPĔCŬLĀTŌRES, or EXPLŌRĀTŌRES,
were scouts or spies sent before an army, to
reconnoitre the ground and observe the

a mirror, a looking-glass. The looking-glasses
of the ancients were usually made
of metal, at first of a composition of tin and
copper, but afterwards more frequently of
silver. The ancients seem to have had glass
mirrors also like ours, consisting of a glass
plate covered at the back with a thin leaf of
metal. They were manufactured as early as
the time of Pliny at the celebrated glass-houses
of Sidon, but they must have been inferior
to those of metal, since they never
came into general use, and are never mentioned
by ancient writers among costly
pieces of furniture, whereas metal mirrors
frequently are. Looking-glasses were generally
small, and such as could be carried in
the hand. Instead of their being fixed so as
to be hung against the wall or to stand upon
the table or floor, they were generally held
by female slaves before their mistresses when
dressing.</p>

the Doric order of Greek architecture, but
was always present in the Ionic and Corinthian,
and, besides the bases properly
belonging to those orders, there was one
called the Attic, which may be regarded as a
variety of the Ionic [<span class="smcap">Atticurges</span>]. In the

divided by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scotia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρόχιλος</span>), and in the

<p id="Spolia">SPŎLĬA. Four words are commonly employed
to denote booty taken in war, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praeda,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
anubiae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exuviae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spolia</i>. Of these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praeda</i>
bears the most comprehensive meaning, being
used for plunder of every description. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Manubiae</i>
would seem strictly to signify that portion
of the spoil which fell to the share of
the commander-in-chief, the proceeds of
which were frequently applied to the erection
of some public building. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exuviae</i> indicates
anything stripped from the person of a foe,
while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spolia</i>, properly speaking, ought to be
confined to armour and weapons, although
both words are applied loosely to trophies,
such as chariots, standards, beaks of ships
and the like, which might be preserved and
displayed. Spoils collected on the battlefield
after an engagement, or found in a
captured town, were employed to decorate
the temples of the gods, triumphal arches,
porticoes, and other places of public resort,
and sometimes in the hour of extreme need
served to arm the people; but those which
were gained by individual prowess were
considered the undoubted property of the
successful combatant, and were exhibited in
the most conspicuous part of his dwelling,
being hung up in the atrium, suspended
from the door-posts, or arranged in the vestibulum,
with appropriate inscriptions. They
were regarded as peculiarly sacred, so that
even if the house was sold the new possessor
was not permitted to remove them. But
while on the one hand it was unlawful to
remove spoils, so it was forbidden to <em>replace</em>
or <em>repair</em> them when they had fallen down or
become decayed through age; the object of
this regulation being doubtless to guard
against the frauds of false pretenders. Of
all spoils the most important were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spolia
opima</i>, a term applied to those only which
the commander-in-chief of a Roman army
stripped in a field of battle from the leader
of the foe. Plutarch expressly asserts that
Roman history up to his own time afforded
but three examples of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spolia opima</i>. The
first were said to have been won by Romulus
from Acro, king of the Caeninenses, the
second by Aulus Cornelius Cossus from Lar
Tolumnius, king of the Veientes, the third by
M. Claudius Marcellus from Viridomarus,
king of the Gaesatae. In all these cases, in
accordance with the original institution, the
spoils were dedicated to Jupiter Feretrius.</p>


<p id="Sponsa">SPONSA, SPONSUS, SPONSĀLĬA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Matrimonium">Matrimonium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Sportula">SPORTŬLA. In the days of Roman freedom,
clients were in the habit of testifying
respect for their patron by thronging his
atrium at an early hour, and escorting him
to places of public resort when he went
abroad. As an acknowledgment of these
courtesies, some of the number were usually
invited to partake of the evening meal.
After the extinction of liberty, the presence
of such guests, who had now lost all political
importance, was soon regarded as an irksome
restraint, while at the same time many of
the noble and wealthy were unwilling to
sacrifice the pompous display of a numerous
body of retainers. Hence the practice was
introduced under the empire of bestowing on
each client, when he presented himself for his
morning visit, a certain portion of food as a substitute
and compensation for the occasional invitation
to a regular supper (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coena recta</i>), and
this dole, being carried off in a little basket provided
for the purpose, received the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sportula</i>. For the sake of convenience it
soon became common to give an equivalent
in money, the sum established by general
usage being a hundred quadrantes. The
donation in money, however, did not entirely
supersede the sportula given in kind, for we
find in Juvenal a lively description of a great
man’s vestibule crowded with dependents,
each attended by a slave bearing a portable
kitchen to receive the viands and keep them
hot while they were carried home. Under
the empire great numbers of the lower orders
derived their whole sustenance, and the
funds for ordinary expenditure, exclusively
from this source, while even the highborn
did not scruple to increase their incomes by
taking advantage of the ostentatious profusion
of the rich and vain.</p>


<p id="Stadium">STĂDĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ στάδιος</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ στάδιον</span>), a
Greek measure of length, and the chief one
used for itinerary distances. It was equal to
600 Greek or 625 Roman feet, or to 125
Roman paces; and the Roman mile contained
8 stadia. Hence the stadium contained 606
feet 9 inches English. This standard prevailed
throughout Greece, under the name of
the Olympic stadium, so called because it was
the exact length of the stadium or foot-race
course at Olympia, measured between the
pillars at the two extremities of the course.
The first use of the measure seems to be contemporaneous
with the formation of the
stadium at Olympia when the Olympic games
were revived by Iphitus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 884 or 828).
This distance doubled formed the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίαυλος</span>, the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππικον</span> was 4 stadia, and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δόλιχος</span> is differently
stated at 6, 7, 8, 12, 20, and 24
stadia. A day’s journey by land was reckoned
at 200 or 180 stadia, or for an army 150
stadia. The stadium at Olympia was used
not only for the foot-race, but also for the
other contests which were added to the games
from time to time [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Olympia">Olympia</a></span>], except the
horse-races, for which a place was set apart,
of a similar form with the stadium, but
larger; this was called the Hippodrome (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱππόδρομος</span>).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
The name stadium was also given
to all other places throughout Greece wherever
games were celebrated. The stadium was an
oblong area terminated at one end by a straight
line, at the other by a semicircle having the
breadth of the stadium for its base. Round
this area were ranges of seats rising above
one another in steps.</p>


<p id="Stater">STĀTĒR (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στατῆρ</span>), which means simply <em>a
standard</em> (in this case both of weight and
more particularly of money), was the name
of the principal gold coin of Greece, which
was also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσοῦς</span>). The stater
is said to have been first coined in Lydia by
Croesus, and probably did not differ materially
from the stater which was afterwards
current in Greece, and which was equal <em>in
weight</em> to <em>two</em> drachmae, and <em>in value</em> to
<em>twenty</em>. The Macedonian stater, which was
the one most in use after the time of Philip
and his son Alexander the Great, was of the
value of about 1<em>l.</em> 3<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> In calculating the
value of the stater in our money the ratio of
gold to silver must not be overlooked. Thus
the stater of Alexander, which we have
valued, according to the present worth of gold,
at 1<em>l.</em> 3<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, passed for twenty drachmae,
which, according to the present value of
silver, were worth only 16<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> But the
former is the true worth of the stater, the
difference arising from the greater value of
silver in ancient times than now.</p>


<p id="Stationes">STĂTĬŌNES. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Castra">Castra</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Stator">STĂTOR, a public servant, who attended
on the Roman magistrates in the provinces.
The Statores seem to have derived their name
from standing by the side of the magistrate,
and thus being at hand to execute all his
commands; they appear to have been chiefly
employed in carrying letters and messages.</p>


<p id="Statuaria">STĀTŬĀRĬA ARS is in its proper sense
the art of making statues or busts, whether
they consist of stone or metal or other materials,
and includes the art of making the
various kinds of reliefs (alto, basso, and
mezzo relievo). These arts in their infant
state existed among the Greeks from time
immemorial. There is no material applicable
to statuary which was not used by the Greeks.
As <em>soft clay</em> is capable of being shaped without
difficulty into any form, and is easily
dried, either by being exposed to the sun or
by being baked, we may consider this substance
to have been the earliest material of
which figures were made. The name plastic
art (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡ πλαστική</span>), by which the ancients sometimes
designate the art of statuary, properly
signifies to form or shape a thing of clay.
The second material was <em>wood</em>, and figures
made of wood were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξόανα</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξέω</span>,
“polish” or “carve.” It was chiefly used
for making images of the gods, and probably
more on account of the facility of working in
it, than for any other reason. <em>Stone</em> was
little used in statuary during the early ages
of Greece, though it was not altogether unknown,
as we may infer from the relief on
the Lion-gate of Mycenae. In Italy, where
the soft peperino afforded an easy material
for working, stone appears to have been used
at an earlier period and more commonly than
in Greece. But in the historical times the
Greeks used all the principal varieties of
marble for their statues. Different kinds of
marble and of different colours were sometimes
used in one and the same statue, in
which case the work is called Polylithic statuary.
<em>Bronze</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χάλκος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aes</i>), <em>silver</em>, and <em>gold</em>
were used profusely in the state of society
described in the Homeric poems. At that
period, however, and long after, the works
executed in metal were made by means of the
hammer, and the different pieces were joined
together by pins, rivets, cramps, or other
mechanical fastenings, and, as the art advanced,
by a kind of glue, cement, or solder.
Iron came into use much later, and the art of
casting both bronze and iron is ascribed to
Rhoecus and to Theodoras of Samos. <em>Ivory</em>
was employed at a later period than any of
the before-mentioned materials, and then was
highly valued both for its beauty and rarity.
In its application to statuary, ivory was
generally combined with gold, and was used
for the parts representing the flesh. The
history of ancient art, and of statuary in particular,
may be divided into five periods.</p>

<p>I. <em>First Period, from the earliest times till
about 580</em> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;Three kinds of artists may
be distinguished in the mythical period.
The first consists of gods and daemons; such
as Athena, Hephaestus, the Phrygian or Dardanian
Dactyli, and the Cabiri. The second
contains whole tribes of men distinguished
from others by the mysterious possession of
superior skill in the practice of the arts, such
as the Telchines and the Cyclopes. The
third consists of individuals who are indeed
described as human beings, but yet are
nothing more than personifications of particular
branches of art, or the representatives
of families of artists. Of the latter the most
celebrated is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Daedalus</i>, whose name indicates
nothing but a smith, or an artist in general,
and who is himself the mythical ancestor of
a numerous family of artists (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Daedalids</i>),
which can be traced from the time of Homer
to that of Plato, for even Socrates is said to
have been a descendant of this family. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Smilis</i>
(from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σμίλη</span>, a carving-knife) exercised his
art in Samos, Aegina, and other places, and
some remarkable works were attributed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
him. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Endoeus</i> of Athens is called a disciple
of Daedalus. According to the popular traditions
of Greece, there was no period in
which the gods were not represented in some
form or other, and there is no doubt that for
a long time there existed no other statues in
Greece than those of the gods. The earliest
representations of the gods, however, were
only symbolic. The presence of a god was
indicated by the simplest and most shapeless
symbols, such as unhewn blocks of stone (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λίθοι
ἀργοί</span>), and by simple pillars or pieces of wood.
The general name for a representation of a
god not consisting of such a rude symbol was
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγαλμα</span>. In the Homeric poems there are sufficient
traces of the existence of statues of the
gods; but they probably did not display any
artistic beauty. The only work of art which
has come down to us from the heroic age is
the relief above the ancient gate of Mycenae,
representing two lions standing on their hind
legs, with a sort of pillar between them (woodcut
under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Murus">Murus</a></span>). The time which elapsed
between the composition of the Homeric
poems and the beginning of the fifth century
before our aera may be termed the age of discovery;
for nearly all the inventions, upon
the application of which <ins class="corr" id="tn-350" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the developement of'">
the development of</ins>
the arts is dependent, are assigned to this
period. Glaucus of Chios or Samos is said to
have invented the art of soldering metal
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιδήρου κόλλησις</span>). The two artists most
celebrated for their discoveries were the two
brothers Telecles and Theodoras of Samos,
about the time of Polycrates. They invented
the art of casting figures of metal. During
the whole of this period, though marble and
bronze began to be extensively applied, yet
wood was more generally used for representations
of the gods. These statues were
painted [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pictura">Pictura</a></span>], and in most cases dressed
in the most gorgeous attire. The style in
which they are executed is called the <em>archaic</em>
or the <em>hieratic</em> style. The figures are stiff
and clumsy, the countenances have little or
no individuality, the eyes long and small, and
the outer angles turned a little upwards; the
mouth, which is likewise drawn upwards at
the two corners, has a smiling appearance.
The hair is carefully worked, but looks stiff
and wiry, and hangs generally down in
straight lines, which are curled at the ends.
The arms hang down the sides of the body,
unless the figure carries something in its
hands. The drapery is likewise stiff, and the
folds are very symmetrical and worked with
little regard to nature.</p>

<p>II. <em>Second Period, from 580 to 480</em> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;The
number of artists who flourished during
this period is truly astonishing. The Ionians
of Asia Minor and the islanders of the Aegean,
who had previously been in advance of the
other Greeks in the exercise of the fine
arts, had their last flourishing period from
560 to 528 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Works in metal were
produced in high perfection in Samos, in
Aegina and Argos, while Chios gained the
greatest reputation from its possessing the
earliest great school of sculptors in marble, in
which Bupalus and Anthermus were the
most distinguished about 540 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Their
works were scattered over various parts of
Greece, and their value may be inferred from
the fact that Augustus adorned with them
the pediment of the temple of Apollo on the
Palatine. Sicyon also possessed a celebrated
school of sculptors in marble, and about 580
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Dipoenus and Scyllis, who had come from
Crete, were at the head of it, and executed
several marble statues of gods. Respecting
Magna Graecia and Sicily we know few particulars,
though it appears that the arts here
went on improving and continued to be in advance
of the mother-country. The most celebrated
artists in southern Italy were Dameas
of Croton, and Pythagoras of Rhegium. In
Athens the arts made great progress under
the patronage of the Pisistratids. The most
celebrated among the Athenian sculptors of
this period were Critias and Hegias, or Hegesias,
both distinguished for their works in
bronze. The former of them made in 477 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
the statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton.
Argos also distinguished itself, and it is a
curious circumstance, that the greatest Attic
artists with whom the third period opens, and
who brought the Attic art to its culminating
point, are disciples of the Argive Ageladas
(about 516 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) In the statues of the gods
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγάλματα</span>), which were made for temples as
objects of worship, the hieratic style was more
or less conscientiously retained, and it is therefore
not in these statues that we have to seek
for proofs of the progress of art. But even in
temple-statues wood began to give way to
other and better materials. Besides bronze,
marble also, and ivory and gold were now
applied to statues of the gods, and it was not
uncommon to form the body of a statue of
wood, and to make its head, arms, and feet
of stone (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀκρόλιθοι</span>), or to cover the whole of
such a wooden figure with ivory and gold.
From the statues of the gods erected for worship
we must distinguish those statues which
were dedicated in temples as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναθήματα</span>, and
which now became customary instead of
craters, tripods, &amp;c. In these the artists
were not only not bound to any traditional or
conventional forms, but were, like the poets,
allowed to make free use of mythological subjects,
to add, and to omit, or to modify the
stories, so as to render them more adapted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
for their artistic purposes. A third class of
statues, which were erected during this
period in great numbers, were those of the
victors in the national games, and, though
more rarely, of other distinguished persons
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνδριάντες</span>). Those of the latter kind appear
generally to have been portraits (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰκόνες</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">statuae iconicae</i>). The first iconic statues
of Harmodius and Aristogiton were made
by Antenor in 509 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and in 477 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
new statues of the same persons were made
by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Critias</i>. It was also at the period we
are now describing that it became customary
to adorn the pediments, friezes, and other
parts of temples with reliefs or groups of
statues of marble. We still possess two
great works of this kind which are sufficient
to show their general character during this
period. 1. The <em>Selinuntine Marbles</em>, or the
metopes of two temples on the acropolis of
Selinus in Sicily, which were discovered in
1823, and are at present in the Museum
of Palermo. 2. The <em>Aeginetan Marbles</em>,
which were discovered in 1812 in the island
of Aegina, and are now at Munich. They
consist of eleven statues, which adorned
two pediments of a temple of Athena, and
represent the goddess leading the Aeacids
against Troy, and contain manifest allusions
to the war of the Greeks with the Persians.</p>

<p id="Iii">III. <em>Third Period, from 480 to 336</em> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;During
this period Athens was the centre
of the fine arts in Greece. Statuary went
hand in hand with the other arts and with
literature: it became emancipated from its
ancient fetters, from the stiffness and conventional
forms of former times, and reached
its culminating point in the sublime and
mighty works of Phidias. His career begins
about 452 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The genius of this artist
was so great and so generally recognised,
that all the great works which were executed
in the age of Pericles were placed
under his direction, and thus the whole host
of artists who were at that time assembled at
Athens were engaged in working out his designs
and ideas. Of these we have still
some remains:&mdash;1. Parts of the eighteen
sculptured metopes, together with the frieze
of the small sides of the cella of the temple of
Theseus. Ten of the metopes represent the
exploits of Hercules, and the eight others
those of Theseus. The figures in the frieze
are manifestly gods, but their meaning is uncertain.
Casts of these figures are in the
British Museum. 2. A considerable number
of the metopes of the Parthenon, which are
all adorned with reliefs in marble, a great
part of the frieze of the cella, some colossal
figures, and a number of fragments of the
two pediments of this temple. The greater
part of these works is now in the British
Museum, where they are collected under the
name of the Elgin Marbles. Besides the
sculptures of these temples, there are also
similar ornaments of other temples extant,
which show the influence which the school of
Phidias exercised in various parts of Greece.
Of these the most important are, the Phigalian
marbles, which belonged to the temple of Apollo
Epicurius, built about 436 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, by Ictinus.
They were discovered in 1812, and consist of
twenty-three plates of marble belonging to
the inner frieze of the cella. They are now
in the British Museum. The subjects represented
in them are fights with Centaurs and
Amazons, and one plate shows Apollo and
Artemis drawn in a chariot by stags. About
the same time that the Attic school rose
to its highest perfection under Phidias, the
school of Argos was likewise raised to its
summit by Polycletus. The art of making
bronze statues of athletes was carried by him
to the greatest perfection: ideal youthful and
manly beauty was the sphere in which he excelled.
One of his statues, a youthful Doryphorus,
was made with such accurate observation
of the proportions of the parts of the
body, that it was looked upon by the ancient
artists as a canon of rules on this point.
Myron of Eleutherae, about 432 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, adhered
to a closer imitation of nature than Polycletus,
and as far as the impression upon the
senses was concerned, his works were most
pleasing. The cow of Myron in bronze was
celebrated in all antiquity. The change which
took place after the Peloponnesian war in the
public mind at Athens could not fail to show
its influence upon the arts also. It was especially
Scopas of Paros and Praxiteles of
Athens, about one generation after Myron
and Polycletus, who gave the reflex of their
time in their productions. Their works expressed
the softer feelings and an excited state
of mind, such as would make a strong impression
upon and captivate the senses of the
beholders. Both were distinguished as sculptors
in marble, and both worked in the same
style; the legendary circles to which most of
their ideal productions belong are those of
Dionysus and Aphrodite, a fact which also
shows the character of the age. Cephissodorus
and Timarchus were sons of Praxiteles.
There were several works of the former at
Rome in the time of Pliny; he made his art
subservient to passions and sensual desires.
Most of the above-mentioned artists, however
widely their works differed from those of the
school of Phidias, may yet be regarded as
having only continued and developed its
principles of art in a certain direction; but
towards the end of this period Euphranor and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
Lysippus of Sicyon carried out the principles
of the Argive school of Polycletus. Their
principal object was to represent the highest
possible degree of physical beauty and of athletic
and heroic power. The chief characteristic
of Lysippus and his school is a close
imitation of nature, which even contrived to
represent bodily defects in some interesting
manner, as in his statues of Alexander.</p>

<p id="Iv">IV. <em>Fourth Period, from 336 to 146</em> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>&mdash;During
the first fifty years of this period
the schools of Praxiteles and Lysippus continued
to flourish, especially in works of
bronze; but after this time bronze statues
were seldom made, until the art was carried
on with new vigour at Athens about the
end of the period. The school of Lysippus
gave rise to that of Rhodes, where his disciple
Chares formed the most celebrated
among the hundred colossal statues of the
sun. It was seventy cubits high, and partly
of metal. It stood near the harbour, and was
thrown down by an earthquake about 225
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Antiquarians assign to this part of the
fourth period several very beautiful works
still extant, as the magnificent group of Laocoon
and his sons, which was discovered in
1506 near the baths of Titus, and is at present
at Rome. This is, next to the Niobe, the most
beautiful group among the extant works of
ancient art; it was according to Pliny the
work of three Rhodian artists: Agesander,
Polydorus, and Athenodorus. The celebrated
Farnesian bull is likewise the work of two
Rhodian artists, Apollonius and Tauriscus.
In the various kingdoms which arose out of
the conquests of Alexander the arts were
more or less cultivated. Not only were the
great master-works of former times copied to
adorn the new capitals, but new schools of
artists sprang up in several of them. At
Pergamus the celebrated groups were composed
which represented the victories of Attalus
and Eumenes over the Gauls. It is
believed by some that the so-called dying
gladiator at Rome is a statue of a Gaul, which
originally belonged to one of these groups.
The Borghese gladiator in the Louvre is supposed
to be the work of an Ephesian Agasias,
and to have originally formed a part of such a
battle-scene. About the close of this period,
and for more than a century afterwards, the
Romans, in the conquest of the countries
where the arts had flourished, made it a
regular practice to carry away the works of
art. The triumphs over Philip, Antiochus,
the Aetolians, the Gauls in Asia, Perseus,
Pseudo-Philip, and above all the taking of
Corinth, and subsequently the victories over
Mithridates and Cleopatra, filled the Roman
temples and porticoes with the greatest
variety of works of art. The sacrilegious
plunder of temples and the carrying away of
the sacred statues from the public sanctuaries
became afterwards a common practice. The
manner in which Verres acted in Sicily is but
one of many instances of the extent to which
these robberies were carried on. The emperors,
especially Augustus, Caligula, and
Nero, followed these examples, and the immense
number of statues which, notwithstanding
all this, remained at Rhodes, Delphi,
Athens, and Olympia, is truly astonishing.&mdash;We
can only briefly advert to the history of
statuary among the Etruscans and Romans
down to the year 146 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The Etruscans
were on the whole an industrious and enterprising
people. With the works of Grecian
art they must have become acquainted at an
early time through their intercourse with the
Greeks of southern Italy, whose influence
upon the art of the Etruscans is evident in
numerous cases. The whole range of the
fine arts was cultivated by the Etruscans at
an early period. Statuary in clay (which
here supplied the place of wood, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξόανα</span>, used
in Greece) and in bronze appears to have
acquired a high degree of perfection. In 267
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> no fewer than 2000 bronze statues are
said to have existed at Volsinii, and numerous
works of Etruscan art are still extant, which
show great vigour and life, though they do
not possess a very high degree of beauty.
Some of their statues are worked in a Greek
style; others are of a character peculiar to
themselves, and entirely different from works
of Grecian art, being stiff and ugly: others
again are exaggerated and forced in their
movements and attitudes, and resemble the
figures which we meet with in the representations
of Asiatic nations. The Romans
previously to the time of the first Tarquin
are said to have had no images of the gods;
and for a long time afterwards their statues
of gods in clay or wood were made by Etruscan
artists. During the early part of the
republic the works executed at Rome were
altogether of a useful and practical, and not
of an ornamental character; and statuary was
in consequence little cultivated. But in the
course of time the senate and the people, as
well as foreign states which desired to show
their gratitude to some Roman, began to
erect bronze statues to distinguished persons
in the Forum and other places.</p>

<p id="V">V. <em>fifth period, from</em> <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> <em>146 to the fall
of the Western Empire.</em>&mdash;During this period
Rome was the capital of nearly the whole of
the ancient world, not through its intellectual
superiority, but by its military and political
power. But it nevertheless became the centre
of art and literature, as the artists resorted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
thither from all parts of the empire for
the purpose of seeking employment in the
houses of the great. The mass of the people,
however, had as little taste for and were
as little concerned about the arts as ever.
In the time of Nero, who did much for the
arts, we meet with Zenodorus, a founder of
metal statues, who was commissioned by the
emperor to execute a colossal statue of 110
feet high, representing Nero as the Sun. In
the reign of Hadrian the arts seem to begin
a new aera. He himself was undoubtedly a
real lover of art, and encouraged it not only
at Rome, but in Greece and Asia Minor.
The great Villa of Hadrian below Tivoli, the
ruins of which cover an extent of ten Roman
miles in circumference, was richer in works
of art than any other place in Italy. Here
more works of art have been dug out of the
ground than anywhere else within the same
compass. Some statues executed at this time
are worthy of the highest admiration. Foremost
among these stand the statues and busts
of Antinous, for whom the emperor entertained
a passionate partiality, and who was
represented in innumerable works of art.
The colossal bust of Antinous in the Louvre
is reckoned one of the finest works of ancient
art, and is placed by some critics on an
equality with the best works that Greece has
produced. There are also some very good
works in red marble which are referred to
this period, as that material is not known to
have been used before the age of Hadrian.
As the arts had received such encouragement
and brought forth such fruits in the reign of
Hadrian, the effects remained visible for some
time during the reigns of the Antonines.
The frieze of a temple, which the senate
caused to be erected to Antoninus Pius and
Faustina, is adorned with griffins and vessels
of very exquisite workmanship. The best
among the extant works of this time are the
equestrian statue of M. Aurelius of gilt
bronze, which stands on the Capitol, and the
column of M. Aurelius with reliefs representing
scenes of his war against the Marcomanni.
After the time of the Antonines the
symptoms of decline in the arts became more
and more visible. The most numerous works
continued to be busts and statues of the emperors,
but the best among them are not free
from affectation and mannerism. In the time
of Caracalla many statues were made, especially
of Alexander the Great. Alexander
Severus was a great admirer of statues, not
from a genuine love of art, but because he
delighted in the representations of great and
good men. The reliefs on the triumphal
arch of Septimius Severus, representing his
victories over the Parthians, Arabs, and Adiabenians,
have scarcely any artistic merits.
Art now declined with great rapidity: busts
and statues were more seldom made than
before, and are awkward and poor; the hair
is frequently indicated by nothing else but
holes bored in the stone. The reliefs on the
sarcophagi gradually become monotonous and
lifeless. The reliefs on the arch of Constantine,
which are not taken from that of Trajan,
are perfectly rude and worthless, and those
on the column of Theodosius were not better.
Before concluding, it remains to say a few
words on the destruction of ancient works of
art. During the latter part of the reign of
Constantine many statues of the gods were
destroyed, and not long after his time a systematic
destruction began, which under Theodosius
spread to all parts of the empire. The
spirit of destruction, however, was not directed
against works of art in general and as
such, but only against the pagan idols. The
opinion, therefore, which is entertained by
some, that the losses we have sustained in
works of ancient art, are mainly attributable
to the introduction of Christianity, is too
sweeping and general. Of the same character
is another opinion, according to which
the final decay of ancient art was a consequence
of the spiritual nature of the new religion.
The coincidence of the general introduction
of Christianity with the decay of the arts is
merely accidental. That the early Christians
did not despise the arts as such, is clear from
several facts. We know that they erected
statues to their martyrs, of which we have a
specimen in that of St. Hippolytus in the
Vatican library. The numerous works, lastly,
which have been found in the Christian catacombs
at Rome, might alone be a sufficient
proof that the early Christians were not hostile
towards the representation of the heroes
of their religion in works of art. In fact,
Christianity during the middle ages became
as much the mother of the arts of modern
times, as the religion of Greece was the mother
of ancient art. Another very general
and yet incorrect notion is, that the northern
barbarians after the conquest of Rome intentionally
destroyed works of art. This opinion
is not supported by any of the contemporary
historians, nor is it at all probable. The barbarians
were only anxious to carry with
them the most precious treasures in order to
enrich themselves; a statue must have been
an object of indifference to them. What perished,
perished naturally by the circumstances
and calamities of the times. In times
of need bronze statues were melted down and
the material used for other purposes; marble
statues were frequently broken to pieces and
used for building materials. If we consider<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
the history of Rome during the first centuries
after the conquest of Italy by the Germans,
we have every reason to wonder that so
many specimens of ancient art have come
down to our times. The greatest destruction,
at one time, of ancient works of art is supposed
to have occurred at the taking of Constantinople,
in the beginning of the thirteenth
century. Among the few works saved from
this devastation are the celebrated bronze
horses which now decorate the exterior of
St. Mark’s church at Venice. They have
been ascribed, but without sufficient authority,
to Lysippus.</p>


<p id="Stilus">STĬLUS or STỸLUS is in all probability
the same word with the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στύλος</span>, and
conveys the general idea of an object tapering
like an architectural column. It signifies,
(1) An iron instrument, resembling a
pencil in size and shape, used for writing
upon waxed tablets. At one end it was
sharpened to a point for scratching the
characters upon the wax, while the other
end, being flat and circular, served to render
the surface of the tablets smooth again, and
so to obliterate what had been written.
Thus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vertere stilum</i> means <em>to erase</em>, and
hence <em>to correct</em>. The stylus was also termed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">graphium</i>, and the case in which it was kept
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">graphiarium</i>.&mdash;(2) A sharp stake or spike
placed in pitfalls before an entrenchment,
to embarrass the progress of an attacking
enemy.</p>

<p id="Stipendiarii">STIPENDĬĀRĬI. The stipendiariae urbes
of the Roman provinces were so denominated,
as being subject to the payment of a fixed
money-tribute, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stipendium</i>, in contradistinction
to the vectigales, who paid a certain
portion as a tenth or twentieth of the produce
of their lands, their cattle, or customs.
The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stipendium</i> was used to signify the
tribute paid, as it was originally imposed for
and afterwards appropriated to the purpose
of furnishing the Roman soldiers with pay.
The condition of the urbes stipendiariae is
generally thought to have been more honourable
than that of the vectigales, but the distinction
between the two terms was not
always observed. The word stipendiarius is
also applied to a person who receives a fixed
salary or pay, as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stipendiarius miles</i>.</p>


<p id="Stipendium">STĪPENDĬUM, a pension or pay, from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stipem</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pendo</i>, because before silver was
coined at Rome the copper-money in use was
paid by weight and not by tale. According
to Livy, the practice of giving pay to the
Roman soldiers was not introduced till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
405, on the occasion of the taking of Tarracina
or Anxur. It is probable, however, that
they received pay before this time, but, since
it was not paid regularly, its first institution
was referred to this year. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 403 a
certain amount of pay was assigned to the
knights also, or <span class="smcap"><a href="#Equites">Equites</a></span>, <a href="#Page_156">p. 156</a>, <em>b</em>. This,
however, had reference to the citizens who
possessed an equestrian fortune, but had no
horse (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">equus publicus</i>) assigned to them by
the state, for it had always been customary
for the knights of the 18 centuries to receive
pay out of the common treasury, in the shape
of an allowance for the purchase of a horse,
and a yearly pension of 2000 asses for its
keep. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aes_e">Aes Equestre</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Aes_e">Aes Hordearium</a></span>.]
In the time of the republic the pay of a
legionary soldier amounted to two oboli, or
3⅓ asses; a centurion received double, and
an eques or horseman triple. Polybius states
that foot soldiers also received in corn every
month an allowance (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demensum</i>) of ⅔ of an
Attic medimnus, or about 2 bushels of wheat:
the horsemen 7 medimni of barley and 2 of
wheat. The infantry of the allies received
the same allowance as the Roman: the horsemen
1⅓ medimni of wheat and 5 of barley.
But there was this difference, that the allied
forces received their allowances as a gratuity;
the Roman soldiers, on the contrary,
had deducted from their pay the money value
of whatever they received in corn, armour,
or clothes. There was indeed a law passed
by C. Gracchus, which provided that besides
their pay the soldiers should receive from
the treasury an allowance for clothes; but
this law seems either to have been repealed
or to have fallen into disuse. The pay was
doubled for the legionaries by Julius Caesar
before the civil war. He also gave them
corn whenever he had the means, without
any restrictions. Under Augustus it appears
to have been raised to 10 asses a day (three
times the original sum). It was still further
increased by Domitian. The praetorian
cohorts received twice as much as the
legionaries.</p>


<p id="Stola">STŎLA, a female dress worn over the
tunic; it came as low as the ankles or feet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
and was fastened round the body by a girdle,
leaving above the breast broad folds. The
tunic did not reach much below the knee,
but the essential distinction between the tunic
and stola seems to have been that the latter
always had an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">instita</i> or flounce sewed to
the bottom and reaching to the instep. Over
the stola the palla or pallium was worn
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pallium">Pallium</a></span>], as we see in the cut annexed.
The stola was the characteristic dress of the
Roman matrons, as the toga was of the
Roman men. Hence the meretrices were
not allowed to wear it, but only a dark-coloured
toga; and accordingly Horace speaks
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">matrona</i> in contradistinction to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">togata</i>. For the same reason, women who
had been divorced from their husbands on
account of adultery, were not allowed to wear
the stola, but only the toga.</p>

<p id="Strategus">STRĂTĒGUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατηγός</span>), general. This
office and title seems to have been more
especially peculiar to the democratic states
of ancient Greece: we read of them, for
instance, at Athens, Tarentum, Syracuse,
Argos, and Thurii; and when the tyrants of
the Ionian cities in Asia Minor were deposed
by Aristagoras, he established strategi in
their room, to act as chief magistrates. The
strategi at Athens were instituted after the
remodelling of the constitution by Clisthenes,
to discharge the duties which had in former
times been performed either by the king or
the archon polemarchus. They were ten in
number, one for each of the ten tribes, and
chosen by the suffrages (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</span>) of the
people. Before entering on their duties they
were required to submit to a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">docimasia</i>, or
examination of their character; and no one
was eligible to the office unless he had legitimate
children, and was possessed of landed
property in Attica. They were, as their name
denotes, entrusted with the command on military
expeditions, with the superintendence of
all warlike preparations, and with the regulation
of all matters in any way connected
with the war department of the state. They
levied and enlisted the soldiers, either personally
or with the assistance of the taxiarchs.
They were entrusted with the collection and
management of the property-taxes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφοραί</span>)
raised for the purposes of war; and also presided
over the courts of justice in which any
disputes connected with this subject or the
trierarchy were decided. They nominated
from year to year persons to serve as
trierarchs. They had the power of convening
extraordinary assemblies of the people
in cases of emergency. But their most important
trust was the command in war, and
it depended upon circumstances to how many
of the number it was given. At Marathon
all the ten were present, and the chief command
came to each of them in turn. The
archon polemarchus also was there associated
with them, and, according to the ancient
custom, his vote in a council of war was
equal to that of any of the generals. Usually,
however, three only were sent out; one of
these (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίτος αὐτός</span>) was considered as the
commander-in-chief, but his colleagues had
an equal voice in a council of war. The
military chiefs of the Aetolian and Achaean
leagues were also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strategi</i>. The
Achaean <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strategi</i> had the power of convening
a general assembly of the league on extraordinary
occasions. Greek writers on Roman
affairs give the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strategi</i> to the
praetors.</p>

<p id="Supplicatio">SUPPLĬCĀTĬO, a solemn thanksgiving or
supplication to the gods, decreed by the senate,
when all the temples were opened, and
the statues of the gods frequently placed in
public upon couches (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulvinaria</i>), to which
the people offered up their thanksgivings and
prayers. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lectisternium">Lectisternium</a>.</span>] A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">supplicatio</i> was
decreed for two different reasons. 1. As a
thanksgiving, when a great victory had been
gained: it was usually decreed as soon as
official intelligence of the victory had been
received by a letter from the general in command.
The number of days during which it
was to last was proportioned to the importance
of the victory. Sometimes it was decreed
for only one day, but more commonly for
three or five days. A supplication of ten
days was first decreed in honour of Pompey
at the conclusion of the war with Mithridates,
and one of fifteen days after the victory over
the Belgae by Caesar, an honour which had
never been granted to any one before. Subsequently
a supplicatio of twenty days was
decreed after his conquest of Vercingetorix.
A supplicatio was usually regarded as a prelude
to a triumph, but it was not always
followed by one. This honour was conferred
upon Cicero on account of his suppression of
the conspiracy of Catiline, which had never
been decreed to any one before in a civil capacity
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">togatus</i>).&mdash;2. A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">supplicatio</i>, a solemn
supplication and humiliation, was also decreed
in times of public danger and distress, and on
account of prodigies, to avert the anger of
the gods.</p>


<p id="Sycophantes">SȲCŎPHANTĒS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συκοφάντης</span>). At an early
period in Attic history a law was made prohibiting
the exportation of figs. Whether it
was made in a time of dearth, or through
the foolish policy of preserving to the natives
the most valuable of their productions, we
cannot say. It appears, however, that the
law continued in force long after the cause of
its enactment, or the general belief of its
utility, had ceased to exist; and Attic fig-growers
exported their fruit in spite of prohibitions
and penalties. To inform against
a man for so doing was considered harsh and
vexatious; as all people are apt to think that
obsolete statutes may be infringed with impunity.
Hence the term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συκοφαντεῖν</span>, which
originally signified <em>to lay an information
against another for exporting figs</em>, came to
be applied to all ill-natured, malicious, groundless,
and vexatious accusations. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sycophantes</i>
in the time of Aristophanes and Demosthenes
designated a person of a peculiar class, not
capable of being described by any single word
in our language, but well understood and
appreciated by an Athenian. He had not
much in common with our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sycophant</i>, but
was a happy compound of the <em>common barrator,
informer, pettifogger, busybody, rogue,
liar, and slanderer</em>. The Athenian law permitted
any citizen (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸν βουλόμενον</span>) to give
information against public offenders, and
prosecute them in courts of justice. It was
the policy of the legislator to encourage the
detection of crime, and a reward (such as
half the penalty) was frequently given to the
successful accuser. Such a power, with such
a temptation, was likely to be abused, unless
checked by the force of public opinion, or
the vigilance of the judicial tribunals. Unfortunately,
the character of the Athenian
democracy and the temper of the judges
furnished additional incentives to the informer.
Eminent statesmen, orators, generals,
magistrates, and all persons of wealth
and influence were regarded with jealousy
by the people. The more causes came into
court, the more fees accrued to the judges,
and fines and confiscations enriched the
public treasury. The prosecutor therefore in
public causes, as well as the plaintiff in civil,
was looked on with a more favourable eye
than the defendant, and the chances of success
made the employment a lucrative one.
It was not always necessary to go to trial,
or even to commence legal proceedings.
The timid defendant was glad to compromise
the cause, and the conscious delinquent to
avert the threat of a prosecution, by paying
a sum of money to his opponent. Thriving
informers found it not very difficult to procure
witnesses, and the profits were divided
between them.</p>


<p id="Sylae">SȲLAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σῦλαι</span>). When a Greek state, or
any of its members, had received an injury or
insult from some other state or some of its
members, and the former was unwilling, or
not in a condition, to declare open war, it
was not unusual to give a commission, or
grant public authority to individuals to make
reprisals. This was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύλας</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σῦλα</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διδόναι</span>. This ancient practice may be compared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
with the modern one of granting letters
of marque and reprisal.</p>


<p id="Syllogeis">SYLLOGEIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συλλογεῖς</span>), usually called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συλλογεῖς τοῦ δήμου</span>, or the Collectors of the
People, were special commissioners at Athens,
who made out a list of the property of the
oligarchs previously to its confiscation.</p>


<p id="Symbolaeon">SYMBOLAEON, SỸNALLAGMA, SYNTHĒCĒ

are all words used to signify a contract, but
are distinguishable from one another. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συμβόλαιον</span>
is used of contracts and bargains
between private persons, and peculiarly of
loans of money. Thus, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συμβαλεῖν εἰς ἀνδράποδον</span>
is, to lend upon the security of a slave.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συνάλλαγμα</span> signifies any matter negotiated
or transacted between two or more persons,
whether a contract or anything else. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Συνθήκη</span>
is used of more solemn and important
contracts, not only of those made between
private individuals, but also of treaties and
conventions between kings and states.</p>


<p id="Symposium">SYMPŎSĬUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συμπόσιον</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comissatio</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">convivium</i>),
a drinking-party. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">symposium</i>
must be distinguished from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deipnon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεῖπνον</span>),
for though drinking almost always followed
a dinner-party, yet the former was
regarded as entirely distinct from the latter,
was regulated by different customs, and frequently
received the addition of many guests,
who were not present at the dinner. For
the Greeks did not usually drink at their
dinner, and it was not till the conclusion of
the meal that wine was introduced. Symposia
were very frequent at Athens. Their
enjoyment was heightened by agreeable conversation,
by the introduction of music and
dancing, and by games and amusements of
various kinds: sometimes, too, philosophical
subjects were discussed at them. The symposia
of Plato and Xenophon give us a lively
idea of such entertainments at Athens. The
name itself shows, that the enjoyment of
drinking was the main object of the symposia:
wine from the juice of the grape (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἴνος
ἀμπέλινος</span>) was the only drink partaken of by
the Greeks, with the exception of water.
The wine was almost invariably mixed with
water, and to drink it unmixed (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄκρατον</span>) was
considered a characteristic of barbarians.
The mixture was made in a large vessel
called the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Crater">Crater</a></span>, from which it was conveyed
into the drinking-cups. The guests at
a symposium reclined on couches, and were
crowned with garlands of flowers. A master
of the revels (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων τῆς πόσεως</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συμποσίαρχος</span>,
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεύς</span>) was usually chosen to conduct
the symposium, whose commands the whole
company had to obey, and who regulated the
whole order of the entertainment, proposed
the amusements, &amp;c. The same practice
prevailed among the Romans, and their symposiarch
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magister</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rex Convivii</i>,
or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arbiter Bibendi</i>. The choice
was generally determined by the throwing of
astragali or tali. The proportion in which
the wine and water were mixed was fixed by
him, and also how much each of the company
was to drink, for it was not usually
left to the option of each of the company to
drink as much or as little as he pleased.
The cups were always carried round from
right to left (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ δεξιά</span>), and the same order
was observed in the conversation, and in
everything that took place in the entertainment.
The company frequently drank to the
health of one another, and each did it especially
to the one to whom he handed the
same cup. Respecting the games and amusements
by which the symposia were enlivened,
it is unnecessary to say much here, as most
of them are described in separate articles in
this work. Enigmas or riddles (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰνίγματα</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γρῖφοι</span>) were among the most usual and
favourite modes of diversion. Each of the
company proposed one in turn to his right-hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
neighbour; if he solved it, he was rewarded
with a crown, a garland, a cake, or
something of a similar kind, and sometimes
with a kiss; if he failed, he had to drink a
cup of unmixed wine, or of wine mixed with
salt water, at one draught. The cottabos
was also another favourite game at symposia,
and was played at in various ways. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cottabus">Cottabus</a>.</span>]
Representations of symposia are
very common on ancient vases. Two guests
usually reclined on each couch (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κλίνη</span>), as
is explained on <a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>, but sometimes there
were five persons on one couch. A drinking-party
among the Romans was sometimes
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">convivium</i>, but the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">comissatio</i>
more nearly corresponds to the Greek symposium.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Comissatio">Comissatio</a>.</span>] The Romans, however,
usually drank during their dinner
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coena</i>), which they frequently prolonged
during many hours, in the later times of the
republic and under the empire. Their customs
connected with drinking differed little
from those of the Greeks, and have been incidentally
noticed above.</p>

<p id="Syndicus">SYNDĬCUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνδικος</span>), <em>an advocate</em>, is frequently
used as synonymous with the word
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">synegorus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνήγορος</span>), to denote any one who
pleads the cause of another, whether in a
court of justice or elsewhere, but was peculiarly
applied to those orators who were sent
by the state to plead the cause of their countrymen
before a foreign tribunal. Aeschines,
for example, was appointed to plead before
the Amphictyonic council on the subject of
the Delian temple; but a certain discovery
having been made, not very creditable to his
patriotism, the court of Arciopagus took upon
themselves to remove him, and appoint Hyperides
in his stead. There were other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">syndici</i>,
who acted rather as magistrates or judges
than as advocates, though they probably
derived their name from the circumstance of
their being appointed to protect the interests
of the state. These were extraordinary functionaries,
created from time to time to exercise
a jurisdiction in disputes concerning
confiscated property.</p>


<p id="Synedri">SỸNĔDRI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνεδροι</span>), a name given to the
members of any council, or any body of men
who sat together to consult or deliberate.
The congress of Greeks at Salamis is called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνέδριον</span>. Frequent reference is made to the
general assembly of the Greeks, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ κοινὸν τῶν
Ἑλλήνων συνέδριον</span>, at Corinth, Thermopylae,
or elsewhere. The congress of the states
belonging to the new Athenian alliance,
formed after <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 377, was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνέδριον</span>,
and the deputies <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνεδροι</span>, and the sums furnished
by the allies <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συντάξεις</span>, in order to
avoid the old and hateful name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φόρος</span> or
tribute. The name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνέδριον</span> was given at
Athens to any magisterial or official body, as
to the court of Areiopagus, or to the place
where they transacted business, their board
or council-room.</p>


<p id="Synegorus">SỸNĒGŎRUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνήγορος</span>). In causes of
importance, wherein the state was materially
interested, more especially in those which
were brought before the court upon an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσαγγελία</span>,
it was usual to appoint public advocates
(called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνήγοροι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνδικοι</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατήγοροι</span>)
to manage the prosecution. In ordinary cases
however the accuser or prosecutor (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατήγορος</span>)
was a distinct person from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνήγορος</span>,
who acted only as auxiliary to him. It
might be, indeed, that the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνήγορος</span> performed
the most important part at the trial,
or it might be that he performed a subordinate
part, making only a short speech in
support of the prosecution, which was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίλογος</span>. But however this might be, he
was in point of law an auxiliary only, and
was neither entitled to a share of the reward
(if any) given by the law to a successful accuser,
nor liable, on the other hand, to a
penalty of a thousand drachms, or the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτιμία</span>
consequent upon a failure to get a fifth part
of the votes. The fee of a drachm (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὸ συνηγορικόν</span>)
mentioned by Aristophanes was
probably the sum paid to the public advocate
whenever he was employed on behalf of the
state. There appears to have been (at least
at one period) a regular appointment of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνήγοροι</span>,
ten in number. For what purpose
they were appointed, is a matter about which
we have no certain information: but it is not
unreasonable to suppose that these ten <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνήγοροι</span>
were no other than the public advocates
who were employed to conduct state prosecutions.</p>


<p id="Syngraphe">SYNGRĂPHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συγγραφή</span>), signifies a written
contract: whereas <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνθήκη</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συμβόλαιον</span>
do not necessarily import that the
contract is in writing; and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁμολογία</span> is,
strictly speaking, a verbal agreement. At
Athens important contracts were usually reduced
to writing; such as leases (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μισθώσεις</span>),
loans of money, and all executory agreements,
where certain conditions were to be
performed. The whole was contained in a
little tablet of wax or wood (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βιβλίον</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραμματεῖον</span>,
sometimes double, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίπτυχον</span>), which
was sealed, and deposited with some third
person, mutually agreed on between the
parties.</p>


<p id="Synoikia">SỸNOIKĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συνοίκια</span>).&mdash;(1) A festival celebrated
every year at Athens on the 16th of
Hecatombaeon in honour of Athena. It was
believed to have been instituted by Theseus
to commemorate the concentration of the
government of the various towns of Attica
at Athens.&mdash;(2) A house adapted to hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
several families, a lodging-house, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insula</i>, as
the Romans would say. The lodging-houses
were let mostly to foreigners who came to
Athens on business, and especially to the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέτοικοι</span>, whom the law did not allow to
acquire real property, and who therefore
could not purchase houses of their own. The
rent was commonly paid by the month.
Lodging-houses were frequently taken on
speculation by persons called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναύκληροι</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σταθμοῦχοι</span>, who made a profit by underletting
them.</p>


<p id="Synthesis">SYNTHĔSIS, a garment frequently worn
at dinner, and sometimes also on other occasions.
As it was inconvenient to wear the
toga at table, on account of its many folds, it
was customary to have dresses especially appropriated
to this purpose, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestes coenatoriae</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coenatoria</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accubitoria</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">syntheses</i>.
The synthesis appears to have been a
kind of tunic, an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">indumentum</i> rather than an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amictus</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amictus">Amictus</a>.</span>] That it was, however,
an easy and comfortable kind of dress, as we
should say, seems to be evident from its use
at table above mentioned, and also from its
being worn by all classes at the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Saturnalia">Saturnalia</a></span>,
a season of universal relaxation and
enjoyment. More than this respecting its
form we cannot say; it was usually dyed
with some colour, and was not white, like the
toga.</p>


<p id="Syrinx">SȲRINX (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύριγξ</span>), the Pan’s pipe, or Pandean
pipe, was the appropriate musical instrument
of the Arcadian and other Grecian
shepherds, and was regarded by them as the
invention of Pan, their tutelary god. When
the Roman poets had occasion to mention it,
they called it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fistula</i>. It was formed in
general of seven hollow stems of cane or
reed, fitted together by means of wax, having
been previously cut to the proper lengths,
and adjusted so as to form an octave; but
sometimes nine were admitted, giving an
equal number of notes. A syrinx of eight
reeds is represented on <a href="#ill278b">p. 278</a>.</p>

<p id="Syrma">SYRMA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύρμα</span>), which properly means
that which is drawn or dragged (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύρω</span>),
is applied to a dress with a train. It was
more especially the name of the dress worn
by the tragic actors, which had a train to it
trailing upon the ground. Hence we find
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">syrma</i> used metaphorically for tragedy itself.</p>


<p id="Syssitia">SYSSĪTĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συσσίτια</span>). The custom of
taking the principal meal of the day in
public prevailed extensively amongst the
Greeks from very early ages, but more particularly
in Crete and at Sparta. The Cretan
name for the syssitia was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Andreia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνδρεῖα</span>),
the singular of which is used to denote the
building or public hall where they were
given. This title affords of itself a sufficient
indication that they were confined to men
and youths only. All the adult citizens partook
of the public meals amongst the Cretans,
and were divided into companies or “messes,”
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hetaeriae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑταιρίαι</span>), or sometimes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">andreia</i>.
The syssitia of the Cretans were
distinguished by simplicity and temperance.
They always <em>sat</em> at their tables, even in later
times, when the custom of reclining had been
introduced at Sparta. In most of the Cretan
cities, the expenses of the syssitia were defrayed
out of the revenues of the public
lands, and the tribute paid by the perioeci,
the money arising from which was applied
partly to the service of the gods, and partly
to the maintenance of all the citizens, both
male and female; so that in this respect
there might be no difference between the rich
and the poor. The Spartan syssitia were in the
main so similar to those of Crete, that one was
said to be borrowed from the other. They differed
from the Cretan in the following respects.
The expenses of the tables at Sparta were not
defrayed out of the public revenues, but every
head of a family was obliged to contribute a
certain portion at his own cost and charge;
those who were not able to do so were excluded
from the public tables. The guests were
divided into companies, generally of fifteen
persons each, and all vacancies were filled up
by ballot, in which unanimous consent was
indispensable for election. No persons, not
even the kings, were excused from attendance
at the public tables, except for some
satisfactory reason, as when engaged in a
sacrifice, or a chase, in which latter case the
individual was required to send a present to
his table. Each person was supplied with a
cup of mixed wine, which was filled again
when required: but drinking to excess was
prohibited at Sparta as well as in Crete.
The repast was of a plain and simple character,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
and the contribution of each member
of a mess (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φειδίτης</span>) was settled by law. The
principal dish was the black broth (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέλας
ζωμός</span>), with pork. Moreover, the entertainment
was enlivened by cheerful conversation,
though on public matters. Singing also was
frequently introduced. The arrangements
were under the superintendence of the polemarchs.</p>

tablet, with which each citizen and judex
voted in the comitia and courts of justice.

<p id="Tabellarius">TĂBELLĀRĬUS, a letter-carrier. As the
Romans had no public post, they were obliged
to employ special messengers, who were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabellarii</i>, to convey their letters (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabellae</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literae</i>), when they had not an opportunity
of sending them otherwise.</p>

<p id="Tabulae">TĂBŬLAE. This word properly means
planks or boards, whence it is applied to
several objects, as gaming-tables, pictures,
but more especially to tablets used for writing.
Generally, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabellae</i> signify waxen
tablets (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae ceratae</i>), which were thin
pieces of wood, usually of an oblong shape,
covered over with wax (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cera</i>). The wax was
written on by means of the stilus. These
tabulae were sometimes made of ivory and
citron-wood, but generally of the wood of a
more common tree, as the beech, fir, &amp;c. The
outer sides of the tablets consisted merely of
the wood; it was only the inner sides that
were covered over with wax. They were
fastened together at the back by means of
wires, which answered the purpose of hinges,
so that they opened and shut like our books;
and to prevent the wax of one tablet nibbing
against the wax of the other, there was a
raised margin around each, as is clearly seen
in the woodcut on <a href="#ill354">p. 354</a>. There were
sometimes two, three, four, five, or even
more, tablets fastened together in the above-mentioned
manner. Two such tablets were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diptycha</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίπτυχα</span>), which merely
means “twice-folded” (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πτύσσω</span>, “to
fold”), whence we have <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πτυκτίον</span>, or with
the τ omitted, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πυκτίον</span>. The Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pugillares</i>,
which is the name frequently given
to tablets covered with wax, may perhaps be
connected with the same root, though it is
usually derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pugillus</i>, because they
were small enough to be held in the hand.
Three tablets fastened together were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triptycha</i>; in the same way we also read of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pentaptycha</i>, and of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">polyptycha</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multiplices</i>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerae</i>). The pages of these tablets were
frequently called by the name of cerae alone;
thus we read of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima cera</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">altera cera</i>,
“first page,” “second page.” In tablets
containing important legal documents, especially
wills, the outer edges were pierced
through with holes (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foramina</i>), through
which a triple thread (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linum</i>) was passed,
and upon which a seal was then placed.
This was intended to guard against forgery,
and if it was not done such documents were
null and void. Waxen tablets were used
among the Romans for almost every species
of writing, where great length was not required.
Thus letters were frequently written
upon them, which were secured by being
fastened together with packthread and sealed
with wax. Legal documents, and especially
wills, were almost always written on waxen
tablets. Such tablets were also used for accounts,
in which a person entered what he
received and expended (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">codex
accepti et expensi</i>), whence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novae tabulae</i>
mean an abolition of debts either wholly or
in part. The tablets used in voting in the
comitia and the courts of justice were also
called tabulae, as well as tabellae. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tabella">Tabella</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Tabularii">TĂBŬLĀRĬI were notaries or accountants,
who are first mentioned under this name in
the time of the empire. Public notaries,
who had the charge of public documents,
were also called tabularii. They were first
established by M. Antoninus in the provinces,
who ordained that the births of all children
were to be announced to the tabularii within
thirty days from the birth.</p>


<p id="Tabularium">TĂBŬLĀRĬUM, a place where the public
records (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae publicae</i>) were kept. These
records were of various kinds, as for instance
senatusconsulta, tabulae censoriae, registers
of births, deaths, of the names of those who
assumed the toga virilis, &amp;c. There were
various tabularia at Rome, all of which were
in temples; we find mention made of tabularia
in the temples of the Nymphs, of
Lucina, of Juventus, of Libitina, of Ceres,
and more especially in that of Saturn, which
was also the public treasury.</p>


<p id="Tagus">TAGUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταγός</span>), a leader or general, was
more especially the name of the military
leader of the Thessalians. He is sometimes
called <em>king</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεύς</span>). His command was of
a military rather than of a civil nature, and
he seems only to have been appointed when
there was a war or one was apprehended.
We do not know the extent of the power
which the Tagus possessed constitutionally,
nor the time for which he held the office;
probably neither was precisely fixed, and depended
on the circumstances of the times
and the character of the individual.</p>

<p id="Talaria">TĀLĀRĬA, small wings, fixed to the ancles
of Hermes and reckoned among his attributes
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέδιλα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πτηνοπέδιλος</span>). In many works
of ancient art they are represented growing
from his ancles (see cut, <a href="#ill063">p. 63</a>); but more
frequently he is represented with sandals,
which have wings fastened to them on each
side over the ancles.</p>

<p id="Talassio">TĂLASSĬO. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Matrimonium">Matrimonium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Talentum">TĂLENTUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάλαντον</span>) meant originally
<em>a balance</em> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Libra">Libra</a></span>], then the substance
weighed, and lastly and commonly a certain
weight, <em>the talent</em>. The Greek system of
money, as well as the Roman [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As">As</a></span>], was
founded on a reference to weight. A certain
weight of silver among the Greeks, as
of copper among the Romans, was used as a
representative of a value, which was originally
and generally that of the metal itself.
The talent therefore and its divisions are
denominations of money as well as of weight.
The Greek system of weights contained four
principal denominations, which, though different
in different times and places, and even
at the same place for different substances,
always bore the same relation <em>to each other</em>.
These were the talent (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάλαντον</span>), which was
the largest, then the mina (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μνᾶ</span>), the drachma
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δραχμή</span>), and the obolus (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀβολός</span>). [See
<a href="#TABLES">Tables</a>.] The Attic and Aeginetan were the
two standards of money most in use in Greece.
The Attic mina was 4<em>l.</em> 1<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em>, and the talent
243<em>l.</em> 15<em>s.</em> The Aeginetan mina was 5<em>l.</em> 14<em>s.</em> 7<em>d.</em>,
and the talent 343<em>l.</em> 15<em>s.</em> The Euboic talent
was of nearly the same weight as the Attic.
A much smaller talent was in use for gold.
It was equal to six Attic drachmae, or about
¾ oz. and 71 grs. It was called the <em>gold
talent</em>, or the <em>Sicilian talent</em>, from its being
much used by the Greeks of Italy and Sicily.
This is the talent always meant when the
word occurs in Homer. This small talent
explains the use of the term <em>great talent</em>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum talentum</i>), which we find in Latin
authors, for the silver Attic talent was <em>great</em>
in comparison with this. But the use of the
word by the Romans is altogether very inexact.
Where talents are mentioned in the
classical writers without any specification of
the standard, we must generally understand
the Attic.</p>


<p id="Talio">TĀLĬO, from Talis, signifies an equivalent,
but it is used only in the sense of a punishment
or penalty the same in kind and degree
as the mischief which the guilty person has
done to the body of another. Talio, as a
punishment, was a part of the Mosaic law.</p>


<p id="Talus">TĀLUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀστράγαλος</span>), a huckle-bone. The
huckle-bones of sheep and goats were used
to play with from the earliest times, principally
by women and children, occasionally by
old men. To play at this game was sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πενταλιθίζειν</span>, because five bones
or other objects of a similar kind were employed;
and this number is retained among
ourselves. When the sides of the bone were
marked with different values, the game became
one of chance. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Alea">Alea</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Tessera">Tessera</a></span>.] The
two ends were left blank, because the bone
could not rest upon either of them on account
of its curvature. The four remaining sides
were marked with the numbers 1, 3, 4, 6;
1 and 6 being on two opposite sides, and
3 and 4 on the other two opposite sides.
The Greek and Latin names of the numbers
were as follows:&mdash;1. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μονάς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἶς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύων</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χῖος</span>;
Ion. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οἴνη</span>: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unio</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vulturius</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canis</i>: 3. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τρίας</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ternio</i>; 4. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τετράς</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quaternio</i>; 6. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑξάς</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑξίτης</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κῷος</span>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senio</i>. Two persons played together
at this game, using four bones, which they
threw up into the air, or emptied out of a
dice-box, and observing the numbers on the
uppermost sides. The numbers on the four
sides of the four bones admitted of thirty-five
different combinations. The lowest throw
of all was four aces (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jacere vultorios quatuor</i>).
But the value of a throw was not in
all cases the sum of the four numbers turned
up. The highest in value was that called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Venus</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jactus Venereus</i>, in which the
numbers cast up were all different, the sum
of them being only fourteen. It was by obtaining
this throw that the king of the feast
was appointed among the Romans [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Symposium">Symposium</a></span>],
and hence it was also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Basilicus</i>.
Certain other throws were called by particular
names, taken from gods, illustrious men
and women, and heroes. Thus the throw,
consisting of two aces and two trays, making
eight, which number, like the jactus Venereus,
could be obtained only once, was denominated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stesichorus</i>.</p>

<p id="Tamiae">TĂMĬAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμίαι</span>), the treasurers of the
temples and the revenue at Athens. The
wealthiest of all the temples at Athens was
that of Athena on the Acropolis, the treasures
of which were under the guardianship of ten
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tamiae</i>, who were chosen annually by lot
from the class of pentacosiomedimni, and
afterwards, when the distinction of classes
had ceased to exist, from among the wealthiest
of Athenian citizens. The treasurers of
the other gods were chosen in like manner;
but they, about the 90th Olympiad, were all
united into one board, while those of Athena
remained distinct. Their treasury, however,
was transferred to the same place as that of
Athena, viz., to the opisthodomus of the
Parthenon, where were kept not only all the
treasures belonging to the temples, but also
the state treasure (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὅσια χρήματα</span>, as contra-distinguished
from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερά</span>), under the care of
the treasurers of Athena. All the funds of
the state were considered as being in a manner
consecrated to Athena; while on the
other hand the people reserved to themselves
the right of making use of the sacred monies,
as well as the other property of the
temples, if the safety of the state should require
it. Payments made to the temples
were received by the treasurers in the presence
of some members of the senate, just as
public monies were by the Apodectae; and
then the treasurers became responsible for
their safe custody.&mdash;The treasurer of the
revenue (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμίας</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιμελητής τῆς κοινῆς
προσόδου</span>) was a more important personage
than those last mentioned. He was not a
mere keeper of monies, like them, nor a
mere receiver, like the apodectae; but a
general paymaster, who received through the
apodectae all money which was to be disbursed
for the purposes of the administration
(except the property-taxes, which were paid
into the war-office, and the tribute from the
allies, which was paid to the hellenotamiae
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Hellenotamiae">Hellenotamiae</a></span>]), and then distributed it in
such manner as he was required to do by the
law; the surplus (if any) he paid into the
war-office or the theoric fund. As this person
knew all the channels in which the
public money had to flow, and exercised a
general superintendence over the expenditure,
he was competent to give advice to the
people upon financial measures, with a view
to improve the revenue, introduce economy,
and prevent abuses; he is sometimes called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμίας τῆς διοικήσεως</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁ ἐπὶ τῆς διοικήσεως</span>,
and may be regarded as a sort of minister
of finance. He was elected by vote (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</span>),
and held his office for four years, but
was capable of being re-elected. A law,
however, was passed during the administration
of Lycurgus, the orator, prohibiting re-election;
so that Lycurgus, who is reported
to have continued in office for twelve years,
must have held it for the last eight years
under fictitious names. The power of this
officer was by no means free from control;
inasmuch as any individual was at liberty to
propose financial measures, or institute criminal
proceedings for malversation or waste of
the public funds; and there was an <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιγραφεὺς
τῆς διοικήσεως</span> appointed to check the
accounts of his superior. Anciently there
were persons called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poristae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πορίσται</span>), who
appear to have assisted the tamiae in some
part of their duties. The money disbursed
by the treasurer of the revenue was sometimes
paid directly to the various persons in
the employ of the government, sometimes
through subordinate pay offices. Many public
functionaries had their own paymasters,
who were dependent on the treasurer of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
revenue, receiving their funds from him,
and then distributing them in their respective
departments. Such were the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριηροποιοί</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τειχοποιοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁδοποιοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταφροποιοί</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπεμεληταὶ
νεωρίων</span>, who received through their
own tamiae such sums as they required from
time to time for the prosecution of their
works. The payment of the judicial fees
was made by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colacretae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κωλακρέται</span>),
which, and the providing for the meals in
the Prytaneium, were the only duties that
remained to them after the establishment of
the apodectae by Cleisthenes. The tamiae
of the sacred vessels (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τῆς Παράλου</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τῆς
Σαλαμινίας</span>) acted not only as treasurers, but
as trierarchs, the expenses (amounting for
the two ships together to about sixteen talents)
being provided by the state. They
were elected by vote. Other trierarchs had
their own private tamiae.&mdash;The war fund at
Athens (independently of the tribute) was
provided from two sources: first, the property-tax
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφορά</span>), and secondly, the surplus
of the yearly revenue, which remained
after defraying the expenses of the civil
administration. Of the ten strategi, who
were annually elected to preside over the
war department, one was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρατηγὸς ὁ
ἐπὶ τῆς διοικήσεως</span>, to whom the management
of the war fund was entrusted. He had
under him a treasurer, called the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμίας τῶν
στρατιωτικῶν</span>, who gave out the pay of the
troops, and defrayed all other expenses incident
to the service. So much of the surplus
revenue as was not required for the purposes
of war, was to be paid by the treasurer
of the revenue into the theoric fund; of
which, after the archonship of Euclides,
special managers were created. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Theorica">Theorica</a>.</span>]&mdash;Lastly,
we have to notice the treasurers of
the demi (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δήμων ταμίαι</span>), and those of the
tribes (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλῶν ταμίαι</span>), who had the care of
the funds belonging to their respective communities,
and performed duties analogous
to those of the state treasurers. The demi,
as well as the tribes, had their common lands,
which were usually let to farm. The rents of
these formed the principal part of their revenue.</p>


<p id="Taxiarchi">TAXIARCHI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταξίαρχοι</span>), military officers
at Athens, next in rank to the strategi.
They were ten in number, like the strategi,
one for each tribe, and were elected by vote
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</span>). In war each commanded the
infantry of his own tribe, and they were frequently
called to assist the strategi with their
advice at the war-council. In peace they
assisted the strategi in levying and enlisting
soldiers, and seem to have also assisted the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strategi</i> in the discharge of many of their
other duties. The taxiarchs were so called
from their commanding <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taxeis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάξεις</span>), which
were the principal divisions of the hoplites
in the Athenian army. Each tribe (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλή</span>)
formed a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taxis</i>. As there were ten tribes,
there were consequently in a complete Athenian
army ten <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taxeis</i>, but the number of men
contained in each would of course vary according
to the importance of the war. Among
the other Greeks, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taxis</i> was the name of
a much smaller division of troops. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lochus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λόχος</span>) among the Athenians was a
subdivision of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">taxis</i>, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lochagi</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοχαγοί</span>) were probably appointed by the
taxiarchs.</p>


<p id="Tegula">TĒGŬLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κέραμος</span>, <em>dim.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεραμίς</span>), a roofing-tile.
Roofing-tiles were originally made,
like bricks, of baked clay (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γῆς ὀπτῆς</span>). Byzes
of Naxos first introduced tiles of marble
about the year 620 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> A still more expensive
and magnificent method of roofing
consisted in the use of tiles made of bronze
and gilt. At Rome the houses were originally
roofed with shingles, and continued to
be so down to the time of the war with
Pyrrhus, when tiles began to supersede the
old roofing material.</p>


<p id="Teichopoii">TEICHŎPOII (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τειχοποιοί</span>), magistrates at
Athens, whose business it was to build and
keep in repair the public walls. They appear
to have been elected by vote (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χειροτονία</span>),
one from each tribe, and probably
for a year. Funds were put at their disposal,
for which they had their treasurer
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταμίας</span>) dependent on the treasurer of the
revenue. They were liable to render an
account (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐθύνη</span>) of their management of
these funds, and also of their general conduct,
like other magistrates. This office
has been invested with peculiar interest in
modern times, on account of its having been
held by Demosthenes, and its having given
occasion to the famous prosecution of Ctesiphon,
who proposed that Demosthenes should
receive the honour of a crown before he had
rendered his account according to law.</p>


<p id="Tela">TĒLA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστός</span>), a loom. Although weaving
was among the Greeks and Romans a
distinct trade, carried on by a separate class
of persons (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑφάνται</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">textores</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">textrices</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linteones</i>), yet every considerable domestic
establishment, especially in the country, contained
a loom, together with the whole apparatus
necessary for the working of wool
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lanificium</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ταλασία, ταλασιουργία</span>). [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Calathus">Calathus</a>.</span>]
These occupations were all supposed
to be carried on under the protection of
Athena or Minerva, specially denominated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ergane</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐργάνη</span>). When the farm or the
palace was sufficiently large to admit of it, a
portion of it called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">histon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστῶν</span>) or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">textrinum</i>
was devoted to this purpose. The
work was there principally carried on by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
female slaves (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasillariae</i>), under the superintendence
of the mistress of the house.
Every thing woven consists of two essential
parts, the warp and the woof, called in Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stamen</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subtegmen</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">subtemen</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trama</i>;
in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στήμων</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κροκή</span>. The warp was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stamen</i> in Latin (from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stare</i>) on account
of its erect posture in the loom. The
corresponding Greek term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στήμων</span>, and likewise
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστός</span>, have evidently the same derivation.
For the same reason, the very first
operation in weaving was to set up the loom
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱστὸν στήσασθαι</span>); and the web or cloth,
before it was cut down or “descended” from
the loom, was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestis pendens</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pendula
tela</i>, because it hung from the transverse
beam, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jugum</i>. These particulars
are all clearly exhibited in the picture of
Circe’s loom given in the annexed cut. We
observe in the preceding woodcut, about the
middle of the apparatus, a transverse rod
passing through the warp. A straight cane
was well adapted to be so used, and its application
is clearly expressed by Ovid in the
words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stamen secernit arundo</i>. In plain
weaving it was inserted between the threads
of the warp so as to divide them into two
portions, the threads on one side of the rod
alternating with those on the other side
throughout the whole breadth of the warp.
In a very ancient form of the loom there was
a roller underneath the jugum, turned by a
handle, and on which the web was wound as
the work advanced. The threads of the warp,
besides being separated by a transverse rod
or plank, were divided into thirty or forty parcels,
to each of which a stone was suspended for
the purpose of keeping the warp in a perpendicular
position, and allowing the necessary
play to the strokes of the spatha. Whilst
the comparatively coarse, strong, and much-twisted
thread designed for the warp was
thus arranged in parallel lines, the woof remained
upon the spindle [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Fusus">Fusus</a></span>], forming a
<em>spool</em>, <em>bobbin</em>, or <em>pen</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πήνη</span>). This was either
conveyed through the warp without any
additional contrivance, or it was made to
revolve in a shuttle (<em>radius</em>). This was
made of box brought from the shores of the
Euxine, and was pointed at its extremities,
that it might easily force its way through
the warp. All that is effected by the shuttle
is the conveyance of the woof across the
warp. To keep every thread of the woof in its
proper place, it is necessary that the threads
of the warp should be decussated. This was
done by the leashes, called in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">licia</i>, in
Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίτοι</span>. By a leash we are to understand
a thread having at one end a loop,
through which a thread of the warp was
passed, the other end being fastened to a
straight rod called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liciatorium</i>, and in Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κανών</span>. The warp, having been divided by
the arundo, as already mentioned, into two
sets of threads, all those of the same set were
passed through the loops of the corresponding
set of leashes, and all these leashes were
fastened at their other end to the same
wooden rod. At least one set of leashes was
necessary to decussate the warp, even in the
plainest and simplest weaving. The number
of sets was increased according to the complexity
of the pattern, which was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bilix</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trilix</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίμιτος, τρίμιτος</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πολύμιτος</span>,
according as the number was two,
three, or more. The process of annexing
the leashes to the warp was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordiri telam</i>,
also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">licia telae addere</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adnectere</i>. It
occupied two women at the same time, one
of whom took in regular succession each
separate thread of the warp, and handed it
over to the other (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραφέρειν</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραδίδοναι</span>, or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσφωρεῖσθαι</span>); the other, as she received
each thread, passed it through the loop in
proper order; an act which we call “entering,”
in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διάζεσθαι</span>. Supposing the warp
to have been thus adjusted, and the pen or
the shuttle to have been carried through it, it
was then decussated by drawing forwards the
proper rod, so as to carry one set of the threads
of the warp across the rest, after which the
woof was shot back again, and by the continual
repetition of this process the warp and
woof were interlaced. Two staves were occasionally
used to fix the rods in such a position
as was most convenient to assist the weaver
in drawing her woof across her warp. After
the woof had been conveyed by the shuttle
through the warp, it was driven sometimes
downwards, as is represented in the woodcut,
but more commonly upwards. Two different
instruments were used in this part of the process.
The simplest, and probably the most
ancient, was in the form of a large wooden
sword (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spatha</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σπάθη</span>). The spatha was, however,
in a great degree superseded by the comb
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecten</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κερκίς</span>), the teeth of which were inserted
between the threads of the warp, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
thus made by a forcible impulse to drive the
threads of the woof close together.&mdash;The lyre,
the favourite musical instrument of the
Greeks, was only known to the Romans as a
foreign invention. Hence they appear to
have described its parts by a comparison
with the loom, with which they were familiar.
The terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jugum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stamina</i> were
transferred by an obvious resemblance from
the latter to the former object; and, although
they adopted into their own language the
Greek word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plectrum</i>, they used the Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecten</i> to denote the same thing, not because
the instrument used in striking the lyre was
at all like a comb in shape and appearance,
but because it was held in the right
hand, and inserted between the stamina of
the lyre, as the comb was between the stamina
of the loom.</p>

<p id="Telamones">TĔLAMŌNES. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Atlantes">Atlantes</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Telones">TĔLŌNES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελώνης</span>), a farmer of the public
taxes at Athens. The taxes were let by
auction to the highest bidder. Companies
often took them in the name of one person,
who was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχώνης</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τελωνάρχης</span>, and
was their representative to the state. Sureties
were required of the farmer for the payment
of his dues. The office was frequently
undertaken by resident aliens, citizens not
liking it, on account of the vexatious proceedings
to which it often led. The farmer
was armed with considerable powers: he
carried with him his books, searched for contraband
or uncustomed goods, watched the
harbour, markets, and other places, to prevent
smuggling, or unlawful and clandestine
sales; brought a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phasis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φάσις</span>) or other legal
process against those whom he suspected of
defrauding the revenue; or even seized their
persons on some occasions, and took them
before the magistrate. To enable him to
perform these duties, he was exempted from
military service. Collectors (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐκλογεῖς</span>) were
sometimes employed by the farmers; but
frequently the farmer and the collector were
the same person. The taxes were let by the
commissioners (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πωλῆται</span>), acting under the
authority of the senate. The payments were
made by the farmer on stated prytaneias in
the senate-house. There was usually one
payment made in advance, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προκαταβολή</span>, and
one or more afterwards, called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσκατάβλημα</span>.
Upon any default of payment, the farmer
became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">atimus</i>, if a citizen, and he was liable
to be imprisoned at the discretion of the
court, upon an information laid against him.
If the debt was not paid by the expiration of
the ninth prytaneia, it was doubled; and if
not then paid, his property became forfeited
to the state, and proceedings to confiscation
might be taken forthwith. Upon this subject,
see the speech of Demosthenes against
Timocrates.</p>


<p id="Telos">TĔLOS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέλος</span>), a tax. The taxes imposed
by the Athenians, and collected at home, were
either ordinary or extraordinary. The former
constituted a regular or permanent source of
income; the latter were only raised in time
of war or other emergency. The ordinary
taxes were laid mostly upon <em>property</em>, and
upon citizens <em>indirectly</em>, in the shape of toll
or customs; though the resident aliens paid
a poll-tax (called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μετοίκιον</span>), for the liberty of
residing at Athens under protection of the
state. There was a duty of two per cent.
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεντηκοστή</span>), levied upon all exports and imports.
An excise was paid on all sales in
the market (called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπωνία</span>), though we know
not what the amount was. Slave-owners
paid a duty of three obols for every slave they
kept; and slaves who had been emancipated
paid the same. This was a very productive
tax before the fortification of Deceleia by the
Lacedaemonians. The justice fees (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρυτανεῖα</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραστασις</span>, &amp;c.) were a lucrative tax in time
of peace. The extraordinary taxes were the
property-tax, and the compulsory services
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liturgies</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λειτουργίαι</span>). Some of these
last were regular, and recurred annually;
the most important, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trierarchia</i>, was a
war-service, and performed as occasion required.
As these services were all performed,
wholly or partly, at the expense of the individual,
they may be regarded as a species of
tax. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Eisphora">Eisphora</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Leiturgia">Leitourgia</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Trierarchia">Trierarchia</a></span>.]
The tribute (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φόρος</span>) paid by the allied states
to the Athenians formed, in the flourishing
period of the republic, a regular and most
important source of revenue. In Olymp. 91
2, the Athenians substituted for the tribute a
duty of five per cent. (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰκοστή</span>) on all commodities
exported or imported by the subject
states, thinking to raise by this means a
larger income than by direct taxation. This
was terminated by the issue of the Peloponnesian
war, though the tribute was afterwards
revived, on more equitable principles,
under the name of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνταξις</span>. Other sources
of revenue were derived by the Athenians
from their mines and public lands, fines, and
confiscations. The public demesne lands,
whether pasture or arable, houses or other
buildings, were usually let by auction to private
persons. The conditions of the lease
were engraven on stone. The rent was payable
by prytaneias. These various sources of
revenue produced, according to Aristophanes,
an annual income of two thousand talents in
the most flourishing period of Athenian empire.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τελεῖν</span> signifies “to settle, complete, or
perfect,” and hence “to settle an account,”
and generally “to pay.” Thus <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Τέλος</span> comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
to mean any payment in the nature of a tax
or duty. The words are connected with
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">zahlen</i> in German, and the old sense of <em>tale</em>
in English, and the modern word <em>toll</em>. Though
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέλος</span> may signify any payment in the nature
of a tax or duty, it is more commonly used of
the ordinary taxes, as customs, &amp;c. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰσοτέλεια</span>
signifies the right of being taxed on the same
footing, and having other privileges, the same
as the citizens; a right sometimes granted to
resident aliens. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀτέλεια</span> signifies an exemption
from taxes, or other duties and services; an
honour very rarely granted by the Athenians.
As to the farming of the taxes, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Telones">Telones</a></span>.</p>


<p id="Templum">TEMPLUM is the same word as the Greek
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Temenos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέμενος</span>, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέμνω</span>, to cut off); for
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum</i> was any place which was circumscribed
and separated by the augurs from the
rest of the land by a certain solemn formula.
The technical terms for this act of the augurs
are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liberare</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">effari</i>, and hence a templum
itself is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus liberatus et effatus</i>. A place
thus set apart and hallowed by the augurs
was always intended to serve religious purposes,
but chiefly for taking the auguries.
The place in the heavens within which the
observations were to be made was likewise
called templum, as it was marked out and
separated from the rest by the staff of the
augur. When the augur had defined the
templum within which he intended to make
his observations, he fixed his tent in it (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabernaculum
capere</i>), and this tent was likewise
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum</i>, or, more accurately, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum
minus</i>. The place chosen for a templum was
generally an eminence, and in the city it was
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arx</i>, where the fixing of a tent does not
appear to have been necessary, because here
a place called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auguraculum</i> was once for all
consecrated for this purpose. Besides this
meaning of the word templum in the language
of the augurs, it also had that of a temple
in the common acceptation. In this case,
however, the sacred precinct within which a
temple was built, was always a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus liberatus
et effatus</i> by the augurs, that is, a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">templum</i> or
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fanum</i>; the consecration was completed by
the pontiffs, and not until inauguration and
consecration had taken place, could sacra be
performed or meetings of the senate be held
in it. It was necessary then for a temple to
be sanctioned by the gods, whose will was
ascertained by the augurs, and to be consecrated
or dedicated by the will of man (pontiffs).
Where the sanction of the gods had
not been obtained, and where the mere act of
man had consecrated a place to the gods, such
a place was only a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacrum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacrarium</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacellum</i>. The ceremony performed by the
augurs was essential to a temple, as the consecration
by the pontiffs took place also in
other sanctuaries which were not templa, but
mere <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sacra</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aedes sacrae</i>. Thus the sanctuary
of Vesta was not a templum, but an
aedes sacra, and the various curiae (Hostilia,
Pompeia, Julia) required to be made templa
by the augurs before senatusconsulta could be
made in them. It is impossible to determine
with certainty in what respects a templum
differed from a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">delubrum</i>.&mdash;Temples appear to
have existed in Greece from the earliest
times. They were separated from the profane
land around them (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τόπος βέβηλος</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὰ
βέβηλα</span>), because every one was allowed to
walk in the latter. This separation was in
early times indicated by very simple means,
such as a string or a rope. Subsequently,
however, they were surrounded by more efficient
fences, or even by a wall (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕρκος, περίβολος</span>).
The whole space enclosed in such a
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περίβολος</span> was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέμενος</span>, or sometimes
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱερόν</span>; and contained, besides the temple
itself, other sacred buildings, and sacred
ground planted with groves, &amp;c. Within
the precincts of the sacred enclosure no
dead were generally allowed to be buried,
though there were some exceptions to this
rule, and we have instances of persons being
buried in or at least near certain temples.
The religious laws of the island of Delos did
not allow any corpses to be buried within the
whole extent of the island, and when this
law had been violated, a part of the island
was first purified by Pisistratus, and subsequently
the whole island by the Athenian
people. The temple itself was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναός</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεώς</span>, and at its entrance fonts (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιῤῥαντήρια</span>)
were generally placed, that those who entered
the sanctuary to pray or to offer sacrifices
might first purify themselves. The act of
consecration, by which a temple was dedicated
to a god, was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἵδρυσις</span>. The character
of the early Greek temples was dark
and mysterious, for they had no windows,
and they received light only through the
door, which was very large, or from lamps
burning in them. Architecture in the construction
of magnificent temples, however,
made great progress even at an earlier time
than either painting or statuary, and long
before the Persian wars we hear of temples of
extraordinary grandeur and beauty. All
temples were built either in an oblong or
round form, and were mostly adorned with
columns. Those of an oblong form had
columns either in the front alone, in the fore
and back fronts, or on all the four sides.
Respecting the original use of these porticoes
see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Porticus">Porticus</a></span>. The friezes and metopes were
adorned with various sculptures, and no expense
was spared in embellishing the abodes
of the gods. The light, which was formerly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
let in at the door, was now frequently let in
from above through an opening in the middle.
Most of the great temples consisted of three
parts: 1. the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόναος</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόδομος</span>, the vestibule;
2. the cella (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ναός</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σηκός</span>); and 3. the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπισθόδομος</span>. The cella was the most important
part, as it was, properly speaking, the temple
or the habitation of the deity whose statue
it contained. In one and the same cella
there were sometimes the statues of two or
more divinities, as in the Erechtheum at
Athens, the statues of Poseidon, Hephaestus,
and Butas. The statues always faced the entrance,
which was in the centre of the prostylus.
The place where the statue stood was
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕδος</span>, and was surrounded by a balustrade
or railings. Some temples also had
more than one cella, in which case the one
was generally behind the other, as in the
temple of Athena Polias at Athens. In temples
where oracles were given, or where the
worship was connected with mysteries, the
cella was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄδυτον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέγαρον</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκτορον</span>,
and to it only the priests and the initiated
had access. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀπισθόδομος</span> was a building
which was sometimes attached to the back
front of a temple, and served as a place in
which the treasures of the temple were kept,
and thus supplied the place of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θησαυροί</span>,
which were attached to some temples.&mdash;<em>Quadrangular
Temples</em> were described by the following
terms, according to the number and
arrangement of the columns on the fronts
and sides. 1. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἄστυλος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">astyle</i>, without any
columns. 2. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἐν παραστάσι</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in antis</i>, with
two columns in front between the antae. 3.
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πρόστυλος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prostyle</i>, with four columns in
front. 4. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀμφιπρόστυλος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amphiprostyle</i>, with
four columns at each end. 5. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Περίπτερος</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀμφικίων</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peripteral</i>, with columns at each
end and along each side. 6. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δίπτερος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dipteral</i>,
with two ranges of columns (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πτερά</span>) all
round, the one within the other. 7. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ψευδοδίπτερος</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pseudodipteral</i>, with one range only,
but at the same distance from the walls of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i> as the outer range of a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δίπτερος</span>. To
these must be added a sort of sham invented
by the Roman architects, namely: 8. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ψευδοπερίπτερος</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pseudoperipteral</i>, where the sides
had only half-columns (at the angles three-quarter
columns), attached to the walls of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i>, the object being to have the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella</i> large
without enlarging the whole building, and
yet to keep up something of the splendour of
a peripteral temple. Names were also applied
to the temples, as well as to the porticoes
themselves, according to the number of
columns in the portico at either end of the
temple: namely, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετράστυλος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tetrastyle</i>, when
there were <em>four</em> columns in front, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑξάστυλος</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hexastyle</i>, when there were <em>six</em>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀκτάστυλος</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">octastyle</i>, when there were <em>eight</em>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δεκάστυλος</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">decastyle</i>, when there were <em>ten</em>. There were
never more than ten columns in the end portico
of a temple; and when there were only
two, they were always arranged in that peculiar
form called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in antis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐν παραστάσι</span>). The
number of columns in the end porticoes was
never uneven, but the number along the
sides of a temple was generally uneven. The
number of the side columns varied: where
the end portico was tetrastyle, there were
never any columns at the sides, except false
ones, attached to the walls: where it was
hexastyle or octastyle, there were generally
13 or 17 columns at the sides, counting in
the corner columns: sometimes a hexastyle
temple had only eleven columns on the sides.
The last arrangement resulted from the rule
adopted by the Roman architects, who counted
by intercolumniations (the spaces between
the columns), and whose rule was to have <em>twice
as many intercolumniations along the sides of
the building as in front</em>. The Greek architects
on the contrary, counted by columns, and
their rule was to have <em>twice as many columns
along the sides as in front, and one more</em>,
counting the corner columns in each case.
Another set of terms, applied to temples and
other buildings having porticoes, as well as
to the porticoes themselves, was derived from
the distances between the columns as compared
with the lower diameters of the columns.
They were the following:&mdash;1. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πυκνόστυλος</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pycnostyle</i>, the distance between the
columns a diameter of a column and half a
diameter. 2. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σύστυλος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">systyle</i>, the distance
between the columns two diameters of a
column. 3. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Εὔστυλος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eustyle</i>, the distance

<p>Independently of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
immense treasures contained in many of the
Greek temples, which were either utensils or
ornaments, and of the tithes of spoils, &amp;c.,
the property of temples, from which they derived
a regular income, consisted of lands
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τεμένη</span>), either fields, pastures, or forests.
These lands were generally let out to farm,
unless they were, by some curse which lay
on them, prevented from being taken into
cultivation. Respecting the persons entrusted
with the superintendence, keeping,
cleaning, &amp;c., see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Aeditui">Aeditui</a></span>. In the earliest
times there appear to have been very few
temples at Rome, and on many spots the
worship of a certain divinity had been established
from time immemorial, while we hear
of the building of a temple for the same divinity
at a comparatively late period. Thus
the foundation of a temple to the old Italian
divinity Saturnus, on the Capitoline, did not
take place till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 498. In the same manner,
Quirinus and Mars had temples built to them
at a late period. Jupiter also had no temple
till the time of Ancus Martius, and the one
then built was certainly very insignificant.
We may therefore suppose that the places of
worship among the earliest Romans were in
most cases simple altars or sacella. The
Roman temples of later times were constructed
in the Greek style. As regards the
property of temples, it is stated that in early
times lands were assigned to each temple,
but these lands were probably intended for
the maintenance of the priests alone. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Sacerdos">Sacerdos</a>.</span>]
The supreme superintendence of the
temples of Rome, and of all things connected
with them, belonged to the college of pontiffs.
Those persons who had the immediate care of
the temples were the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Aeditui">Aeditui</a></span>.</p>

<p id="Terminalia">TERMĬNĀLĬA, a festival in honour of the
god Terminus, who presided over boundaries.
His statue was merely a stone or post stuck
in the ground to distinguish between properties.
On the festival the two owners of
adjacent property crowned the statue with
garlands, and raised a rude altar, on which
they offered up some corn, honeycombs, and
wine, and sacrificed a lamb or a sucking-pig.
They concluded with singing the praises of
the god. The public festival in honour of
this god was celebrated at the sixth mile-stone
on the road towards Laurentum, doubtless
because this was originally the extent of
the Roman territory in that direction. The
festival of the Terminalia was celebrated on
the 23rd of February, on the day before the
Regifugium. The Terminalia was celebrated
on the last day of the old Roman
year, whence some derive its name. We
know that February was the last month of the
Roman year, and that when the intercalary
month Mercedonius was added, the last five
days of February were added to the intercalary
month, making the 23rd of February the
last day of the year.</p>


<p id="Teruncius">TĔRUNCĬUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As_c">As</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Tessera">TESSĔRA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κύβος</span>), a square or cube; a
die; a token. The dice used in games of
chance were tesserae, small squares or cubes,
and were commonly made of ivory, bone, or
wood. They were numbered on all the six
sides, like the dice still in use; and in this
respect as well as in their form they differed
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tali</i>. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Talus">Talus</a>.</span>] Whilst four tali were
used in playing, only three tesserae were anciently
employed. Objects of the same materials
with dice, and either formed like
them, or of an oblong shape, were used as
tokens for different purposes. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera
hospitalis</i> was the token of mutual hospitality,
and is spoken of under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Hospitium">Hospitium</a></span>.
This token was probably in many cases of
earthenware, having the head of Jupiter
Hospitalis stamped upon it. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tesserae frumentariae</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummariae</i> were tokens given
at certain times by the Roman magistrates
to the poor, in exchange for which they received
a fixed amount of corn or money.
From the application of this term to tokens
of various kinds, it was transferred to <em>the
word</em> used as a token among soldiers. This
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tessera militaris</i>, the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σύνθημα</span> of the
Greeks. Before joining battle it was given
out and passed through the ranks, as a method
by which the soldiers might be able to
distinguish friends from foes.</p>


<p id="Testamentum">TESTĀMENTUM, a will. In order to be
able to make a valid Roman will, the Testator
must have the Testamentifactio, which
term expresses the legal capacity to make a
valid will. The testamentifactio was the privilege
only of Roman citizens who were patresfamilias.
The following persons consequently
had not the testamentifactio: those
who were in the Potestas or Manus of another,
or in Mancipii causa, as sons and
daughters, wives In manu and slaves: Latini
Juniani, Dediticii: Peregrini could not
dispose of their property according to the
form of a Roman will: an Impubes could
not dispose of his property by will even with
the consent of his Tutor; when a male was
fourteen years of age, he obtained the testamentifactio,
and a female obtained the power,
subject to certain restraints, on the completion
of her twelfth year: muti, surdi, furiosi,
and prodigi “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quibus lege bonis interdictum
est</span>” had not the testamentifactio. In order
to constitute a valid will, it was necessary
that a heres should be instituted, which
might be done in such terms as follow:&mdash;Titius<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
heres esto, Titium heredem esse jubeo.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Heres">Heres</a></span> (<span class="smcap">Roman.</span>)] Originally there were
two modes of making wills; either at Calata
Comitia, which were appointed twice a year
for that purpose; or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in procinctu</i>, that is,
when a man was going to battle. A third
mode of making wills was introduced, which
was effected <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per aes et libram</i>, whence the
name of Testamentum per aes et libram. If
a man had neither made his will at Calata
Comitia nor In procinctu, and was in imminent
danger of death, he would mancipate
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mancipio dabat</i>) his Familia, that is, his
Patrimonium to a friend and would tell him
what he wished to be given to each after his
death. There seems to have been no rule of
law that a testament must be written. The
heres might either be made by oral declaration
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuncupatio</i>) or by writing. Written
wills however were the common form among
the Romans at least in the later republican
and in the imperial periods. They were
written on tablets of wood or wax, whence
the word “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cera</span>” is often used as equivalent
to “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabella</span>;” and the expressions prima,
secunda cera are equivalent to prima, secunda
pagina. The will must have been in
some way so marked as to be recognized, and
the practice of the witnesses (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testes</i>) sealing
and signing the will at last became common.
It was necessary for the witnesses both to
seal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signare</i>), that is, to make a mark with
a ring (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annulus</i>) or something else on the
wax and to add their names (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adscribere</i>).
Wills were to be tied with a triple thread
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linum</i>) on the upper part of the margin
which was to be perforated at the middle
part, and the wax was to be put over the
thread and sealed. Tabulae which were produced
in any other way had no validity.
A man might make several copies of his will,
which was often done for the sake of caution.
When sealed, it was deposited with some
friend, or in a temple, or with the Vestal
Virgins; and after the testator’s death it
was opened (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">resignare</i>) in due form. The
witnesses or the major part were present,
and after they had acknowledged their seals,
the thread (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">linum</i>) was broken and the will
was opened and read, and a copy was made;
the original was then sealed with the public
seal and placed in the archium, whence a
fresh copy might be got, if the first copy
should ever be lost.</p>

<p id="Testudo">TESTŪDO (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χελώνη</span>), a tortoise, was the
name given to several other objects.&mdash;(1) To
the Lyra, because it was sometimes made of
a tortoise-shell.&mdash;(2) To an arched or vaulted
roof.&mdash;(3) To a military machine moving
upon wheels and roofed over, used in besieging
cities, under which the soldiers
worked in undermining the walls or otherwise
destroying them. It was usually covered
with raw hides, or other materials which
could not easily be set on fire. The battering-ram
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aries">Aries</a></span>] was frequently placed under
a testudo of this kind, which was then called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Testudo Arietaria</i>.&mdash;(4) The name of testudo
was also applied to the covering made by a
close body of soldiers who placed their shields
over their heads to secure themselves against
the darts of the enemy. The shields fitted so
closely together as to present one unbroken
surface without any interstices between them,
and were also so firm that men could walk
upon them, and even horses and chariots be
driven over them. A testudo was formed
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testudinem facere</i>) either in battle to ward
off the arrows and other missiles of the enemy,
or, which was more frequently the case,
to form a protection to the soldiers when
they advanced to the walls or gates of a town
for the purpose of attacking them. Sometimes
the shields were disposed in such a
way as to make the testudo slope. The soldiers
in the first line stood upright, those in
the second stooped a little, and each line successively
was a little lower than the preceding
down to the last, where the soldiers
rested on one knee. Such a disposition of
the shields was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fastigata testudo</i>, on
account of their sloping like the roof of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
building. The advantages of this plan were
obvious: the stones and missiles thrown upon
the shields rolled off them like water from a
roof; besides which, other soldiers frequently
advanced upon them to attack the enemy upon
the walls. The Romans were accustomed
to form this kind of testudo, as an exercise,
in the games of the circus.</p>

<p id="Tetrarches">TĔTRARCHĒS or TĔTRARCHA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετράρχης</span>).
This word was originally used, according
to its etymological meaning, to signify the governor
of the fourth part of a country (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετραρχία</span>
or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετραδαρχία</span>). We have an example
in the ancient division of Thessaly into four
tetrarchies, which was revived by Philip.
Each of the three Gallic tribes which settled
in Galatia was divided into four tetrarchies,
each ruled by a tetrarch. Some of the tribes
of Syria were ruled by tetrarchs, and several
of the princes of the house of Herod ruled in
Palestine with this title. In the later period
of the republic and under the empire, the
Romans seem to have used the title (as also
those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ethnarch</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phylarch</i>) to designate
those tributary princes who were
not of sufficient importance to be called
kings.</p>


<p id="Tettarakonta">TETTĂRĂKONTA, HOI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἱ τετταράκοντα</span>),
<em>the Forty</em>, were certain officers chosen
by lot, who made regular circuits through the
demi of Attica, whence they are called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δικασταὶ
κατὰ δήμους</span>, to decide all cases of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰκία</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὰ
περὶ τῶν βιαίων</span>, and also all other private
causes, where the matter in dispute was not
above the value of ten drachmae. Their
number was originally thirty, but was increased
to forty after the expulsion of the
thirty tyrants, and the restoration of the democracy
by Thrasybulus, in consequence, it
is said, of the hatred of the Athenians to the
number of thirty.</p>


<p id="Thargelia">THARGĒLĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θαργήλια</span>), a festival celebrated
at Athens on the 6th and 7th of Thargelion,
in honour of Apollo and Artemis.
The real festival, or the Thargelia in a narrower
sense of the word, appears to have
taken place on the 7th; and on the preceding
day, the city of Athens or rather its
inhabitants were purified. The manner in
which this purification was effected is very
extraordinary, and is certainly a remnant of
very ancient rites, for two persons were put
to death on that day, and the one died on
behalf of the men and the other on behalf of
the women of Athens. The name by which
these victims were designated was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pharmaci</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φαρμακοί</span>). It appears probable, however,
that this sacrifice did not take place annually,
but only in case of a heavy calamity having
befallen the city, such as the plague, a famine,
&amp;c. The victims appear to have been
criminals sentenced to death. The second
day of the thargelia was solemnized with a
procession and an agon, which consisted of a
cyclic chorus, performed by men at the expense
of a choragus. The prize of the victor in
this agon was a tripod, which he had to dedicate
in the temple of Apollo which had
been built by Pisistratus. On this day it
was customary for persons who were adopted
into a family to be solemnly registered, and
received into the genos and the phratria of
the adoptive parents. This solemnity was
the same as that of registering one’s own
children at the Apaturia.</p>

  <div class="caption">Plan of Greek Theatre.</div>
</div>

<p id="Theatrum">THĔĀTRUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέατρον</span>), a theatre. The
Athenians before the time of Aeschylus had
only a wooden scaffolding on which their
dramas were performed. Such a wooden
theatre was only erected for the time of the
Dionysiac festivals, and was afterwards pulled
down. The first drama that Aeschylus brought
upon the stage was performed upon such a
wooden scaffold, and it is recorded as a singular
and ominous coincidence that on that
occasion (500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) the scaffolding broke
down. To prevent the recurrence of such an
accident, the building of a stone theatre was
forthwith commenced on the south-eastern
descent of the Acropolis, in the Lenaea;
for it should be observed, that throughout
Greece theatres were always built upon eminences,
or on the sloping side of a hill.
The new Athenian theatre was built on a
very large scale, and appears to have been
constructed with great skill in regard to
its acoustic and perspective arrangements.
Subsequently theatres were erected in all
parts of Greece and Asia Minor, although
Athens was the centre of the Greek drama,
and the only place which produced great
masterworks in this department of literature.
All the theatres, however, which were constructed
in Greece were probably built after
the model of that of Athens, and, with slight
deviations and modifications, they all resembled
one another in the main points, as
is seen in the numerous ruins of theatres in
various parts of Greece, Asia Minor, and
Sicily. The Attic theatre was, like all the
Greek theatres, placed in such a manner that
the place for the spectators formed the upper
or north-western, and the stage with all that
belonged to it the south-eastern part, and
between these two parts lay the orchestra.
The annexed plan has been made from the
remains of Greek theatres still extant, and
from a careful examination of the passages
in ancient writers which describe the whole
or parts of a theatre.&mdash;1. The place for the
spectators was in a narrower sense of the
word called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">theatrum</i>. The seats for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
spectators, which were in most cases cut out
of the rock, consisted of rows of benches
rising one above another; the rows themselves
(<em>a</em>) formed parts (nearly three-fourths)
of concentric circles, and were at intervals
divided into compartments by one or more
broad passages (<em>b</em>) running between them,
and parallel with the benches. These passages
were called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διαζώματα</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατατομαί</span>,
Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praecinctiones</i>, and when the concourse
of people was very great in a theatre, many
persons might stand in them. Across the
rows of benches ran stairs, by which persons
might ascend from the lowest to the highest.
But these stairs ran in straight lines only
from one praecinctio to another; and the
stairs in the next series of rows were just
between the two stairs of the lower series of
benches. By this course of the stairs the
seats were divided into a number of compartments,
resembling cones from which the
tops are cut off; hence they were termed
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεοκίδες</span>, and in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cunei</i>. The whole of
the place for the spectators (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θέατρον</span>) was
sometimes designated by the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κοῖλον</span>,
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cavea</i>, it being in most cases a real
excavation of the rock. Above the highest
row of benches there rose a covered portico
(<em>c</em>), which of course far exceeded in height
the opposite buildings by which the stage
was surrounded, and appears to have also
contributed to increase the acoustic effect.
The entrances to the seats of the spectators
were partly underground, and led to the
lowest rows of benches, while the upper
rows must have been accessible from above.&mdash;2.
The orchestra (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀρχήστρα</span>) was a circular
level space extending in front of the spectators,
and somewhat below the lowest row of
benches. But it was not a complete circle,
one segment of it being appropriated to the
stage. The orchestra was the place for the
chorus, where it performed its evolutions
and dances, for which purpose it was covered
with boards. As the chorus was the element
out of which the drama arose, so the orchestra
was originally the most important
part of a theatre: it formed the centre
around which all the other parts of the
building were grouped. In the centre of
the circle of the orchestra was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thymele</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυμέλη</span>), that is, the altar of Dionysus (<em>d</em>),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
which was of coarse nearer to the stage than
to the seats of the spectators, the distance
from which was precisely the length of a
radius of the circle. In a wider sense the
orchestra also comprised the broad passages
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάροδοι</span>, <em>e</em>) on each side, between the projecting
wings of the stage and the seats of
the spectators, through which the chorus entered
the orchestra. The chorus generally
arranged itself in the space between the
thymele and the stage. The thymele itself
was of a square form, and was used for
various purposes, according to the nature of
the different plays, such as a funeral monument,
an altar, &amp;c. It was made of boards,
and surrounded on all sides with steps. It
thus stood upon a raised platform, which
was sometimes occupied by the leader of the
chorus, the flute-player, and the rhabdophori.
The orchestra as well as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">theatrum</i> lay
under the open sky; a roof is nowhere mentioned.&mdash;3.
The stage. Steps led from each
side of the orchestra to the stage, and by
them the chorus probably ascended the stage
whenever it took a real part in the action
itself. The back side of the stage was closed
by a wall called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scena</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκηνή</span>), from
which on each side a wing projected which
was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parascenium</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρασκήνιον</span>).
The whole depth of the stage was not very
great, as it only comprised a segment of the
circle of the orchestra. The whole space
from the scena to the orchestra was termed
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proscenium</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσκήνιον</span>), and was what
we should call the real stage. That part of
it which was nearest to the orchestra, and
where the actors stood when they spoke,
was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">logeium</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λογείον</span>), also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ocribas</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀκρίβας</span>), in Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pulpitum</i>, which was of
course raised above the orchestra, and probably
on a level with the thymele. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scena</i> was, as we have already stated, the
wall which closed the stage (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proscenium</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">logeium</i>) from behind. It represented a suitable
background, or the locality in which the
action was going on. Before the play began
it was covered with a curtain (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παραπέτασμα</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προσκήνιον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλαίαι</span>), Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aulaea</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">siparium</i>.
When the play began this curtain was let
down, and was rolled up on a roller underneath
the stage. The proscenium and logeium
were never concealed from the spectators.
As regards the scenery represented
on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scena</i>, it was different for tragedy,
comedy, and the satyric drama, and for each
of these kinds of poetry the scenery must
have been capable of various modifications,
according to the character of each individual
play; at least that this was the case with the
various tragedies, is evident from the scenes
described in the tragedies still extant. In
the latter however the back-ground (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scena</i>)
in most cases represented the front of a
palace with a door in the centre (<em>i</em>) which
was called the <em>royal door</em>. This palace
generally consisted of two stories, and upon
its flat roof there appears to have been some
elevated place from which persons might
observe what was going on at a distance.
The palace presented on each side a projecting
wing, each of which had its separate
entrance. These wings generally represented
the habitations of guests and visitors.
All the three doors must have been visible
to the spectators. The protagonistes always
entered the stage through the middle or
royal door, the deuteragonistes and tritagonistes
through those on the right and left
wings. In tragedies like the Prometheus,
the Persians, Philoctetes, Oedipus in Colonus,
and others, the back-ground did not
represent a palace. There are other pieces
again in which the scena must have been
changed in the course of the performance, as
in the Eumenides of Aeschylus and the Ajax
of Sophocles. The dramas of Euripides required
a great variety of scenery; and if in
addition to this we recollect that several
pieces were played in one day, it is manifest
that the mechanical parts of stage performance,
at least in the days of Euripides, must
have been brought to great perfection. The
scena in the satyric drama appears to have
always represented a woody district with
hills and grottos; in comedy the scena represented,
at least in later times, the fronts of
private dwellings or the habitations of slaves.
The art of scene-painting must have been
applied long before the time of Sophocles,
although Aristotle ascribes its introduction
to him. The whole of the cavea in the
Attic theatre must have contained about
50,000 spectators. The places for generals,
the archons, priests, foreign ambassadors,
and other distinguished persons, were in the
lowest rows of benches, and nearest to the
orchestra, and they appear to have been
sometimes covered with a sort of canopy.
The rows of benches above these were occupied
by the senate of 500, those next in
succession by the ephebi, and the rest by
the people of Athens. But it would seem
that they did not sit indiscriminately, but
that the better places were let at a higher
price than the others, and that no one had a
right to take a place for which he had not
paid. The usual fee for a place was two
obols, which was subsequently given to the
poorer classes by a law of Pericles. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Theorica">Theorica</a>.</span>]
Women were allowed to be present
during the performance of tragedies, but not
of comedies.&mdash;The Romans must have become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
acquainted with the theatres of the
Italian Greeks at an early period, whence
they erected their own theatres in similar
positions upon the sides of hills. This is
still clear from the ruins of very ancient
theatres at Tusculum and Faesulae. The
Romans themselves, however, did not possess
a regular stone theatre until a very late
period, and although dramatic representations
were very popular in earlier times, it
appears that a wooden stage was erected
when necessary, and was afterwards pulled
down again, and the plays of Plautus and
Terence were performed on such temporary
scaffoldings. In the mean while, many of
the neighbouring towns of Rome had their
stone theatres, as the introduction of Greek
customs and manners was less strongly
opposed in them than in the city of Rome
itself. Wooden theatres, adorned with the
most profuse magnificence, were erected at
Rome even during the last period of the
republic. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 55 Cn. Pompey built the
first stone theatre at Rome, near the Campus
Martius. It was of great beauty, and is
said to have been built after the model of
that of Mytilene; it contained 40,000 spectators.
The construction of a Roman theatre
resembled, on the whole, that of a Greek
one. The principal differences are, that
the seats of the spectators, which rose in
the form of an amphitheatre around the
orchestra, did not form more than a semicircle;
and that the whole of the orchestra
likewise formed only a semicircle, the diameter
of which formed the front line of the
stage. The Roman orchestra contained no
thymele, and was not destined for a chorus,
but contained the seats for senators and
other distinguished persons, such as foreign
ambassadors, which are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">primus subselliorum
ordo</i>. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 68 the tribune L.
Roscius Otho carried a law which regulated
the places in the theatre to be occupied by
the different classes of Roman citizens: it
enacted that fourteen ordines of benches
were to be assigned as seats to the equites.
Hence these quatuordecim ordines are sometimes
mentioned without any further addition,
as the honorary seats of the equites.
They were undoubtedly close behind the
seats of the senators and magistrates, and
thus consisted of the rows of benches immediately
behind the orchestra.</p>

<p id="Thensae">THENSAE or TENSAE, highly ornamented
sacred vehicles, which, in the solemn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
pomp of the Circensian games, conveyed the
statues of certain deities with all their decorations
to the pulvinaria, and after the
sports were over bore them back to their
shrines. We are ignorant of their precise
form. We know that they were drawn by
horses, and escorted (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deducere</i>) by the chief
senators in robes of state, who, along with
pueri patrimi [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Patrimi">Patrimi</a></span>], laid hold of the
bridles and traces, or perhaps assisted to
drag the carriage by means of thongs attached
for the purpose (and hence the proposed
derivation from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tendo</i>). So sacred
was this duty considered, that Augustus,
when labouring under sickness, deemed it
necessary to accompany the tensae in a litter.
If one of the horses knocked up, or the
driver took the reins in his left hand, it was
necessary to recommence the procession, and
for one of the attendant boys to let go the
thong, or to stumble, was profanation. The
only gods distinctly named as carried in
tensae are Jupiter and Minerva, though
others appear to have had the same honour
paid them.</p>


<p id="Theophania">THĔŎPHĂNĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεοφάνια</span>), a festival celebrated
at Delphi, on the occasion of which
the Delphians filled the huge silver crater
which had been presented to the Delphic god
by Croesus.</p>


<p id="Theoria">THĔŌRĬA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Theori">Theori</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Theorica">THĔŌRĬCA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωρικά</span>). Under this name
at Athens were comprised the monies expended
on festivals, sacrifices, and public
entertainments of various kinds; and also
monies distributed among the people in the
shape of largesses from the state. There
were, according to Xenophon, more festivals
at Athens than in all the rest of Greece. At
the most important of the public festivals,
such as the Dionysia, Panathenaea, Eleusinia,
Thargelia, and some others, there were not
only sacrifices, but processions, theatrical exhibitions,
gymnastic contests, and games,
celebrated with great splendour and at a
great expense. A portion of the expense was
defrayed by the individuals upon whom the
burden of the liturgies devolved; but a considerable,
and perhaps the larger, part was
defrayed by the public treasury. Demosthenes
complains, that more money was spent
on a single Panathenaic or Dionysiac festival
than on any military expedition. The religious
embassies to Delos and other places,
and especially those to the Olympian, Nemean,
Isthmian, and Pythian games, drew
largely upon the public exchequer, though a
part of the cost fell upon the wealthier
citizens who conducted them. The largesses
distributed among the people had their origin
at an early period, and in a measure
apparently harmless, though from a small
beginning they afterwards rose to a height
most injurious to the commonwealth. The
Attic drama used to be performed in a
wooden theatre, and the entrance was free to
all citizens who chose to go. It was found,
however, that the crushing to get in led to
much confusion and even danger. On one
occasion, about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 500, the wooden scaffolding
of the theatre fell down, and caused great
alarm. It was then determined that the
entrance should no longer be gratuitous.
The fee for a place was fixed at two obols,
which was paid to the lessee of the theatre,
(called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεατρώνης</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεατροπώλης</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιτέκτων</span>),
who undertook to keep it in repair, and constantly
ready for use, on condition of being
allowed to receive the profits. This payment
continued to be exacted after the stone
theatre was built. Pericles, to relieve the
poorer classes, passed a law which enabled
them to receive the price of admission from
the state; after which all those citizens who
were too poor to pay for their places applied
for the money in the public assembly, which
was then frequently held in the theatre. In
process of time this donation was extended to
other entertainments besides theatrical ones;
the sum of two oboli being given to each citizen
who attended; if the festival lasted two
days, four oboli; and if three, six oboli; but
not beyond. Hence all theoric largesses received
the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diobelia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διωβελία</span>). It is
calculated that from 25 to 30 talents were
spent upon them annually. So large an expenditure
of the public funds upon shows and
amusements absorbed the resources, which
were demanded for services of a more important
nature. By the ancient law, the
whole surplus of the annual revenue which
remained after the expense of the civil administration
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τὰ περίοντα χρήματα τῆς διοικήσεως</span>)
was to be carried to the military fund, and
applied to the defence of the commonwealth.
Since the time of Pericles various demagogues
had sprung up, who induced the people to
divert all that could be spared from the other
branches of civil expenditure into the theoric
fund, which at length swallowed up the whole
surplus, and the supplies needed for the purpose
of war or defence were left to depend
upon the extraordinary contributions, or property-tax
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσφοραί</span>). An attempt was made
by the demagogue Eubulus to perpetuate this
system. He passed a law, which made it a
capital offence to propose that the theoric
fund should be applied to military service.
The law of Eubulus was a source of great
embarrassment to Demosthenes, in the prosecution
of his schemes for the national defence;
and he seems at last, but not before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 339, to have succeeded in repealing it.
In the earlier times there was no person, or
board of persons, expressly appointed to
manage the theoric fund. The money thus
appropriated was disbursed by the Hellenotamiae.
After the anarchy, the largess system
having been restored by Agyrrhius, a
board of managers was appointed. They were
elected by show of hands at the period of the
great Dionysia, one from each tribe.</p>

<p id="Theori">THĔŌRI (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωροί</span>), persons sent on special
missions (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωρίαι</span>) to perform some religious
duty, as to consult an oracle, or to offer a
sacrifice, on behalf of the state. There were
among some of the Dorian states, as the Aeginetans,
Troezenians, Messenians, and Mantineans,
official priests called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Theori</i>, whose
duty it was to consult oracles, interpret the
responses, &amp;c., as among the Spartans there
were men called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pythii</i>, chosen by the kings
to consult the oracle at Delphi. At Athens
there were no official persons called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Theori</i>,
but the name was given to those citizens who
were appointed from time to time to conduct
religious embassies to various places; of
which the most important were those that
were sent to the Olympian, Pythian, Nemean,
and Isthmian games, those that went to consult
the God at Delphi, and those that led
the solemn procession to Delos, where the
Athenians established a quadriennial festival,
in revival of the ancient Ionian one, of which
Homer speaks. The expense of these embassies
was defrayed partly by the state, and
partly by wealthy citizens, to whom the management
of them was entrusted, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Architheori</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρχιθέωροι</span>), chiefs of the embassy.
This was a sort of liturgy, and frequently a
very costly one; as the chief conductor represented
the state, and was expected to
appear with a suitable degree of splendour;
for instance, to wear a golden crown, to drive
into the city with a handsome chariot, retinue,
&amp;c. The Salaminian, or Delian, ship
was also called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεωρὶς ναῦς</span>, and was principally
used for conveying embassies to Delos,
though, like the Paralus, it was employed on
other expeditions besides.</p>

<p id="Thesaurus">THĒSAURUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θησαυρός</span>), a treasure-house.
Tradition points to subterranean buildings in
Greece, of unknown antiquity and of peculiar
formation, as having been erected during
the heroic period, for the purpose of preserving
precious metals, arms, and other property
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κειμήλια</span>). Such are the treasury of
Minyas, at Orchomenus, of which some remains
still exist, and those of Atreus and
his sons at Mycenae, the chief one of which,
the so-called Treasury of Atreus, still exists
almost in a perfect state. It is, however,
very questionable whether these edifices were
treasuries at all: some of the best archaeologists
maintain that they were tombs. In
the historical times, the public treasury was
either in a building attached to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agora</i>, or in
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opisthodomus</i> of some temple. Respecting
the public treasury at Rome, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Aerarium">Aerarium</a></span>.</p>


<p id="Theseia">THĒSEIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θησεῖα</span>), a festival celebrated by
the Athenians in honour of their national
hero Theseus, whom they believed to have
been the author of their democratical form of
government. In consequence of this belief
donations of bread and meat were given to
the poor people at the Theseia, which was
thus for them a feast at which they felt no
want, and might fancy themselves equal to
the wealthiest citizens. The day on which
this festival was held was the eighth of every
month (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀγδόαι</span>), but more especially the eighth
of Pyanepsion, whence the festival was sometimes
called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὀγδόδιον</span>. It is probable that
the festival of the Theseia was not instituted
till <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 469, when Cimon brought the remains
of Theseus from Scyrus to Athens.</p>


<p id="Thesmophoria">THESMŎPHŎRĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεσμοφόρια</span>), a great
festival and mysteries, celebrated in honour
of Demeter in various parts of Greece, and
only by women, though some ceremonies
were also performed by maidens. It was
intended to commemorate the introduction of
the laws and regulations of civilised life,
which was universally ascribed to Demeter.
The Attic thesmophoria probably lasted only
three days, and began on the 11th of Pyanepsion,
which day was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄνοδος</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάθοδος</span>, because the solemnities were opened
by the women with a procession from Athens
to Eleusis. In this procession they carried
on their heads sacred laws (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νόμιμοι βίβλοι</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θεσμοί</span>), the introduction of which was ascribed
to Demeter (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θεσμοφόρος</span>), and other
symbols of civilised life. The women spent
the night at Eleusis in celebrating the mysteries
of the goddess. The second day, called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νηστεία</span>, was a day of mourning, during which
the women sat on the ground around the
statue of Demeter, and took no other food
than cakes made of sesame and honey. On
this day no meetings either of the senate or
the people were held. It was probably in the
afternoon of this day that the women held a
procession at Athens, in which they walked
barefooted behind a waggon, upon which
baskets with mystical symbols were conveyed
to the thesmophorion. The third day, called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καλλιγένεια</span>, from the circumstance that Demeter
was invoked under this name, was a
day of merriment and raillery among the
women themselves, in commemoration of
Iambe, who was said to have made the goddess
smile during her grief.</p>

at the top in a point, whatever might
be the purpose for which it was used. At
Athens the name was in particular applied
to the new round prytaneium near the senate-house,
which should not be confounded with
the old prytaneium at the foot of the acropolis.
It was therefore the place in which
the prytanes took their common meals and
offered their sacrifices. It was adorned with
some small silver statues, and near it stood
the ten statues of the Attic Eponymi.</p>

terminated by the apple of the pine, or fir-cone,
that tree (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πεύκη</span>) being dedicated to
Bacchus in consequence of the use of the
turpentine which flowed from it, and also
of its cones, in making wine. The monuments
of ancient art, however, most commonly
exhibit, instead of the pine-apple, a
bunch of vine or ivy-leaves, with grapes or
berries, arranged into the form of a cone.
The fabulous history of Bacchus relates that
he converted the thyrsi carried by himself
and his followers into dangerous weapons,
by concealing an iron point in the head of
the leaves. Hence his thyrsus is called
“a spear enveloped in vine-leaves,” and its
point was thought to incite to madness.</p>

<p id="Tibia">TĪBĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλός</span>), a pipe, the commonest musical
instrument of the Greeks and Romans. It
was very frequently a hollow cane, perforated
with holes in the proper places. In other
instances it was made of some kind of wood,
especially box, and was bored with a gimblet.
When a single pipe was used by itself, the
performer upon it, as well as the instrument,
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monaulos</i>. Among the varieties
of the single pipe the most remarkable were
the bagpipe, the performer on which was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">utricularius</i> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσκαύλης</span>; and the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀυλὸς πλάγιος</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλαγίαυλος</span>, which, as its
name implies, had a mouth-piece inserted
into it at right angles. Pan was the reputed
inventor of this kind of tibia as well as of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fistula</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">syrinx</i> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Syrinx">Syrinx</a></span>]. But among
the Greeks and Romans it was much more
usual to play on two pipes at the same time.
Hence a performance on this instrument
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tibicinium</i>), even when executed by a single
person, was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canere</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cantare tibiis</i>.
This act is exhibited in very numerous works
of ancient art, and often in such a way as to
make it manifest that the two pipes were
perfectly distinct, and not connected, as some
have supposed, by a common mouth-piece.
The mouth-pieces of the two pipes often
passed through a capistrum. Three different
kinds of pipes were originally used to produce
music in the Dorian, Phrygian, and
Lydian modes. It appears, also, that to produce
the Phrygian mode the pipe had only
two holes above, and that it terminated in a
horn bending upwards. It thus approached
to the nature of a trumpet, and produced
slow, grave, and solemn tunes. The Lydian
mode was much quicker, and more varied
and animating. Horace mentions “Lydian
pipes” as a proper accompaniment, when he
is celebrating the praise of ancient heroes.
The Lydians themselves used this instrument
in leading their troops to battle; and the
pipes employed for the purpose are distinguished
by Herodotus as “male and female,”
i.e. probably bass and treble, corresponding
to the ordinary sexual difference in the human
voice. The corresponding Latin terms
are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tibia dextra</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sinistra</i>: the respective
instruments are supposed to have been so
called, because the former was more properly
held in the right hand and the latter in the
left. The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tibia <em>dextra</em></span>” was used to lead
or commence a piece of music, and the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sinistra</span>”
followed it as an accompaniment.
The comedies of Terence having been accompanied
by the pipe, the following notices
are prefixed to explain the kind of music
appropriate to each: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tibiis paribus</i>, i.e. with
pipes in the same mode; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tib. imparibus</i>,
pipes in different modes; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tib. duabus dextris</i>,
two pipes of low pitch; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tib. par. dextris et
sinistris</i>, pipes in the same mode, and of both
low and high pitch. The use of the pipe
among the Greeks and Romans was three-fold,
viz. at sacrifices (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tibiae sacrificae</i>), entertainments
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludicrae</i>), and funerals. The
pipe was not confined anciently, as it is with
us, to the male sex, but <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐλητρίδες</span>, or female
tibicines were very common.</p>

individual might respectively have sustained.
The penalty was either fixed by the judge,
or merely declared by him according to some
estimate made before the cause came into
court. In the first case the trial was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν τιμητὸς</span>, in the second case <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀγὼν ἀτίμητος</span>,
a distinction which applies to civil as
well as to criminal trials. Where a man
sought to recover an estate in land, or a
house, or any specific thing, as a ring, a
horse, a slave, nothing further was required,
than to determine to whom the estate, the
house, or the thing demanded, of right belonged.
The same would be the case in an
action of debt, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρέους δίκη</span>, where a sum certain
was demanded. In these and many
other similar cases the trial was <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀτίμητος</span>.
On the other hand, wherever the damages
were in their nature <em>unliquidated</em>, and no
provision had been made concerning them
either by the law or by the agreement of the
parties, they were to be assessed by the dicasts.
The following was the course of proceeding
in the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τιμητοὶ ἀγῶνες</span>. The bill of
indictment (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔγκλημα</span>) was always superscribed
with some penalty by the person who
preferred it. He was said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιγράφεσθαι
τίμημα</span>, and the penalty proposed is called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίγραμμα</span>. If the defendant was found
guilty, the prosecutor was called upon to
support the allegation in the indictment,
and for that purpose to mount the platform
and address the dicasts (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀναβαίνειν εἰς
τίμημα</span>). If the accused submitted to the
punishment proposed on the other side, there
was no further dispute; if he thought it too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
severe, he made a counter proposition.
He was then said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀντιτιμᾶσθαι</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἑαυτῷ τιμᾶσθαι</span>.
He was allowed to address the court
in mitigation of punishment. After both
parties had been heard, the dicasts were
called upon to give their verdict. Sometimes
the law expressly empowered the jury
to impose an additional penalty (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστίμημα</span>)
besides the ordinary one. Here the
proposition emanated from the jury themselves,
any one of whom might move that
the punishment allowed by the law should
be awarded. He was said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστιμᾶσθαι</span>,
and the whole dicasts, if (upon a division) they
adopted his proposal, were said <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">προστιμᾷν</span>.</p>

From their first enrolment the Roman soldiers,

the tirones twice, in the morning and afternoon,

their own ancient Sabine sacra. To superintend
and preserve these, T. Tatius is said
to have instituted the Titii sodales. During
the time of the republic the Titii sodales are
no longer mentioned, as the sacra of the
three tribes became gradually united into one
common religion. Under the empire we
again meet with a college of priests bearing
the name of Sodales Titii or Titienses, or Sacerdotes

<p id="Toga">TŎGA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τήβεννος</span>), a gown, the name of the
principal outer garment worn by the Romans,
seems to have been received by them from
the Etruscans. The toga was the peculiar
distinction of the Romans, who were thence
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">togati</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gens togata</i>. It was originally
worn only in Rome itself, and the
use of it was forbidden alike to exiles and to
foreigners. Gradually, however, it went out
of common use, and was supplanted by the
pallium and lacerna, or else it was worn in
public under the lacerna. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Lacerna">Lacerna</a>.</span>] But it
was still used by the upper classes, who regarded
it as an honourable distinction, in the
courts of justice, by clients when they received
the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Sportula">Sportula</a></span>, and in the theatre or
at the games, at least when the emperor
was present. The exact form of the toga,
and the manner of wearing it, have occasioned
much dispute; but the following account,
for which the writer is indebted to his
friend Mr. George Scharf, jun., will set these
matters in a clearer light than has hitherto
been the case. The complete arrangement of
this dress may be seen in many antique statues,
but especially in that of Didius Julianus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
in the Louvre, and a bronze figure of the elder
Drusus discovered at Herculaneum. (See

<p>The letters upon particular parts
of the illustrations correspond with each
other, and refer to the same places upon the
general form of the toga given above. The
method of adjusting the toga is simply this:
the straight edge (<em>a b g d</em>) being kept towards
the neck, and the rounded towards the hand,
the first part of the toga hangs in front over
the left shoulder to the ground (<em>a</em>, fig. 4), so
as to cover that entire half of the figure
viewed in front. The remainder falling behind
is wrapped round the body, being carried
<em>under</em> the right arm, and brought upwards,
like a belt, across the chest, covering
the left arm and shoulder for a second time.
It again falls behind, and terminates in the
point <em>d</em> (fig. 5), somewhat higher than the
front portion (<em>a</em>).</p>

Mode of putting on the Toga.</div>
</div>

<p>So far any mantle of sufficient
length might be folded, but two distinctive
features of Roman dress, the umbo
(<em>f</em>) and the sinus (<em>c e</em>), have yet to be considered.
The sinus (<em>c e</em>) is that upper hanging
portion with the curved edge downwards
which shows conspicuously upon the right
thigh. When the toga has been brought
round to the front of the right leg, it has
attained its greatest width (<em>e c e</em>), although
on the figure less space is required for it. It
is therefore folded over at the top, the upper
part falling forward, down almost to the
knee. It may be easily raised (see fig. 5)
and used as a lap&mdash;hence the name sinus&mdash;to
carry fruits and flowers, so often represented
in ancient art. The fold at <em>c</em> thus
becomes the upper edge, and forms the
balteus, which may be made still more
effective by being rolled round and slightly
twisted, as in figs. 2 and 5. A variety again
was sometimes produced by lifting the hanging
edge (<em>e</em>) of this sinus up on to the
shoulder, so as to cover the right arm with
that alone, and Quintilian hints that it is not
ungraceful to throw back the extreme edge
of that again, an effect still to be admired in
some of the ancient sculptures. Fig. 5 is in
the act of raising the edge. The umbo (<em>f</em>),
a projecting mass of folds in front of the
body, like the boss of a shield, was formed
<em>after</em> the rest of the dress had been put on
in a very simple manner: a part of the
front upright line (<em>a b</em>), almost covered up
by the adjustment of the upper shoulder portion
(<em>g</em>), was pulled out and made to hang
down over the balteus or belt-like part
(fig. 6). It is clearly traceable in both statues
here given (figs. 2 and 3), and fig. 4 is
intended to show the formation of the umbo
more clearly by the right hand holding the
edge, which falls over the fingers instead of
the balteus. In proportion as the umbo (<em>f</em>)
projects, so of course the end (<em>a</em>) is raised
from the ground. The smaller figures (4 and
5) are both drawn without under-garments
in order to avoid confusion. During sacrifice,
when necessary to cover the head, the
edge (<em>b</em>) nearest the neck was pulled up and
made to cover the head, as in fig. 3, where
the entire length of the edge, passing from
the umbo into the sinus, is very clearly
visible. The dress here is very ample, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
can spare an extra length, but in the statue
of a priest in the Louvre the head is covered
at the expense of the umbo, which has entirely
disappeared. Fig. 6 is intended to
show the interlacing and arrangement of the
toga by following the course of the straight
edge alone from <em>a</em> to <em>d</em>.</p>

<p>In many ancient statues
the sleeves and folds of the tunic, being
very full, are apt to be confounded with the
rest, but in the best style of art this is not
the case. Quintilian cautions his orators
against these incumbrances. A difference in
size and fulness of the toga, modified according
to the rank of the wearer, may be detected in
coins and sculpture, but in all cases the mode
of adjustment appears to be the same.&mdash;One
mode of wearing the toga was the Cinctus Gabinus.
It consisted in forming a part of the
toga itself into a girdle, by drawing its outer
edge round the body and tying it in a knot
in front, and at the same time covering the
head with another portion of the garment.
It was worn by persons offering sacrifices,
by the consul when he declared war, and by
devoted persons, as in the case of Decius.
Its origin was Etruscan, as its name implies.
Persons wearing this dress were said
to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">procincti</i> (or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incincti</i>) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinctu</i> (or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ritu</i>)
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gabino</i>.&mdash;The colour of the toga worn by
men (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga virilis</i>) was generally white, that
is, the natural colour of white wool. Hence
it was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pura</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestimentum purum</i>, in
opposition to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praetexta</i> mentioned below.
A brighter white was given to the toga of
candidates for offices (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">candidati</i> from their
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga candida</i>) by rubbing it with chalk.
There is an allusion to this custom in the
phrase <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cretata ambitio</i>. White togas are
often mentioned as worn at festivals, which
does not imply that they were not worn commonly,
but that new or fresh-cleaned togas
were first put on at festivals. The toga was
kept white and clean by the fuller. When
this was neglected, the toga was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordida</i>,
and those who wore such garments
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordidati</i>. This dress (with disarranged hair
and other marks of disorder about the person)
was worn by accused persons, as in the
case of Cicero. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga pulla</i>, which was
of the natural colour of black wool, was worn
in private mourning, and sometimes also by
artificers and others of the lower orders.&mdash;The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga picta</i>, which was ornamented with
Phrygian embroidery, was worn by generals
in triumphs [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Triumphus">Triumphus</a></span>], and under the
emperors by the consuls, and by the praetors
when they celebrated the games. It was
also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capitolina</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga palmata</i>
was a kind of toga picta.&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga praetexta</i>
had a broad purple border. It was worn
with the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Bulla">Bulla</a></span>, by children of both sexes.
It was also worn by magistrates, both those
of Rome, and those of the colonies and municipia;
by the sacerdotes, and by persons engaged
in sacred rites or paying vows. Among
those who possessed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus togae praetextae
habendae</i>, the following may be more particularly
mentioned: the dictator, the consuls,
the praetors (who laid aside the praetexta
when about to condemn a Roman citizen
to death), the augurs (who, however,
are supposed by some to have worn the trabea),
the decemviri sacris faciundis, the
aediles, the triumviri epulones, the senators
on festival days, the magistri collegii, and
the magistri vicorum when celebrating games.
In the case of the tribuni plebis, censors,
and quaestors, there is some doubt upon the
subject. The toga praetexta is said to have
been derived from the Etruscans, and to have
been first adopted, with the latus clavus
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Clavus_l">Clavus Latus</a></span>], by Tullus Hostilius as the
royal robe, whence its use by the magistrates
in the republic. The toga praetexta and the
bulla aurea were first given to boys in the
case of the son of Tarquinius Priscus, who,
at the age of fourteen, in the Sabine war,
slew an enemy with his own hand. Respecting
the leaving off of the toga praetexta,
and the assumption of the toga virilis, see
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Impubes">Impubes</a></span> and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Clavus_l">Clavus Latus</a></span>. The occasion
was celebrated with great rejoicings by the
friends of the youth, who attended him in a
solemn procession to the Forum and Capitol.
This assumption of the toga virilis was
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tirocinium fori</i>, as being the young
man’s introduction to public life. Girls wore
the praetexta till their marriage.&mdash;The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trabea</i>
was a toga ornamented with purple horizontal
stripes. There were three kinds of trabeae;
one wholly of purple, which was sacred
to the gods, another of purple and white,
and another of purple and saffron, which belonged
to augurs. The purple and white
trabea was a royal robe, and is assigned to
the Latin and early Roman kings, especially
to Romulus. It was worn by the consuls in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
public solemnities, such as opening the temple
of Janus. The equites wore it at the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">transvectio</i>, and in other public solemnities.
Hence the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trabea</i> is mentioned as the badge
of the equestrian order. Lastly, the toga
worn by the Roman emperors was wholly of
purple. It appears to have been first assumed
by Julius Caesar.&mdash;The material of
which the toga was commonly made was
wool. It was sometimes thick and sometimes
thin. The former was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga densa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinguis</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hirta</i>. A new toga, with the nap
neither worn off nor cut close, was called
pexa, to which is opposed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trita</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rasa</i>,
which was used as a summer dress. The
toga was originally worn by both sexes; but
when the stola came to be worn by matrons,
the toga was only worn by the meretrices, and
by women who had been divorced on account
of adultery. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Stola">Stola</a>.</span>] In war the toga was
laid aside, and replaced by the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Paludamentum">Paludamentum</a></span>
and <span class="smcap"><a href="#Sagum">Sagum</a></span>. Hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">togatus</i> is opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miles</i>.</p>

<p id="Tormentum">TORMENTUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀφετήρια ὄργανα</span>), a military
engine, so called from the twisting
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">torquendo</i>) of hairs, thongs, and vegetable
fibres. The principal military engines were
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balista</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">catapulta</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">balista</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πετροβόλος</span>) was used to shoot stones; the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">catapulta</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταπέλτης</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταπελτική</span>) to project
darts, especially the falarica [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Hasta">Hasta</a></span>], and a
kind of missile, 4½ feet long, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trifax</i>.
Whilst in besieging a city the ram [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aries">Aries</a></span>] was
employed in destroying the lower part of the
wall, the balista was used to overthrow the battlements
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">propugnacula</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπαλξεῖς</span>), and the catapult
to shoot any of the besieged who appeared
between them: the forms of these machines
being adapted to the objects which they were
intended to throw; the catapult was long, the
balista nearly square. Instances are recorded
in which the balista threw stones to the distance
of a quarter of a mile. Some balistae
threw stones weighing three hundredweight.
Of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scorpio</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">onager</i>, which was also a species

<p id="Tormentum_t">TORMENTUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βάσανος</span>), torture. (1)
<span class="smcap">Greek.</span>&mdash;By a decree of Scamandrius it was
ordained that no free Athenian could be put
to the torture, and this appears to have been
the general practice. The evidence of slaves
was, however, always taken with torture, and
their testimony was not otherwise received.
From this circumstance their testimony appears
to have been considered of more value
than that of freemen. Any person might
offer his own slave to be examined by torture,
or demand that of his adversary, and
the offer or demand was equally called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόκλησις εἰς βάσανον</span>. The parties interested
either superintended the torture themselves,
or chose certain persons for this purpose,
hence called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασανισταὶ</span>, who took the evidence
of the slaves. (2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span>&mdash;During the
time of the republic freemen were never put
to the torture, and slaves only were exposed
to this punishment. Slaves, moreover, could
not be tortured to prove the guilt of their
own master, except in the case of incestus,
which was a crime against the gods, or unless
the senate made an exception in some
special instance. At a later time slaves
might be tortured to bear witness against
their masters in cases of majestas and adultery.
Under the emperors even free persons
were put to the torture to extract evidence
from them in cases of majestas; and although
this indignity was confined for the most part
to persons in humble circumstances, we read
of cases in which even Roman senators and
equites were exposed to it.</p>

<p id="Tragoedia">TRĂGOEDIA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τραγῳδία</span>), tragedy. (1)
<span class="smcap">Greek.</span> The tragedy of the ancient Greeks
as well as their comedy confessedly originated
in the worship of the god Dionysus.
The peculiarity which most strikingly distinguishes
the Greek tragedy from that of
modern times, is the lyrical or choral part.
This was the offspring of the dithyrambic
and choral odes from which, as applied to
the worship of Dionysus, Greek tragedy took
its rise. The name of Tragedy (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τραγῳδία</span>)
is probably derived from the goatlike appearance
of the Satyrs who sang or acted with
mimetic gesticulations (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὄρχησις</span>) the old Bacchic
songs, with Silenus, the constant companion
of Dionysus, for their leader. The
Dionysian dithyrambs were sometimes of a
gay and at other times of a mournful character:
it was from the latter that the stately
and solemn tragedy of the Greeks arose.
Great improvements were introduced in the
dithyramb by Arion, a contemporary of Periander.
Before his time the dithyramb was
sung in a wild and irregular manner; but he
is said to have invented the Cyclic chorus,
by which we are to understand that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
Dithyramb was danced by a chorus of fifty
men round an altar. The choral Dithyrambic
songs prevailed to some extent, as all
choral poetry did, amongst the Dorians of
the Peloponnesus; whence the choral element
of the Attic tragedy was always written
in the Dorian dialect, thus showing its
origin. The lyrical poetry was, however,
especially popular at Sicyon and Corinth. In
the latter city Arion made his improvements;
in the former “tragic choruses,” i.e. dithyrambs
of a sad and plaintive character, were
very ancient. From the more solemn Dithyrambs
then, as improved by Arion, ultimately
sprang the dramatic tragedy of Athens, somewhat
in the following manner. The choruses
were under the direction of a leader
or exarchus, who, it may be supposed, came
forward separately, and whose part was
sometimes taken by the poet himself. We
may also conjecture that the exarchus in
each case led off by singing or reciting his
part in a solo, and that the chorus dancing
round the altar then expressed their feelings
of joy or sorrow at his story, representing
the perils and sufferings of Dionysus, or some
hero, as it might be. The subjects of this
Dithyrambic tragedy were not, however,
always confined to Dionysus. Even Arion
wrote Dithyrambs, relating to different
heroes, a practice in which he was followed
by succeeding poets. It is easy to conceive
how the introduction of an actor or speaker
independent of the chorus might have been
suggested by the exarchs coming forward
separately and making short off-hand speeches,
whether learnt by heart beforehand, or made
on the spur of the moment. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a>.</span>] But
it is also possible, if not probable, that it
was suggested by the rhapsodical recitations
of the epic and gnomic poets formerly prevalent
in Greece: the gnomic poetry being
generally written in Iambic verse, the metre
of the Attic dialogue. This however is certain,
that the union of the Iambic dialogue
with the lyrical chorus took place at Athens
under Pisistratus, and that it was attributed
to Thespis, a native of Icaria, one of the
country demes or parishes of Attica where
the worship of Dionysus had long prevailed.
The alteration made by him, and which gave
to the old tragedy a new and dramatic character,
was very simple but very important.
He introduced an actor, as it is recorded, for
the sake of giving rest to the chorus, and independent
of it, in which capacity he probably
appeared himself, taking various parts
in the same piece, under various disguises,
which he was enabled to assume by means
of linen masks, the invention of which is
attributed to him. Now as a chorus, by
means of its leader, could maintain a dialogue
with the actor, it is easy to see how
with one actor only a dramatic action might
be introduced, continued, and concluded, by
the speeches between the choral songs expressive
of the joy or sorrow of the chorus
at the various events of the drama. With
respect to the character of the drama of
Thespis there has been much doubt: some
writers, and especially Bentley, have maintained
that his plays were all satyrical and
ludicrous, i.e. the plot of them was some
story of Bacchus, the chorus consisted principally
of satyrs, and the argument was merry.
But perhaps the truth is that in the early
part of his career Thespis retained the satyrical
character of the older tragedy, but
afterwards inclined to more serious compositions,
which would almost oblige him to discard
the Satyrs from his choruses. That he
did write serious dramas is intimated by the
titles of the plays ascribed to him, as well as
by the character of the fragments of Iambic
verse quoted by ancient writers as his. It
is evident that the introduction of the dialogue
must also have caused an alteration in
the arrangement of the chorus, which could
not remain cyclic or circular, but must have
been drawn up in a rectangular form about
the thymele or altar of Bacchus in front of
the actor, who was elevated on a platform or
table (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλεός</span>), the forerunner of the stage.
The lines of Horace (<cite>Ar. Poet.</cite> 276):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Dicitur et plaustris vexisse poemata Thespis,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quae canerent agerentque peruncti faecibus ora”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">are founded on a misconception of the origin
of the Attic tragedy, and the tale about the
waggons of Thespis probably arose out of a
confusion of the waggon of the comedian Susarion
with the <em>platform</em> of the Thespian actor.
The first representation of Thespis was in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
535. His immediate successors were the Athenian
Choerilus and Phrynichus, the former of
whom represented plays as early as <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 524.
Phrynichus was a pupil of Thespis, and gained
his first victory in the dramatic contests <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
511. In his works, the lyric or choral element
still predominated over the dramatic,
and he was distinguished for the sweetness
of his melodies, which in the time of the
Peloponnesian war were very popular with
the admirers of the old style of music. The
first use of female masks is also attributed to
him, and he so far deviated from the general
practice of the Attic tragedians as to write
a drama on a subject of contemporary history,
the capture of Miletus by the Persians, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
494.&mdash;We now come to the first writer of
Satyrical dramas, Pratinas of Phlius, a town
not far from Sicyon, and which laid claim to
the invention of tragedy as well as comedy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
For some time previously to this poet, and
probably as early as Thespis, tragedy had
been gradually departing more and more from
its old characteristics, and inclining to heroic
fables, to which the chorus of Satyrs was not
a fit accompaniment. But the fun and merriment
caused by them were too good to be
lost. Accordingly the Satyrical drama, distinct
from the recent and dramatic tragedy,
but suggested by the sportive element of the
old Dithyramb, was founded by Pratinas,
who however appears to have been surpassed
in his own invention by Choerilus. It was
always written by tragedians, and generally
three tragedies and one Satyrical piece were
represented together, which in some instances
at least formed a connected whole, called a
tetralogy (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετραλογία</span>). The Satyrical piece
was acted last, so that the minds of the spectators
were agreeably relieved by a merry
after-piece at the close of an earnest and engrossing
tragedy. The distinguishing feature
of this drama was the chorus of Satyrs, in
appropriate dresses and masks, and its subjects
seem to have been taken from the same
class of the adventures of Bacchus and of the
heroes as those of tragedy; but of course
they were so treated and selected, that the
presence of rustic satyrs would seem appropriate.
In their jokes and drollery consisted
the merriment of the piece; for the kings and
heroes who were introduced into their company
were not of necessity thereby divested of their
epic and legendary character, though they were
obliged to conform to their situation and suffer
some diminution of dignity, from their position.
Hence Horace (<cite>Ar. Poet.</cite> 231) says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Effutire leves indigna Tragoedia versus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Intererit Satyris paulum pudibunda protervis.”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">alluding in the first line to the mythic or
epic element of the Satyric drama, which he
calls Tragoedia, and in the second representing
it as being rather ashamed of its company.
The “Cyclops” of Euripides is the
only Satyric drama now extant.&mdash;The great
improvements in tragedy were introduced by
Aeschylus. This poet added a second actor,
diminished the parts of the chorus, and made
the dialogue the principal part of the action.
He also availed himself of the aid of Agatharchus,
the scene-painter, and improved
the costume of his actors by giving them
thick-soled boots (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐμβάται</span>), as well as the
masks, which he made more expressive and
characteristic. Horace (<cite>Ar. Poet.</cite> 278) thus
alludes to his improvements:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent8">“personae pallaeque repertor honestae</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aeschylus, et modicis instravit pulpita tignis</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Et docuit magnumque loqui, nitique cothurno.”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The custom of contending with trilogies (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριλογίαι</span>),
or with three plays at a time, is said
to have been also introduced by him. In
fact he did so much for tragedy, and so completely
built it up to its “towering height,”
that he was considered the father of it. The
subjects of his dramas were not connected
with the worship of Dionysus; but rather
with the great cycle of Hellenic legends and
some of the myths of the Homeric Epos. Accordingly,
he said of himself that his dramas
were but scraps and fragments from the great
feasts of Homer. In the latter part of his
life Aeschylus made use of one of the improvements
of Sophocles, namely the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριταγωνιστής</span>,
or third actor. This was the finishing
stroke to the dramatic element of Attic
tragedy, which Sophocles is said to have matured
by further improvements in costume
and scene-painting. Under him tragedy appears
with less of sublimity and sternness
than in the hands of Aeschylus, but with
more of calm grandeur and quiet dignity and
touching incident. The plays of Sophocles
are the perfection of the Grecian tragic drama,
as a work of art and poetic composition
in a thoroughly chastened and classic style.
In the hands of Euripides tragedy deteriorated
not only in dignity, but also in its
moral and religious significance. He introduces
his heroes in rags and tatters, and
busies them with petty affairs, and makes
them speak the language of every-day life.
As Sophocles said of him, he represented
men not as they ought to be, but as they are,
without any ideal greatness or poetic character.
His dialogues too were little else than
the rhetorical and forensic language of his
day cleverly put into verse: full of sophistry
and quibbling distinctions. One of the
peculiarities of his tragedies was the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόλογος</span>,
an introductory monologue, with which
some hero or god opens the play, telling who
he is, what is the state of affairs, and what
has happened up to the time of his address,
so as to put the audience in possession of
every fact which it might be necessary for
them to know: a very business-like proceeding
no doubt, but a poor make-shift
for artistical skill. The “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus ex machina</span>,”
also, though not always, in a “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nodus, tali
vindice dignus</span>,” was frequently employed by
Euripides to effect the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénoûment</i> of his
pieces. The chorus too no longer discharged
its proper and high functions either as a representative
of the feelings of unprejudiced
observers, or, as one of the actors, and a part
of the whole, joining in the development of
the piece. Many of his choral odes in fact
are but remotely connected in subject with
the action of the play. Another novelty of
Euripides was the use of the monodies or
lyrical songs, in which not the chorus, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
the principal persons of the drama, declare
their emotions and sufferings. Euripides
was also the inventor of tragi-comedy. A
specimen of the Euripidean tragi-comedy is
still extant in the Alcestis, acted <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 438, as
the last of four pieces, and therefore as a
substitute for a Satyrical drama. Though
tragic in its form and some of its scenes, it
has a mixture of comic and satyric characters
(<em>e.g.</em> Hercules) and concludes happily.&mdash;The
parts which constitute a Greek tragedy, <em>as to
its form</em>, are, the prologue, episode, exode,
and choral songs; the last divided into the
parode and stasimon. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρόλογος</span> is all
that part of a tragedy which precedes the
parodos of the chorus, <em>i.e.</em> the first act. The
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπεισόδιον</span> is all the part between whole choral
odes. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔξοδος</span> that part which has no
choral ode after it. Of the choral part the
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάροδος</span> is the first speech of the whole chorus
(not broken up into parts): the stasimon is
without anapaests and trochees. These two
divisions were sung by all the choreutae, but
the “songs on the stage” and the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόμμοι</span> by
a part only. The commus, which properly
means a wailing for the dead, was generally
used to express strong excitement, or lively
sympathy with grief and suffering, especially
by Aeschylus. It was common to the
actors and a portion only of the chorus.
Again the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάροδος</span> was so named as being the
passage-song of the chorus sung while it was
advancing to its proper place in the orchestra,
and therefore in anapaestic or marching
verse: the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στάσιμον</span>, as being chaunted by
the chorus when standing still in its proper
position.&mdash;The materials of Greek tragedy
were the national mythology,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Or the tale of Troy divine.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The exceptions to this were the two historical
tragedies, the “Capture of Miletus” by
Phrynichus, and the “Persians” of Aeschylus;
but they belong to an early period of
the art. Hence the plot and story of the
Grecian tragedy were of necessity known to
the spectators, a circumstance which strongly
distinguishes the ancient tragedy from the
modern.&mdash;The functions of the Chorus in
Greek Tragedy were very important, as described
by Horace (<cite>Ar. Poet.</cite> 193),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">It often expresses the reflections of a dispassionate

With respect to the number of the chorus
see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Chorus">Chorus</a></span>.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span> The tragedy of
the Romans was borrowed from the Greek,
but the construction of the Roman theatre
afforded no appropriate place for the chorus,
which was therefore obliged to appear on the
stage, instead of in the orchestra. The first
tragic poet and actor at Rome was Livius
Andronicus, a Greek by birth, who began to
exhibit in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 240. In his monodies (or
the lyrical parts sung, not by a chorus, but
by one person), it was customary to separate
the singing from the mimetic dancing, leaving
the latter only to the actor, while the
singing was performed by a boy placed near
the flute-player (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante tibicinem</i>); so that the
dialogue only (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diverbia</i>) was left to be spoken
by the actors. Livius Andronicus was followed
by Naevius, Ennius, Pacuvius, and
Attius. These five poets belong to the earlier
epoch of Roman tragedy, in which little was
written but translations and imitations of the
Greek, with occasional insertions of original
matter. How they imitated the structure of
the choral odes is doubtful&mdash;perhaps they
never attempted it. In the age of Augustus
the writing of tragedies, whether original or
imitations, seems to have been quite a fashionable
occupation. The emperor himself attempted
an Ajax, but did not succeed. One
of the principal tragedians of this epoch was
Asinius Pollio, to whom the line (Virg. <cite>Eclog.</cite>
viii. 10) applies&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna cothurno.”</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Ovid wrote a tragedy on the subject of Medea.
Quintilian says of Varius, who was
distinguished in epic as well as tragic poetry,
that his Thyestes might be compared with
any of the Greek tragedies. Some fragments
of this Thyestes are extant, but we have no
other remains of the tragedy of the Augustan
age. The loss perhaps is not great. The
only complete Roman tragedies that have
come down to us are the ten attributed to the
philosopher Seneca; but whether he wrote
any of them or not is a disputed point. To
whatever age they belong, they are beyond
description bombastic and frigid, utterly
unnatural in character and action, full
of the most revolting violations of propriety,
and barren of all theatrical effect.
Still they have had admirers: Heinsius calls
the Hippolytus “divine,” and prefers the
Troades to the Hecuba of Euripides: even
Racine has borrowed from the Hippolytus in
Phèdre. Roman tragedians sometimes wrote
tragedies on subjects taken from their national
history. Pacuvius, <em>e.g.</em> wrote a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paulus</i>, L. Accius a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brutus</i> and a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decius</i>.
Curiatius Maternus, also a distinguished orator
in the reign of Domitian, wrote a Domitius
and a Cato, the latter of which gave
offence to the rulers of the state.</p>

<p id="Tribunal">TRĬBŪNAL, a raised platform, on which

[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Basilica">Basilica</a>.</span>] There was a tribunal in the
camp, which was generally formed of turf,
but sometimes, in a stationary camp, of stone,
from which the general addressed the soldiers,
and where the consul and tribunes of
the soldiers administered justice. When the
general addressed the army from the tribunal
the standards were planted in front of it, and
the army placed round it in order. The address
itself was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Allocutio</i>.</p>


<p id="Tribunus">TRĬBŪNUS, a tribune. This word seems
originally to have indicated an officer connected
with a tribe (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribus</i>), or who represented
a tribe for certain purposes; and this
is indeed the character of the officers who
were designated by it in the earliest times
of Rome, and may be traced also in the later
officers of this name.&mdash;(1) <span class="smcap">Tribunes of the
three ancient tribes.</span>&mdash;At the time when
all the Roman citizens were contained in the
three tribes of the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres,
each of them was headed by a tribune,
and these three tribunes represented their
respective tribes in all civil, religious, and
military affairs; that is to say, they were in
the city the magistrates of the tribes, and
performed the sacra on their behalf, and in
times of war they were their military commanders.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribunus celerum</i> was the
commander of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">celeres</i>, the king’s body-guard,
and not the tribune of the tribe of
the Ramnes, as is supposed by some modern
writers. In what manner the tribunus celerum
was appointed is uncertain, but it is
probable that he was elected by the tribes;
for we find that when the imperium was to
be conferred upon the king, the comitia were
held under the presidency of the tribunus
celerum; and in the absence of the king, to
whom this officer was next in rank, he convoked
the comitia: it was in an assembly of
this kind that Brutus proposed to deprive
Tarquinius of the imperium. A law passed
under the presidency of the tribunus celerum
was called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex tribunicia</i>, to distinguish it
from one passed under the presidency of the
king. The tribunes of the three ancient
tribes ceased to be appointed when these
tribes themselves ceased to exist as political
bodies, and when the patricians became incorporated
in the local tribes of Servius
Tullius. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribus">Tribus</a>.</span>]&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Tribunes of the
Servian tribes</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φύλαρχοι, τριττυάρχοι</span>).&mdash;When
Servius Tullius divided the commonalty
into thirty local tribes, we again find a
tribune at the head of these tribes. The
duties of these tribunes, who were without
doubt the most distinguished persons in their
respective districts, appear to have consisted
at first in keeping a register of the inhabitants
in each district, and of their property,
for purposes of taxation, and for levying the
troops for the armies. When subsequently
the Roman people became exempted from
taxes, the main part of their business was
taken from them, but they still continued to
exist. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni aerarii</i>, who occur down
to the end of the republic, were perhaps only
the successors of the tribunes of the tribes.
When (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 406) the custom of giving pay
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stipendium</i>) to the soldiers was introduced,
each of the tribuni aerarii had to collect the
tributum in his own tribe, and with it to pay
the soldiers; and in case they did not fulfil
this duty, the soldiers had the right of pignoris
capio against them. In later times
their duties appear to have been confined to
collecting the tributum, which they made
over to the military quaestors who paid the
soldiers. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Quaestor">Quaestor</a>.</span>] The Lex Aurelia,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 70, called the tribuni aerarii to the
exercise of judicial functions, along with the
senators and equites, as these tribunes represented
the body of the most respectable
citizens. But of this distinction they were
subsequently deprived by Julius Caesar.&mdash;(3)
<span class="smcap">Tribuni Plebis</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δήμαρχοι</span>, the office
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δημαρχία</span>).&mdash;The ancient tribunes of the
plebeian tribes had undoubtedly the right
of convoking the meetings of their tribes,
and of maintaining the privileges granted to
them by king Servius, and subsequently by
the Valerian laws. But this protection was
very inadequate against the insatiable ambition
and usurpations of the patricians.
When the plebeians, impoverished by long
wars, and cruelly oppressed by the patricians,
at last seceded in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 494 to the Mons
Sacer, the patricians were obliged to grant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
to the plebeians the right of appointing tribunes
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribuni plebis</i>) with more efficient
powers to protect their own order than those
which were possessed by the heads of the
tribes. The purpose for which they were
appointed was only to afford protection
against any abuse on the part of the patrician
magistrates; and that they might be able to
afford such protection their persons were
declared sacred and inviolable, and it was
agreed that whoever invaded this inviolability
should be an outlaw, and that his property
should be forfeited to the temple of
Ceres. A subsequent law enacted that no
one should oppose or interrupt a tribune
while addressing the people, and that whoever
should act contrary to this ordinance
should give bail to the tribunes for the payment
of whatever fine they should affix to
his offence in arraigning him before the
commonalty; if he refused to give bail, his
life and property were forfeited. The tribunes
were thus enabled to afford protection
to any one who appealed to the assembly of
the commonalty or required any other assistance.
They were essentially the representatives
and the organs of the plebeian order,
and their sphere of action was the comitia
tributa. With the patricians and their comitia
they had nothing to do. The tribunes
themselves, however, were not judges, and
could inflict no punishments, but could only
propose the imposition of a fine to the commonalty
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">multam irrogare</i>). The tribunes
were thus in their origin only a protecting
magistracy of the plebs, but in the course of
time their power increased to such a degree
that it surpassed that of all other magistrates,
and the tribunes then became a magistracy
for the whole Roman people, in opposition to
the senate and the oligarchical party in general,
although they had nothing to do with the
administration or the government. During
the latter period of the republic they became
true tyrants, and may be compared to the
national convention of France during the
first revolution. At first the number of the
tribunes was only two, but soon afterwards
they were increased to five, one being taken
from each of the five classes, and subsequently
to ten, two being taken from each of
the five classes. This last number appears
to have remained unaltered down to the end
of the empire. The tribunes entered upon
their office on the 10th of December, but
were elected, at least in the time of Cicero,
on the 17th of July. It is almost superfluous
to state that none but plebeians were eligible
to the office of tribune; hence when, towards
the end of the republic, patricians wished to
obtain the office, they were obliged first to
renounce their own order and to become plebeians;
hence also under the empire it was
thought that the princeps should not be tribune
because he was a patrician. But the
influence which belonged to this office was
too great for the emperors not to covet it.
Hence Augustus was made tribune for life.
During the republic, however, the old regulation
remained in force, even after the tribunes
had ceased to be the protectors of the
plebs alone. There is only one instance recorded
in which patricians were elected to
the tribuneship, and this was probably the
consequence of an attempt to divide the tribuneship
between the two orders. Although
nothing appears to be more natural than
that the tribunes should originally have been
elected by that body of Roman citizens which
they represented, yet the subject is involved
in considerable obscurity. Some writers state
that they were elected by the comitia of the
curies; others suppose that they were elected
in the comitia of the centuries; but whether
they were elected in the latter or in the
comitia of the tribes, it is certain that at first
the sanction of the curies to the election was
at all events necessary. But after the time
of the Lex Publilia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 472) the sanction
of the curies is not heard of, and the election
of the tribunes was left entirely to the comitia
tributa, which were convoked and held
for this purpose by the old tribunes previous
to the expiration of their office. One of the
old tribunes was appointed by lot to preside
at the election. As the meeting could not
be prolonged after sunset, and the business
was to be completed in one day, it sometimes
happened that it was obliged to break up
before the election was completed, and then
those who were elected filled up the legitimate
number of the college by cooptatio.
But in order to prevent this irregularity, the
tribune L. Trebonius, in 448 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, got an
ordinance passed, according to which the
college of the tribunes should never be completed
by cooptatio, but the elections should
be continued on the second day, if they were
not completed on the first, till the number
ten was made up. The place where the election
of the tribunes was held was originally
and lawfully the Forum, afterwards also the
Campus Martius, and sometimes the area of
the Capitol.&mdash;We now proceed to trace the
gradual growth of the tribunitian power.
Although its original character was merely
protection (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auxilium</i> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βοήθεια</span>) against patrician
magistrates, the plebeians appear
early to have regarded their tribunes also as
mediators or arbitrators in matters among
themselves. The whole power possessed by
the college of tribunes was designated by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribunicia potestas</i>, and extended at no
time farther than one mile beyond the gates
of the city; at a greater distance than this
they came under the imperium of the magistrates,
like every other citizen. As they
were the public guardians, it was necessary
that every one should have access to them
and at any time; hence the doors of their
houses were open day and night for all who
were in need of help and protection, which
they were empowered to afford against any
one, even against the highest magistrates.
For the same reason a tribune was not allowed
to be absent from the city for a whole
day, except during the Feriae Latinae, when
the whole people were assembled on the
Alban Mount. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 456 the tribunes, in
opposition to the consuls, assumed the right
of convoking the senate, in order to lay
before it a rogation, and discuss the same;
for until that time the consuls alone had had
the right of laying plebiscita before the
senate for approbation. Some years after,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 452, the tribunes demanded of the consuls
to request the senate to make a senatusconsultum
for the appointment of persons
to frame a new legislation; and during the
discussions on this subject the tribunes themselves
were present in the senate. The
written legislation which the tribunes then
wished can only have related to their own
order; but as such a legislation would only
have widened the breach between the two
orders, they afterwards gave way to the remonstrances
of the patricians, and the new
legislation was to embrace both orders.
From the second decemvirate the tribuneship
was suspended, but was restored after
the legislation was completed, and now
assumed a different character from the change
that had taken place in the tribes. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Tribus">Tribus</a>.</span>]
The tribunes now had the right to be present
at the deliberations of the senate; but they
did not sit among the senators themselves,
but upon benches before the opened doors of
the senate house. The inviolability of the
tribunes, which had before only rested upon
a contract between the two estates, was now
sanctioned and confirmed by a law of M.
Horatius. As the tribes now also included
the patricians and their clients, the tribunes
might naturally be asked to interpose on
behalf of any citizen, whether patrician or
plebeian. Hence the patrician ex-decemvir,
Appius Claudius, implored the protection of
the tribunes. About this time the tribunes
also acquired the right of taking the auspices
in the assemblies of the tribes. They also
assumed again the right, which they had
exercised before the time of the decemvirate,
of bringing patricians who had violated the
rights of the plebeians before the comitia of
the tribes. By the Lex Valeria passed in the
Comitia Centuriata (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 449), it was enacted
that a plebiscitum, which had been voted by
the tribes, should bind the patricians as well.
While the college thus gained outwardly new
strength every day, a change took place in
its internal organisation, which to some extent
paralysed its powers. Before <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 394,
every thing had been decided in the college
by a majority; but about this time, we do
not know how, a change was introduced,
which made the opposition (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intercessio</i>) of
one tribune sufficient to render a resolution
of his colleagues void. This new regulation
does not appear in operation till 394 and 393
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; the old one was still applied in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
421 and 415. From their right of appearing
in the senate, and of taking part in its discussions,
and from their being the representatives
of the whole people, they gradually
obtained the right of intercession against any
action which a magistrate might undertake
during the time of his office, and this even
without giving any reason for it. Thus we
find a tribune preventing a consul from convoking
the senate, and preventing the proposal
of new laws or elections in the comitia;
they interceded against the official functions
of the censors; and even against a command
issued by the praetor. In the same manner
a tribune might place his veto upon an ordinance
of the senate; and he could thus either
compel the senate to submit the subject to a
fresh consideration, or could raise the session.
In order to propose a measure to the senate
they might themselves convene a meeting, or
when it had been convened by a consul they
might make their proposal even in opposition
to the consul, a right which no other magistrates
had in the presence of the consuls.
The senate, on the other hand, had itself, in
certain cases, recourse to the tribunes. Thus,
in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 431 it requested the tribunes to compel
the consuls to appoint a dictator, in compliance
with a decree of the senate, and the
tribunes compelled the consuls, by threatening
them with imprisonment, to appoint A. Postumius
Tubertus dictator. From this time
forward we meet with several instances in
which the tribunes compelled the consuls to
comply with the decrees of the senate, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">si non
essent in auctoritate senatus</i>, and to execute
its commands. In their relation to the senate
a change was introduced by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plebiscitum
Atinium</i>, which ordained that a tribune, by
virtue of his office, should be a senator.
When this plebiscitum was made is uncertain;
but we know that in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 170 it was not yet
in operation. It probably originated with
C. Atinius, who was tribune in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 132.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
But as the quaestorship, at least in later
times, was the office which persons held previously
to the tribuneship, and as the quaestorship
itself conferred upon a person the
right of a senator, the law of Atinius was in
most cases superfluous.&mdash;In their relation to
other magistrates we may observe, that the
right of intercessio was not confined to stopping
a magistrate in his proceedings, but
they might even command their viatores to
seize a consul or a censor, to imprison him,
or to throw him from the Tarpeian rock.
When the tribunes brought an accusation
against any one before the people, they had
the right of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prehensio</i>, but not the right of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vocatio</i>, that is, they might command a person
to be dragged by their viatores before
the comitia, but they could not summon him.
They might, as in earlier times, propose a
fine to be inflicted upon the person accused
before the comitia, but in some cases they
dropped this proposal and treated the case as
a capital one. The college of tribunes had
also the power of making edicts. In cases in
which one member of the college opposed a
resolution of his colleagues nothing could be
done, and the measure was dropped; but
this useful check was removed by the example
of Tiberius Gracchus, in which a precedent
was given for proposing to the people that a
tribune obstinately persisting in his veto
should be deprived of his office. From the
time of the Hortensian law the power of the
tribunes had been gradually rising to such a
height that at length it was superior to every
other in the state. They had acquired the
right of proposing to the comitia tributa or
the senate measures on nearly all the important
affairs of the state, and it would be
endless to enumerate the cases in which their
power was manifested. Their proposals were
indeed usually made ex auctoritate senatus,
or had been communicated to and approved
by it; but cases in which the people itself
had a direct interest, such as a general legal
regulation, granting of the franchise, a change
in the duties and powers of a magistrate, and
others, might be brought before the people,
without their having been previously communicated
to the senate, though there are also
instances of the contrary. Subjects belonging
to the administration could not be brought
before the tribes without the tribunes having
previously received through the consuls the
auctoritas of the senate. This, however, was
done very frequently, and hence we have
mention of a number of plebiscita on matters
of administration. It sometimes even occurs
that the tribunes brought the question concerning
the conclusion of peace before the
tribes, and then compelled the senate to
ratify the resolution, as expressing the wish
of the whole people. Sulla, in his reform of
the constitution on the early aristocratic
principles, left to the tribunes only the jus
auxiliandi, and deprived them of the right of
making legislative or other proposals, either
to the senate or the comitia, without having
previously obtained the sanction of the senate.
But this arrangement did not last, for Pompey
restored to them their former rights.
During the latter period of the republic,
when the office of quaestor was in most cases
held immediately before that of tribune, the
tribunes were generally elected from among
the senators, and this continued to be the
case under the empire. Sometimes, however,
equites also obtained the office, and
thereby became members of the senate, where
they were considered of equal rank with the
quaestors. Tribunes of the people continued
to exist down to the fifth century of our era,
though their powers became naturally much
limited, especially in the reign of Nero. They
continued however to have the right of intercession
against decrees of the senate, and on
behalf of injured individuals.&mdash;(4) <span class="smcap">Tribuni
militum cum consulari potestate.</span> When in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 445 the tribune C. Canuleius brought
forward the rogation that the consulship
should not be confined to either order, the
patricians evaded the attempt by a change in
the constitution; the powers which had
hitherto been united in the consulship were
now divided between two new magistrates,
viz. the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tribuni militum cum consulari potestate</i>
and the censors. Consequently, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
444, three military tribunes, with consular
power, were appointed, and to this office the
plebeians were to be equally eligible with the
patricians. For the years following, however,
the people were to be at liberty, on the
proposal of the senate, to decide whether
consuls were to be elected according to the
old custom, or consular tribunes. Henceforth,
for many years, sometimes consuls and
sometimes consular tribunes were appointed,
and the number of the latter varied from
three to four, until in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 405 it was increased
to six, and as the censors were regarded
as their colleagues, we have sometimes
mention of eight tribunes. At last,
however, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 367, the office of these
tribunes was abolished by the Licinian law,
and the consulship was restored. These
consular tribunes were elected in the comitia
of the centuries, and undoubtedly with less
solemn auspices than the consuls.&mdash;(5) <span class="smcap">Tribuni

<p id="Tribus">TRĬBUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φῦλον</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φυλή</span>), a tribe. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span>
In the earliest times of Greek history mention
is made of people being divided into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
tribes and clans. Homer speaks of such divisions
in terms which seem to imply that
they were elements that entered into the
composition of every community. A person
not included in any clan (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀφρήτωρ</span>), was regarded
as a vagrant or outlaw. These divisions
were rather natural than political,
depending on family connection, and arising
out of those times, when each head of a
family exercised a patriarchal sway over its
members. The bond was cemented by religious
communion, sacrifices and festivals,
which all the family or clansmen attended,
and at which the chief usually presided.&mdash;Of
the Dorian race there were originally
three tribes, traces of which are found in
all the countries which they colonised.
Hence they are called by Homer <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δωριέες
τριχάϊκες</span>. These tribes were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylleis</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὑλλεῖς</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pamphyli</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πάμφυλοι</span>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dymanatae</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dymanes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δυμανάται</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δυμᾶνες</span>). The
first derived their name from Hyllus, son of
Hercules, the two last from Pamphylus and
Dymas, who are said to have fallen in the
last expedition when the Dorians took possession
of the Peloponnesus. The Hyllean
tribe was perhaps the one of highest dignity;
but at Sparta there does not appear to have
been much distinction, for all the freemen
there were by the constitution of Lycurgus
on a footing of equality. To these three
tribes others were added in different places,
either when the Dorians were joined by other
foreign allies, or when some of the old inhabitants
were admitted to the rank of citizenship
or equal privileges. Thus the Cadmean
Aegeids are said by Herodotus to have been
a great tribe at Sparta, descended (as he
says) from Aegeus, grandson of Theras,
though others have thought they were incorporated
with the three Doric tribes. The
subdivision of tribes into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phratriae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φρατρίαι</span>)
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patrae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πάτραι</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genē</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένη</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trittyes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρίττυες</span>),
&amp;c. appears to have prevailed in various
places. At Sparta each tribe contained ten
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὠβαί</span>), a word denoting a local division
or district; each <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obe</i> contained ten <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triacades</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριακάδες</span>), communities containing thirty
families. But very little appears to be known
of these divisions, how far they were local,
or how far genealogical. After the time of
Cleomenes the old system of tribes was
changed; new ones were created corresponding
to the different quarters of the town,
and they seem to have been five in number.&mdash;The
first Attic tribes that we read of are said
to have existed in the reign, or soon after
the reign, of Cecrops, and were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cecropis</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κεκροπίς</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Autochthon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αὐτόχθων</span>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actaea</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀκταία</span>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paralia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Παραλία</span>). In
the reign of a subsequent king, Cranaus,
these names were changed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cranais</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κραναΐς</span>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atthis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀτθίς</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mesogaea</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μεσόγαια</span>),
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diacris</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διακρίς</span>). Afterwards we find
a new set of names; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dias</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διάς</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Athenais</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀθηναΐς</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poseidonias</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ποσειδωνιάς</span>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hephaestias</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἡφαιστιάς</span>); evidently derived
from the deities who were worshipped in the
country. Some of those secondly mentioned,
if not all of them, seem to have been geographical
divisions; and it is not improbable
that, if not independent communities, they
were at least connected by a very weak bond
of union. But all these tribes were superseded
by four others, which were probably
founded soon after the Ionic settlement in
Attica, and seem to have been adopted by
other Ionic colonies out of Greece. The
names <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geleontes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γελέοντες</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hopletes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ὅπλητες</span>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Argades</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀργάδεις</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aegicores</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Αἰγικορεῖς</span>),
are said by Herodotus to have been
derived from the sons of Ion, son of Xuthus.
Upon this, however, many doubts have been
thrown by modern writers. The etymology
of the last three names would seem to suggest,
that the tribes were so called from the
occupations which their respective members
followed; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hopletes</i> being the armed men,
or warriors; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Argades</i>, labourers or husbandmen;
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aegicores</i>, goatherds or shepherds.
But whatever be the truth with
respect to the origin of these tribes, one thing
is certain, that before the time of Theseus,
whom historians agree in representing as the
great founder of the Attic commonwealth,
the various people who inhabited the country
continued to be disunited and split into factions.&mdash;Theseus
in some measure changed
the relations of the tribes to each other, by
introducing a gradation of ranks in each;
dividing the people into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eupatridae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Εὐπατρίδαι</span>),
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geomori</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Γεωμόροι</span>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Demiurgi</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Δημιουργοί</span>), of whom the first were nobles,
the second agriculturists or yeomen, the
third labourers and mechanics. At the
same time, in order to consolidate the national
unity, he enlarged the city of Athens,
with which he incorporated several smaller
towns, made it the seat of government,
encouraged the nobles to reside there, and
surrendered a part of the royal prerogative
in their favour. The tribes or phylae
were divided, either in the age of Theseus
or soon after, each into three <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phratriae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φρατρίαι</span>,
a term equivalent to fraternities, and
analogous in its political relation to the
Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curiae</i>), and each <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phratria</i> into thirty
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gene</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένη</span>, equivalent to the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gentes</i>),
the members of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genos</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένος</span>) being called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gennetae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γεννῆται</span>) or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homogalactes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὁμογαλάκτες</span>).
Each <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genos</i> was distinguished by a
particular name of a patronymic form, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
was derived from some hero or mythic ancestor.
These divisions, though the names
seem to import family connection, were in
fact artificial; which shows that some advance
had now been made towards the establishment
of a closer political union. The
members of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phratriae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gene</i> had their
respective religious rites and festivals, which
were preserved long after these communities
had lost their political importance, and perhaps
prevented them from being altogether
dissolved.&mdash;After the age of Theseus, the
monarchy having been first limited and afterwards
abolished, the whole power of the
state fell into the hands of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eupatridae</i> or
nobles, who held all civil offices, and had besides
the management of religious affairs, and
the interpretation of the laws. Attica became
agitated by feuds, and we find the people,
shortly before the legislation of Solon, divided
into three parties, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pediaei</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πεδιαῖοι</span>) or lowlanders,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diacrii</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διάκριοι</span>) or highlanders,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parali</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πάραλοι</span>) or people of the sea-coast.
The first two remind us of the ancient
division of tribes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mesogaea</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diacris</i>;
and the three parties appear in some
measure to represent the classes established
by Theseus, the first being the nobles, whose
property lay in the champaign and most
fertile part of the country; the second, the
smaller landowners and shepherds; the
third, the trading and mining class, who
had by this time risen in wealth and importance.
To appease their discords, Solon
was applied to; and thereupon framed his
celebrated constitution and code of laws.
Here we have only to notice that he retained
the four tribes as he found them, but abolished
the existing distinctions of <em>rank</em>, or at
all events greatly diminished their importance,
by introducing his property qualification,
or division of the people into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pentacosiomedimni</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Πεντακοσιομέδιμνοι</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippeis</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἱππεῖς</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zeugitae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ζευγῖται</span>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thetes</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θῆτες</span>). [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Census">Census</a></span>, <span class="smcap">Greek</span>.] The enactments
of Solon continued to be the <em>law</em> at Athens,
though in great measure suspended by the
tyranny, until the democratic reform effected
by Clisthenes. He abolished the old tribes,
and created ten new ones, according to a
geographical division of Attica, and named
after ten of the ancient heroes: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erechtheis</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aegeis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pandionis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leontis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acamantis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oeneis</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cecropis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippothoontis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aeantis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiochis</i>.
These tribes were divided each into ten
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demi</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δῆμοι</span>), the number of which was afterwards
increased by subdivision; but the
arrangement was so made that several <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demi</i>
not contiguous or near to one another were
joined to make up a tribe. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Demus">Demus</a>.</span>] The
object of this arrangement was, that by the
breaking of old associations a perfect and
lasting revolution might be effected, in the
habits and feelings, as well as the political
organisation of the people. Solon allowed
the ancient <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phratriae</i> to exist, but they were
deprived of all political importance. All
foreigners admitted to the citizenship were
registered in a phyle and demus, but not in
a phratria or genos. The functions which
had been discharged by the old tribes were
now mostly transferred to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demi</i>. Among
others, we may notice that of the forty-eight
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">naucrariae</i> into which the old tribes had
been divided for the purpose of taxation, but
which now became useless, the taxes being
collected on a different system. The reforms
of Clisthenes were destined to be permanent.
They continued to be in force (with
some few interruptions) until the downfall of
Athenian independence. The ten tribes were
blended with the whole machinery of the
constitution. Of the senate of five hundred,
fifty were chosen from each tribe. The
allotment of dicasts was according to tribes;
and the same system of election may be
observed in most of the principal offices of
state, judicial and magisterial, civil and military,
&amp;c. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 307, Demetrius Poliorcetes
increased the number of tribes to twelve
by creating two new ones, namely, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antigonias</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Demetrias</i>, which afterwards received
the names of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ptolemais</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Attalis</i>;
and a thirteenth was subsequently added by
Hadrian, bearing his own name.&mdash;(2) <span id="Trib_r" class="smcap">Roman.</span>
The three ancient Romulian tribes,
the Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres, or the
Ramnenses, Titienses, and Lucerenses, to
which the patricians alone belonged, must
be distinguished from the thirty plebeian
tribes of Servius Tullius, which were entirely
local, four for the city, and twenty-six for
the country around Rome. The history and
organisation of the three ancient tribes are
spoken of under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Patricii">Patricii</a></span>. They continued
of political importance almost down to the
period of the decemviral legislation; but
after this time they no longer occur in the
history of Rome, except as an obsolete institution.
The institution and organisation
of the thirty plebeian tribes, and their subsequent
reduction to twenty by the conquests
of Porsena, are spoken of under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Plebes">Plebes</a></span>.
The four city tribes were called by the same
names as the regions which they occupied,
viz. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Suburana</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Esquilina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Collina</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Palatina</i>.
The names of the sixteen country
tribes which continued to belong to Rome
after the conquest of Porsena, are in their
alphabetical order as follows: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aemilia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Camilia</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cornelia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fabia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Galeria</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Horatia</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lemonia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Menemia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Papiria</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pollia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Popillia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
upinia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Romilia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sergia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veturia</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Voltinia</i>.
As Rome gradually acquired possession
of more of the surrounding territory,
the number of tribes also was gradually increased.
When Appius Claudius, with his
numerous train of clients, emigrated to Rome,
lands were assigned to them in the district
where the Anio flows into the Tiber, and a
new tribe, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tribus Claudia</i>, was formed.
This tribe was subsequently enlarged, and
was then designated by the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crustumina</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clustumina</i>. This name is the
first instance of a country tribe being named
after a place, for the sixteen older ones all
derived their name from persons or heroes.
In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 387, the number of tribes was increased
to twenty-five by the addition of
four new ones, viz. the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stellatina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tromentina</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sabatina</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Arniensis</i>. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 358
two more, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pomptina</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Publilia</i>, were
formed of Volscians. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 332, the censors
Q. Publilius Philo and Sp. Postumius
increased the number of tribes to twenty-nine,
by the addition of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Maecia</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scaptia</i>. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 318 the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ufentina</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falerina</i> were added. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 299 two
others, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aniensis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Terentina</i>, were
added by the censors, and at last in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 241,
the number of tribes was augmented to
thirty-five, by the addition of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quirina</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Velina</i>. Eight new tribes were added
upon the termination of the Social War, to
include the Socii, who then obtained the Roman
franchise; but they were afterwards
incorporated among the old 35 tribes, which
continued to be the number of the tribes to
the end of the republic. When the tribes,
in their assemblies, transacted any business,
a certain order (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordo tribuum</i>) was observed,
in which they were called upon to give their
votes. The first in the order of succession
was the Suburana, and the last the Arniensis.
Any person belonging to a tribe
had in important documents to add to his
own name that of his tribe, in the ablative
case. Whether the local tribes, as they were
established by the constitution of Servius
Tullius, contained only the plebeians, or
included the patricians also, is a point on
which the opinions of modern scholars are
divided: but it appears most probable that
down to the decemviral legislation the tribes
and their assemblies were entirely plebeian.
From the time of the decemviral legislation,
the patricians and their clients were undoubtedly
incorporated in the tribes. Respecting
the assemblies of the tribes, see
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Comitia_tr">Comitia Tributa</a></span>.</p>


<p id="Tributum">TRĬBŪTUM, a tax which was partly applied
to cover the expenses of war, and
partly those of the fortifications of the city.
The usual amount of the tax was one for
every thousand of a man’s fortune, though
in the time of Cato it was raised to three in
a thousand. The tributum was not a property-tax
in the strict sense of the word, for
the accounts respecting the plebeian debtors
clearly imply, that the debts were not deducted
in the valuation of a person’s property,
so that he had to pay the tributum
upon property which was not his own, but
which he owed, and for which he had consequently
to pay the interest as well. It was
a direct tax upon objects without any regard
to their produce, like a land or house-tax,
which indeed formed the main part of it.
That which seems to have made it most oppressive,
was its constant fluctuation. It
was raised according to the regions or tribes
instituted by Servius Tullius, and by the tribunes
of these tribes, subsequently called
tribuni aerarii. It was not, like the other
branches of the public revenue, let out to
farm, but being fixed in money it was raised
by the tribunes, unless (as was the case after
the custom of giving pay to the soldiers was
introduced) the soldiers, like the knights,
demanded it from the persons themselves
who were bound to pay it. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aes_e">Aes equestre</a></span>
and <span class="allsmcap">HORDEARIUM</span>.] When this tax was to
be paid, what sum was to be raised, and what
portion of every thousand asses of the census,
were matters upon which the senate alone
had to decide. But when it was decreed, the
people might refuse to pay it when they
thought it too heavy, or unfairly distributed,
or hoped to gain some other advantage by
the refusal. In later times the senate sometimes
left its regulation to the censors, who
often fixed it very arbitrarily. No citizen
was exempt from it, but we find that the
priests, augurs, and pontiffs made attempts
to get rid of it: but this was only an abuse,
which did not last. After the war with Macedonia
(<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 147), when the Roman treasury
was filled with the revenues accruing
from conquests and from the provinces, the
Roman citizens became exempted from paying
the tributum, and this state of things
lasted down to the consulship of Hirtius and
Pansa (43 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), when the tributum was
again levied, on account of the exhausted
state of the aerarium. After this time it was
imposed according to the discretion of the
emperors. Respecting the tributum paid by
conquered countries and cities, see <span class="smcap"><a href="#Vectigalia">Vectigalia</a></span>.</p>


<p id="Triclinium">TRICLĪNĬUM, the dining-room of a Roman
house, the position of which, relatively
to the other parts of the house, is seen in the
“house of the Tragic poet” (see <a href="#ill144">p. 144</a>).
It was of an oblong shape, and was twice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
as long as it was broad. The superintendence
of the dining-room in a great house
was intrusted to a slave called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tricliniarcha</i>,
who, through other slaves, took care that
everything was kept and proceeded in proper
order. A <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triclinium</i> generally contained three
couches, and as the usual number of persons
occupying each couch was three, the triclinium
afforded accommodation for a party of nine.
Sometimes, however, as many as four lay on
each of the couches. Each man in order to
feed himself lay flat upon his breast or nearly
so, and stretched out his hand towards the
table; but afterwards, when his hunger was
satisfied, he turned upon his left side, leaning
on his elbow. To this Horace alludes in
describing a person sated with a particular
dish, and turning in order to repose upon
his elbow. (<cite>Sat.</cite> ii. 4, 39.) We find the
relative positions of two persons who lay
next to one another, commonly expressed by
the prepositions <em>super</em> or <em>supra</em>, and <em>infra</em>.
A passage of Livy (xxxix. 43), in which
he relates the cruel conduct of the consul
L. Quintius Flamininus, shows that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infra aliquem cubare</i> was the same as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
sinu alicujus cubare</i>, and consequently that
each person was considered as <em>below</em> him to
whose breast his own head approached. On
this principle we are enabled to explain the
denominations both of the three couches, and
of the three places on each couch.</p>

as each guest reclined on his left side, the

<p id="Trierarchia">TRIĒRARCHĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριήραρχια</span>), one of the
extraordinary war services or liturgies at
Athens, the object of which was to provide
for the equipment and maintenance of the
ships of war belonging to the state. The
persons who were charged with it were called
trierarchs (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριήραρχοι</span>), as being the captains
of triremes, though the name was also applied
to persons who bore the same charge
in other vessels. It existed from very early
times in connection with the forty-eight
naucraries of Solon, and the fifty of Clisthenes:
each of which corporations appears
to have been obliged to equip and man a vessel.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Naucraria">Naucraria</a>.</span>] Under the constitution
of Clisthenes the ten tribes were at first
severally charged with five vessels. This
charge was of course superseded by the later
forms of the hierarchy. The state furnished
the ship, and either the whole or part of the
ship’s rigging and furniture, and also pay
and provisions for the sailors. The trierarchs
were bound to keep in repair the ship
and its furniture, and were frequently put to
great expense in paying the sailors and supplying
them with provisions, when the state
did not supply sufficient money for the purpose.
Moreover, some trierarchs, whether
from ambitious or patriotic motives, put
themselves to unnecessary expense in fitting
out and rigging their ships, from which the
state derived an advantage. The average
expense of the trierarchy was 50 minae.
In ancient times one person bore the whole
charge of the trierarchy, afterwards it was
customary for two persons to share it, who
were then called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">syntrierarchs</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συντριήραρχοι</span>).
When this practice was first introduced
is not known, but it was perhaps about
the year 412 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, after the defeat of the
Athenians in Sicily, when the union of two
persons for the choregia was first permitted.
The syntrierarchy, however, did not entirely
supersede the older and single form, being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
only meant as a relief in case of emergency,
when there was not a sufficient number of
wealthy citizens to bear the expense singly.
In the case of a syntrierarchy the two trierarchs
commanded their vessel in turn, six
months each, according as they agreed between
themselves.&mdash;The third form of the
trierarchy was connected with, or suggested
by, the syntrierarchy. In <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 358, the
Athenians were unable to procure a sufficient
number of legally appointed trierarchs, and
accordingly they summoned volunteers.
This, however, was but a temporary expedient;
and as the actual system was not
adequate to the public wants, they determined
to manage the trierarchy somewhat in
the same way as the property-tax (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eisphora</i>),
namely, by classes or symmoriae, according
to the law of Periander passed in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 358,
and which was the primary and original
enactment on the subject. With this view
1200 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">synteleis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συντελεῖς</span>) or partners were
appointed, who were probably the wealthiest
individuals of the state, according to the
census or valuation. These were divided into
20 <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">symmoriae</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συμμορίαι</span>) or classes; out of
which a number of persons (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σώματα</span>) joined
for the equipment or rather the maintenance
and management of a ship, under the title of
a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">synteleia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συντέλεια</span>) or union. To every
ship there was generally assigned a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">synteleia</i>
of fifteen persons of different degrees of
wealth, as we may suppose, so that four ships
only were provided for by each symmoria of
sixty persons. It appears, however, that
before Demosthenes carried a new law on
this subject (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 340), it had been customary
for <em>sixteen</em> persons to unite in a synteleia or
company for a ship, who bore the burden in
equal shares. This being the case, it follows
either that the members of the symmoriae
had been by that time raised from 1200 to
1280, or that some alterations had taken
place in their internal arrangements, of which
no account has come down to us. The superintendence
of the whole system was in the
hands of the 300 wealthiest members, who
were therefore called the “leaders of the
symmoriae” (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡγεμόνες τῶν συμμοριῶν</span>), on
whom the burdens of the trierarchy chiefly
fell, or rather ought to have fallen. The
services performed by individuals under this
system appear to have been the same as before:
the state still provided the ship’s
tackle, and the only duty then of the trierarchs
under this system was to keep their
vessels in the same repair and order as they
received them. But even from this they
managed to escape: for the wealthiest members,
who had to serve for their synteleia,
let out their trierarchies for a talent, and received
that amount from their partners (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">συντελεῖς</span>),
so that in reality they paid next to
nothing, or, at any rate, not what they ought
to have done, considering that the trierarchy
was a ground of exemption from other liturgies.&mdash;To
remedy these abuses Demosthenes
carried a law when he was the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστάτης τοῦ
ναυτικοῦ</span>, or the superintendent of the Athenian
navy, thereby introducing the <em>Fourth
form</em> of the trierarchy. The provisions of
the law were as follows: The naval services
required from every citizen were to depend
upon and be proportional to his property,
or rather to his taxable capital, as registered
for the symmoriae of the property-tax, the
rate being one trireme for every ten talents
of taxable capital, up to three triremes and
one auxiliary vessel (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπηρέσιον</span>) for the
largest properties; <em>i.e.</em> no person, however
rich, could be required to furnish more.
Those who had not ten talents in taxable
capital were to club together in synteleiae
till they had made up that amount. By this
law great changes were effected. All persons
paying taxes were rated in proportion
to their property, so that the poor were benefited
by it, and the state likewise: for, as
Demosthenes says, those who had formerly
contributed one-sixteenth to the trierarchy
of one ship were now trierarchs of two, in
which case they must either have served by
proxy, or done duty in successive years. He
adds, that the consequences were highly beneficial.
We do not know the amount of
property which rendered a man liable to serve
a trierarchy or syntrierarchy, but we read of
no instance of liability arising from a property
of less value than 500 minae. The appointment
to serve under the first and second
forms of the trierarchy was made by the
strategi, and in case any person was appointed
to serve a trierarchy, and thought that any
one else (not called upon) was better able to
bear it than himself, he offered the latter an
exchange of his property [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Antidosis">Antidosis</a></span>] subject
to the burden of the trierarchy. In cases of
extreme hardship, persons became suppliants
to the people, or fled to the altar of Artemis
at Munychia. If not ready in time, they
were sometimes liable to imprisonment. On
the contrary, whoever got his ship ready
first was to be rewarded with the “crown
of the trierarchy;” so that in this way considerable
emulation and competition were
produced. Moreover, the trierarchs were <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπεύθυνοι</span>,
or liable to be called to account for
their expenditure; though they applied
their own property to the service of the
state. It has been already stated that the
trierarchy was a ground of exemption from
the other liturgies, any of which, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
gave an exemption, from all the rest during
the following year.</p>

boiling meat, and either raised upon a three-legged

It was from a tripod that the
Pythian priestess at Delphi gave responses.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cortina">Cortina</a>.</span>] The celebrity of this tripod produced
innumerable imitations of it, which
were made to be used in sacrifice, and still
more frequently to be presented to the treasury
both in that place and in many other
Greek temples.</p>

<p id="Triumphus">TRĬUMPHUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρίαμβος</span>), a solemn procession,
in which a victorious general entered
the city in a chariot drawn by four horses.
He was preceded by the captives and spoils
taken in war, was followed by his troops,
and after passing in state along the Via
Sacra, ascended the Capitol to offer sacrifice
in the temple of Jupiter. From the beginning
of the republic down to the extinction of
liberty a regular triumph (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">justus triumphus</i>)
was recognised as the summit of military
glory, and was the cherished object of ambition
to every Roman general. A triumph
might be granted for successful achievements
either by land or sea, but the latter were
comparatively so rare that we shall for the
present defer the consideration of the naval
triumph. After any decisive battle had been
won, or a province subdued by a series of
successful operations, the imperator forwarded
to the senate a laurel-wreathed dispatch
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literae laureatae</i>), containing an account
of his exploits. If the intelligence
proved satisfactory, the senate decreed a
public thanksgiving. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Supplicatio">Supplicatio</a>.</span>] After
the war was concluded, the general with his
army repaired to Rome, or ordered his army
to meet him there on a given day, but did not
enter the city. A meeting of the senate was
held without the walls, usually in the temple
either of Bellona or Apollo, that he might
have an opportunity of urging his pretensions
in person, and these were then scrutinised
and discussed with the most jealous care.
The following rules were for the most part
rigidly enforced, although the senate assumed
the discretionary power of relaxing them in
special cases. 1. That no one could be permitted
to triumph unless he had held the
office of dictator, of consul, or of praetor.
The honours granted to Pompey, who triumphed
in his 24th year (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 81) before he
had held any of the great offices of state, and
again ten years afterwards, while still a
simple eques, were altogether unprecedented.
2. That the magistrate should have been
actually in office both when the victory was
gained and when the triumph was to be celebrated.
This regulation was insisted upon
only during the earlier ages of the commonwealth.
Its violation commenced with Q.
Publilius Philo, the first person to whom the
senate ever granted a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prorogatio imperii</i> after
the termination of a magistracy, and thenceforward
proconsuls and propraetors were
permitted to triumph without question. 3.
That the war should have been prosecuted or
the battle fought under the auspices and in
the province and with the troops of the
general seeking the triumph. Thus if a victory
was gained by the legatus of a general
who was absent from the army, the honour of
it did not belong to the former, but to the
latter, inasmuch as he had the auspices. 4.
That at least 5000 of the enemy should have
been slain in a single battle, that the advantage
should have been positive, and not
merely a compensation for some previous
disaster, and that the loss on the part of the
Romans should have been small compared
with that of their adversaries. But still we
find many instances of triumphs granted for
general results, without reference to the
numbers slain in any one engagement. 5.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
That the war should have been a legitimate
contest against public foes, and not a civil
contest. Hence Catulus celebrated no triumph
over Lepidus, nor Antonius over Catiline,
nor Cinna and Marius over their antagonists
of the Sullan party, nor Caesar after
Pharsalia; and when he did subsequently
triumph after his victory over the sons of
Pompey, it caused universal disgust. 6.
That the dominion of the state should have
been extended, and not merely something
previously lost regained. The absolute acquisition
of territory does not appear to have
been essential. 7. That the war should have
been brought to a conclusion and the province
reduced to a state of peace, so as to permit of
the army being withdrawn, the presence of
the victorious soldiers being considered indispensable
in a triumph. The senate claimed
the exclusive right of deliberating upon all
these points, and giving or withholding the
honour sought, and they for the most part
exercised the privilege without question,
except in times of great political excitement.
The sovereignty of the people, however, in
this matter was asserted at a very early date,
and a triumph is said to have been voted by
the tribes to Valerius and Horatius, the consuls
of <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 446, in direct opposition to the
resolution of the fathers, and in a similar
manner to C. Marcius Rutilus the first plebeian
dictator, while L. Postumius Megellus,
consul <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 294, celebrated a triumph,
although resisted by the senate and seven out
of the ten tribunes. Nay, more, we read of
a certain Appius Claudius, consul <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 143,
who having persisted in celebrating a triumph
in defiance of both the senate and
people, was accompanied by his daughter (or
sister) Claudia, a vestal virgin, and by her
interposition saved from being dragged from
his chariot by a tribune. A disappointed
general, however, seldom ventured to resort
to such violent measures, but satisfied himself
with going through the forms on the
Alban Mount, a practice first introduced by
C. Papirius Maso. If the senate gave their
consent, they at the same time voted a sum
of money towards defraying the necessary
expenses, and one of the tribunes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex auctoritate
senatus</i> applied for a plebiscitum to permit
the imperator to retain his imperium on
the day when he entered the city. This last
form could not be dispensed with either in an
ovation or a triumph, because the imperium
conferred by the comitia curiata did not include
the city itself, and when a general had
once gone forth <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paludatus</i>, his military power
ceased as soon as he re-entered the gates,
unless the general law had been previously
suspended by a special enactment; and in
this manner the resolution of the senate was,
as it were, ratified by the plebs. For this
reason no one desiring a triumph ever entered
the city until the question was decided, since
by so doing he would ipso facto have forfeited
all claim. We have a remarkable example of
this in the case of Cicero, who after his return
from Cilicia lingered in the vicinity of Rome
day after day, and dragged about his lictors
from one place to another, without entering
the city, in the vain hope of a triumph.&mdash;In
later times these pageants were marshalled
with extraordinary pomp and splendour, and
presented a most gorgeous spectacle. Minute
details would necessarily be different according
to circumstances, but the general arrangements
were as follows. The temples were all
thrown open, garlands of flowers decorated
every shrine and image, and incense smoked
on every altar. Meanwhile the imperator
called an assembly of his soldiers, delivered
an oration commending their valour, and
concluded by distributing rewards to the most
distinguished, and a sum of money to each
individual, the amount depending on the
value of the spoils. He then ascended his
triumphal car and advanced to the Porta Triumphalis,
where he was met by the whole body
of the senate headed by the magistrates. The
procession then defiled in the following order.
1. The senate headed by the magistrates.
2. A body of trumpeters. 3. A train of
carriages and frames laden with spoils, those
articles which were especially remarkable
either on account of their beauty or rarity
being disposed in such a manner as to be
seen distinctly by the crowd. Boards were
borne aloft on fercula, on which were
painted in large letters the names of vanquished
nations and countries. Here, too,
models were exhibited in ivory or wood of
the cities and forts captured, and pictures
of the mountains, rivers, and other great
natural features of the subjugated region,
with appropriate inscriptions. Gold and
silver in coin or bullion, arms, weapons,
and horse furniture of every description,
statues, pictures, vases, and other works of
art, precious stones, elaborately wrought
and richly embroidered stuffs, and every
object which could be regarded as valuable
or curious. 4. A body of flute players.
5. The white bulls or oxen destined for
sacrifice, with gilded horns, decorated with
infulae and serta, attended by the slaughtering
priests with their implements, and followed
by the Camilli bearing in their hands
paterae and other holy vessels and instruments.
6. Elephants or any other strange
animals, natives of the conquered districts.
7. The arms and insignia of the leaders of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
the foe. 8. The leaders themselves, and
such of their kindred as had been taken prisoners,
followed by the whole band of inferior
captives in fetters. 9. The coronae and
other tributes of respect and gratitude bestowed
on the imperator by allied kings and
states. 10. The lictors of the imperator in
single file, their fasces wreathed with laurel.
11. The imperator himself in a circular
chariot of a peculiar form, drawn by four
horses, which were sometimes, though rarely,
white. He was attired in a gold-embroidered
robe (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga picta</i>) and flowered tunic
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tunica palmata</i>): he bore in his right hand
a laurel bough, and in his left a sceptre; his
brows were encircled with a wreath of
Delphic laurel, in addition to which in
ancient times, his body was painted bright
red. He was accompanied in his chariot by
his children of tender years, and sometimes
by very dear or highly honoured friends,
while behind him stood a public slave, holding
over his head a golden Etruscan crown
ornamented with jewels. The presence of a
slave in such a place at such a time seems to
have been intended to avert <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">invidia</i> and the
influence of the evil eye, and for the same
purpose a fascinum, a little bell, and a
scourge were attached to the vehicle. Tertullian
tells us, that the slave ever and anon
whispered in the ear of the imperator the
warning words <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Respice post te, hominem memento
te</i>, but this statement is not confirmed
by any earlier writer. 12. Behind the chariot
or on the horses which drew it rode the
grown-up sons of the imperator, together
with the legati, the tribuni, and the equites,
all on horseback. 13. The rear was brought
up by the whole body of the infantry in
marching order, their spears adorned with
laurel, some shouting Io Triumphe, and
singing hymns to the gods, while others
proclaimed the praises of their leader or
indulged in keen sarcasms and coarse ribaldry
at his expense, for the most perfect
freedom of speech was granted and exercised.
Just as the pomp was ascending the
Capitoline hill, some of the hostile chiefs
were led aside into the adjoining prison
and put to death, a custom so barbarous that
we could scarcely believe that it existed in
a civilised age, were it not attested by the
most unquestionable evidence. Pompey, indeed,
refrained from perpetrating this atrocity
in his third triumph, and Aurelian on
like occasion spared Zenobia, but these are
quoted as exceptions to the general rule.
When it was announced that these murders
had been completed, the victims were then
sacrificed, an offering from the spoils was
presented to Jupiter, the laurel wreath was
deposited in the lap of the god, the imperator
was entertained at a public feast along
with his friends in the temple, and returned
home in the evening preceded by torches
and pipes, and escorted by a crowd of citizens.
The whole of the proceedings, generally
speaking, were brought to a close in one
day; but when the quantity of plunder was
very great, and the troops very numerous,
a longer period was required for the exhibition,
and thus the triumph of Flaminius
continued for three days in succession. But
the glories of the imperator did not end with
the show, nor even with his life. It was
customary (we know not if the practice was
invariable) to provide him at the public expense
with a site for a house, such mansions
being styled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triumphales domus</i>. After death
his kindred were permitted to deposit his
ashes within the walls, and laurel-wreathed
statues standing erect in triumphal cars,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
displayed in the vestibulum of the family
mansion, transmitted his fame to posterity.&mdash;A
<span class="smcap">Triumphus Navalis</span> appears to have differed
in no respect from an ordinary triumph, except
that it must have been upon a smaller
scale, and would be characterised by the exhibition
of beaks of ships and other nautical
trophies. The earliest upon record was
granted to C. Duillius, who laid the foundation
of the supremacy of Rome by sea in the first
Punic war; and so elated was he by his success,
that during the rest of his life, whenever
he returned home at night from supper, he
caused flutes to sound and torches to be borne
before him. A second naval triumph was celebrated
by Lutatius Catulus for his victory
off the Insulae Aegates, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 241; a third
by Q. Fabius Labeo, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 189, over the
Cretans; and a fourth by C. Octavius over
King Perseus, without captives and without
spoils.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Triumphus Castrensis</span> was a procession
of the soldiers through the camp in
honour of a tribunus or some officer inferior
to the general, who had performed a brilliant
exploit. After the extinction of freedom, the
emperor being considered as the commander-in-chief
of all the armies of the state, every
military achievement was understood to be
performed under his auspices, and hence,
according to the forms of even the ancient
constitution, he alone had a legitimate claim
to a triumph. This principle was soon fully
recognised and acted upon; for although
Antonius had granted triumphs to his legati,
and his example had been freely followed by
Augustus in the early part of his career, yet
after the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 14, he entirely discontinued
the practice, and from that time forward
triumphs were rarely, if ever, conceded
to any except members of the imperial family.
But to compensate in some degree for what
was then taken away, the custom was introduced
of bestowing what were termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triumphalia
Ornamenta</i>, that is, permission to
receive the titles bestowed upon and to appear
in public with the robes worn by the imperatores
of the commonwealth when they
triumphed, and to bequeath to descendants
triumphal statues. These <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triumphalia ornamenta</i>
are said to have been first bestowed
upon Agrippa or upon Tiberius, and ever
after were a common mark of the favour of
the prince.</p>

<p id="Triumviri">TRĬUMVĬRI, or TRESVĬRI, were either
ordinary magistrates or officers, or else extraordinary
commissioners, who were frequently
appointed at Rome to execute any public
office. The following is a list of the most
important of both classes.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Agro Dividundo.</span> [<span class="smcap">Triumviri
Coloniae Deducendae.</span>]</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Capitales</span> were regular magistrates,
first appointed about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 292.
They were elected by the people, the comitia
being held by the praetor. They succeeded
to many of the functions of the Quaestores
Parricidii. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Quaestor">Quaestor</a>.</span>] It was their duty
to inquire into all capital crimes, and to receive
informations respecting such, and consequently
they apprehended and committed
to prison all criminals whom they detected.
In conjunction with the aediles, they had to
preserve the public peace, to prevent all unlawful
assemblies, &amp;c. They enforced the
payment of fines due to the state. They had
the care of public prisons, and carried into
effect the sentence of the law upon criminals.
In these points they resembled the magistracy
of the Eleven at Athens.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Coloniae Deducendae</span> were
persons appointed to superintend the formation
of a colony. They are spoken of under
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Colonia">Colonia</a></span>, <a href="#Page_99">p. 99</a>, <em>b</em>. Since they had besides
to superintend the distribution of the land
to the colonists, we find them also called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triumviri Coloniae Deducendae Agroque Dividundo</i>,
and sometimes simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triumviri
Agro Dando</i>.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Epulones.</span> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Epulones">Epulones</a>.</span>]</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Equitum Turmas Recognoscendi</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Legendis Equitum Decuriis</span>,
were magistrates first appointed by Augustus
to revise the lists of the equites, and to admit
persons into the order. This was formerly
part of the duties of the censors.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Mensarii.</span> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Mensarii">Mensarii</a>.</span>]</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Monetales.</span> [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Moneta">Moneta</a>.</span>]</p>

<p>9. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Nocturni</span> were magistrates
elected annually, whose chief duty it was to
prevent fires by night, and for this purpose
they had to go round the city during the
night (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vigilias circumire</i>). If they neglected
their duty they appear to have been accused
before the people by the tribunes of the plebs.
The time at which this office was instituted
is unknown, but it must have been previously
to the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 304. Augustus
transferred their duties to the Praefectus
Vigilum. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Praefectus_v">Praefectus Vigilum</a>.</span>]</p>

<p>10. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Reficiendis Aedibus</span>, extraordinary
officers elected in the Comitia
Tributa in the time of the second Punic war,
were appointed for the purpose of repairing
and rebuilding certain temples.</p>

<p>11. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Reipublicae Constituendae.</span>
When the supreme power was shared
between Caesar (Octavianus), Antony, and
Lepidus, they administered the affairs of the
state under the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Triumviri Reipublicae
Constituendae</i>. This office was conferred
upon them in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 43, for five years; and on
the expiration of the term, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 38, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
conferred upon them again, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 37, for
five years more. The coalition between Julius
Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 60,
is usually called the first triumvirate, and
that between Octavianus, Antony, and Lepidus,
the second; but it must be borne in
mind that the former never bore the title of
triumviri, nor were invested with any office
under that name, whereas the latter were
recognised as regular magistrates under the
above-mentioned title.</p>

<p>12. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Sacris Conquirendis Donisque
Persignandis</span>, extraordinary officers
elected in the Comitia Tributa in the time of
the second Punic war, seem to have had to
take care that all property given or consecrated
to the gods was applied to that purpose.</p>

<p>13. <span class="smcap">Triumviri Senatus Legendi</span> were magistrates
appointed by Augustus to admit
persons into the senate. This was previously
the duty of the censors.</p>


<p id="Trochus">TRŎCHUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροχός</span>), a hoop. The Greek
hoop was a bronze ring, and had sometimes
bells attached to it. It was impelled by
means of a hook with a wooden handle,
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clavis</i>, and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐλατήρ</span>. From the Greeks
this custom passed to the Romans, who consequently
adopted the Greek term. The following
woodcuts from gems exhibit naked
youths trundling the hoop by means of the
hook or key. They are accompanied by the
jar of oil and the laurel branch, the signs of
effort and of victory.</p>

<p id="Trojae">TROJAE LŪDUS. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Circus">Circus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Tropaeum">TRŎPAEUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρόπαιον</span>, <em>Att.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροπαῖον</span>), a
trophy, a sign and memorial of victory,
which was erected on the field of battle
where the enemy had turned (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρέπω, τρόπη</span>)
to flight; and in case of a victory gained at
sea, on the nearest land. The expression
for raising or erecting a trophy is <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τροπαῖον
στῆσαι</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στήσασθαι</span>, to which may be added
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπὸ</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατὰ τῶν πολεμίων</span>. When the battle
was not decisive, or each party considered it
had some claims to the victory, both erected
trophies. Trophies usually consisted of the
arms, shields, helmets, &amp;c. of the enemy that
were defeated; and these were placed on the
trunk of a tree, which was fixed on some
elevation. The trophy was consecrated to
some divinity, with an inscription (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπίγραμμα</span>),
recording the names of the victors and of the
defeated party; whence trophies were regarded
as inviolable, which even the enemy
were not permitted to remove. Sometimes,
however, a people destroyed a trophy, if they
considered that the enemy had erected it
without sufficient cause. That rankling and
hostile feelings might not be perpetuated by
the continuance of a trophy, it seems to have
been originally part of Greek international
law that trophies should be made only of
wood, and not of stone or metal, and that
they should not be repaired when decayed.
It was not, however, uncommon to erect
trophies of metal. Pausanias speaks of several
which he saw in Greece. The trophies
erected to commemorate naval victories were
usually ornamented with the beaks or acroteria
of ships [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Acroterium">Acroterium</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Rostra">Rostra</a></span>]; and
were generally consecrated to Poseidon or
Neptune. Sometimes a whole ship was
placed as a trophy. The Romans, in early
times, never erected any trophies on the field
of battle, but carried home the spoils taken
in battle, with which they decorated the
public buildings, and also the private houses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
of individuals. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Spolia">Spolia</a>.</span>] Subsequently,
however, the Romans adopted the Greek
practice of raising trophies on the field of
battle. The first trophies of this kind were
erected by Domitius Ahenobarbus and Fabius
Maximus in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 121, after their conquest
of the Allobroges, when they built at the
junction of the Rhone and the Isara towers
of white stone, upon which trophies were
placed adorned with the spoils of the enemy.
Pompey also raised trophies on the Pyrenees
after his victories in Spain; Julius Caesar
did the same near Ziela, after his victory
over Pharnaces; and Drusus, near the Elbe,
to commemorate his victory over the Germans.
Still, however, it was more common
to erect some memorial of the victory at
Rome than on the field of battle. The
trophies raised by Marius to commemorate
his victories over Jugurtha and the Cimbri
and Teutoni, which were cast down by Sulla,
and restored by Julius Caesar, must have
been in the city. In the later times of the
republic, and under the empire, the erection
of triumphal arches was the most common
way of commemorating a victory, many of
which remain to the present day. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Arcus">Arcus</a>.</span>]</p>

<p id="Trutina">TRŬTĬNA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρυτάνη</span>), a general term, including
both <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libra</i>, a balance, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">statera</i>, a
steelyard. Payments were originally made
by weighing, not by counting. Hence a balance
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trutina</i>) was preserved in the temple
of Saturn at Rome.</p>


<p id="Tuba">TŬBA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάλπιγξ</span>), a bronze trumpet, distinguished
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornu</i> by being straight
while the latter was curved. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Cornu">Cornu</a>.</span>] The
tuba was employed in war for signals of
every description, at the games and public
festivals, and also at the last rites to the
dead: those who sounded the trumpet at funerals
were termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">siticines</i>, and used an instrument
of a peculiar form. The tones of the
tuba are represented as of a harsh and fear-inspiring
character. The invention of the
tuba is usually ascribed by ancient writers to
the Etruscans. It has been remarked that
Homer never introduces the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάλπιγξ</span> in his
narrative except in comparisons, which
leads us to infer that, although known in his
time, it had been but recently introduced
into Greece; and it is certain that, notwithstanding
its eminently martial character, it
was not until a late period used in the
armies of the leading states. By the Greek
tragedians its Tuscan origin is fully recognised.
According to one account it was first
fabricated for the Tyrrhenians by Athena,
who in consequence was worshipped by the
Argives under the title of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Σάλπιγξ</span>, while at
Rome the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tubilustrium</i>, or purification of
sacred trumpets, was performed on the last
day of the Quinquatrus. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Quinquatrus">Quinquatrus</a>.</span>]
There appears to have been no essential
difference in form between the Greek and
Roman or Tyrrhenian trumpets. Both were
long, straight, bronze tubes, gradually increasing
in diameter, and terminating in a
bell-shaped aperture.</p>

<p id="Tumultus">TŬMULTUS, the name given to a sudden
or dangerous war in Italy or Cisalpine Gaul,
and the word was supposed by the ancients
to be a contraction of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">timor multus</i>. It was,
however, sometimes applied to a sudden or
dangerous war elsewhere; but this does not
appear to have been a correct use of the
word. Cicero says that there might be a
war without a tumultus, but not a tumultus
without a war; but it must be recollected
that the word was also applied to any sudden
alarm respecting a war; whence we find a
tumultus often spoken of as of less importance
than a war, because the results were of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
less consequence, though the fear might have
been much greater than in a regular war. In
the case of a tumultus there was a cessation
from all business (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">justitium</i>), and all citizens
were obliged to enlist without regard being
had to the exemptions (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vacationes</i>) from military
service, which were enjoyed at other
times. As there was not time to enlist the
soldiers in the regular manner, the magistrate
who was appointed to command the
army displayed two banners (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vexilla</i>) from
the Capitol, one red, to summon the infantry,
and the other green, to summon the cavalry,
and said, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui rempublicam salvam vult, me
sequatur</i>. Those that assembled took the
military oath together, instead of one by one,
as was the usual practice, whence they were
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conjurati</i>, and their service <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conjuratio</i>.
Soldiers enlisted in this way were termed
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tumultuarii</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Subitarii</i>.</p>

<p id="Tunica">TŬNĬCA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χιτών</span>, <em>dim.</em> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χιτωνίσκος, χιτώνιον</span>),
an under-garment. (1) <span class="smcap">Greek.</span> The
chiton was the only kind of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔνδυμα</span>, or under-garment
worn by the Greeks. Of this there
were two kinds, the Dorian and Ionian. The
Dorian chiton, as worn by males, was a
short woollen shirt, without sleeves; the
Ionian was a long linen garment, with sleeves.
The former seems to have been originally
worn throughout the whole of Greece; the
latter was brought over to Greece by the
Ionians of Asia. The Ionic chiton was commonly
worn at Athens by men during the
Persian wars, but it appears to have entirely
gone out of fashion for the male sex about the
time of Pericles, from which time the Dorian
chiton was the under-garment universally
adopted by men through the whole of Greece.
The distinction between the Doric and Ionic
chiton still continued in the dress of women.
The Spartan virgins only wore this one garment,
and had no upper kind of clothing,
whence it is sometimes called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Himation</i>
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pallium">Pallium</a></span>] as well as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chiton</i>. They appeared
in the company of men without any further
covering; but the married women never did
so without wearing an upper garment. This
Doric chiton was made, as stated above, of
woollen stuff; it was without sleeves, and
was fastened over both shoulders by clasps or
buckles (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόρπαι</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περόναι</span>), which were often
of considerable size. It was frequently so
short as not to reach the knee. It was
only joined together on one side, and on
the other was left partly open or slit up
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σχιστός χίτων</span>), to allow a free motion of the
limbs. The following cut represents an
Amazon with a chiton of this kind: some
parts of the figure appear incomplete, as the
original is mutilated. The Ionic chiton, on
the contrary, was a long and loose garment,
reaching to the feet (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποδήρης</span>), with wide
sleeves (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόραι</span>), and was usually made of
linen. The sleeves, however, appear generally
to have covered only the upper part of
the arm; for in ancient works of art we
seldom find the sleeve extending farther
than the elbow, and sometimes not so far.
The sleeves were sometimes slit up, and
fastened together with an elegant row of
brooches. The Ionic chiton, according to
Herodotus, was originally a Carian dress,
and passed over to Athens from Ionia, as has
been already remarked. The women at
Athens originally wore the Doric chiton, but
were compelled to change it for the Ionic,
after they had killed with the buckles or
clasps of their dresses the single Athenian
who had returned alive from the expedition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
against Aegina, because there were no buckles
or clasps required in the Ionic dress. The
preceding cut represents the Muse Thalia
wearing an Ionic chiton. The peplum has
fallen off her shoulders, and is held up by
the left hand. Both kinds of dress were fastened
round the middle with a girdle, and as
the Ionic chiton was usually longer than the
body, part of it was drawn up so that the
dress might not reach farther than the feet,
and the part which was so drawn up overhung
or overlapped the girdle, and was called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόλπος</span>.&mdash;There was a peculiar kind of dress,
which seems to have been a species of
double chiton, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diplois</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διπλοΐς</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diploidion</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διπλοΐδιον</span>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemidiploidion</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἡμιδιπλοΐδιον</span>).</p>

</div>

<p>It appears not to have been a
separate article of dress, but merely the
upper part of the cloth forming the chiton,
which was larger than was required for the
ordinary chiton, and was therefore thrown
over the front and back. The following cuts
will give a clearer idea of the form of this
garment than any description. Since the
Diploidion was fastened over the shoulders
by means of buckles or clasps, it was called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epomis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπωμίς</span>), which is supposed by some
writers to have been only the end of the garment
fastened on the shoulder. The chiton
was worn by men next their skin; but
females were accustomed to wear a chemise
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χιτώνιον</span>) under their chiton. It was the
practice among most of the Greeks to wear
an himation, or outer garment, over the
chiton, but frequently the chiton was worn
alone. A person who wore only a chiton
was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μονοχίτων</span> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰοχίτων</span> in Homer), an
epithet given to the Spartan virgins. In the
some way, a person who wore only an himation,
or outer garment, was called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀχίτων</span>.
The Athenian youths, in the earlier times,
wore only the chiton, and when it became
the fashion, in the Peloponnesian war, to
wear an outer garment over it, it was regarded
as a mark of effeminacy.&mdash;(2) <span class="smcap">Roman.</span>
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tunica</i> of the Romans, like the
Greek chiton, was a woollen under-garment,
over which the toga was worn. It was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Indumentum</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Indutus</i>, as opposed to the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amictus</i>, the general term for the toga, pallium,
or any other outer garment. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amictus">Amictus</a>.</span>]
The Romans are said to have had no
other clothing originally but the toga; and
when the tunic was first introduced, it was
merely a short garment without sleeves, and
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colobium</i>. It was considered a
mark of effeminacy for men to wear tunics
with long sleeves (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">manicatae</i>) and reaching
to the feet (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">talares</i>). The tunic was girded
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cincta</i>) with a belt or girdle around the
waist, but it was usually worn loose, without
being girded, when a person was at home,
or wished to be at his ease. Hence we find
the terms <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinctus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praecinctus</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">succinctus</i>,
applied, like the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὔζωνος</span>, to an active
and diligent person, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discinctus</i> to one
who was idle or dissolute. The form of the
tunic, as worn by men, is represented in
many woodcuts in this work. In works of
art it usually terminates a little above the
knee; it has short sleeves, covering only the
upper part of the arm, and is girded at the
waist: the sleeves sometimes, though less frequently,
extend to the hands.&mdash;Both sexes at
Rome usually wore two tunics, an outer and an
under, the latter of which was worn next the
skin, and corresponds to our shirt and chemise.
The under tunics were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Subucula</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Indusium</i>,
the former of which is supposed to be
the name of the under tunic of the men, and
the latter of that of the women: but this is
not certain. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Interula</i> was of later
origin, and seems to have been applied
equally to the under tunic of both sexes. It
is doubtful whether the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Supparus</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Supparum</i>
was an outer or an under garment.
Persons sometimes wore several tunics, as a
protection against cold: Augustus wore four
in the winter, besides a subucula. As the
dress of a man usually consisted of an under
tunic, an outer tunic, and the toga, so that
of a woman, in like manner, consisted of an
under tunic, an outer tunic, and the palla.
The outer tunic of the Roman matron was
properly called stola [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Stola">Stola</a></span>], and is represented
in the woodcut on <a href="#ill355">p. 355</a>; but the
annexed woodcut, which represents a Roman
empress in the character of Concordia, or
Abundantia, gives a better idea of its form.
Over the tunic or stola the palla is thrown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
in many folds, but the shape of the former is
still distinctly shown. The tunics of women
were larger and longer than those of men,
and always had sleeves; but in ancient
paintings and statues we seldom find the
sleeves covering more than the upper part of
the arm. Sometimes the tunics were adorned
with golden ornaments called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leria</i>. Poor
people, who could not afford to purchase a
toga, wore the tunic alone, whence we find
the common people called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tunicati</i>. A person
who wore only his tunic was frequently
called <span class="smcap"><a href="#Nudus">Nudus</a></span>. Respecting the clavus latus
and the clavus angustus, worn on the tunics
of the senators and equites respectively, see
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Clavus_l">Clavus Latus</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#Clavus_l">Clavus Angustus</a></span>. When a
triumph was celebrated, the conqueror wore,
together with an embroidered toga (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Toga
picta</i>), a flowered tunic (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tunica palmata</i>),
also called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tunica Jovis</i>, because it was taken
from the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Tunics
of this kind were sent as presents to
foreign kings by the senate.</p>

<p id="Turibulum">TŪRĬBŬLUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θυμιατήριον</span>), a censer. The
Greeks and Romans, when they sacrificed,
commonly took a little frankincense out of
the <span class="smcap"><a href="#Acerra">Acerra</a></span> and let it fall upon the flaming
altar. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ara">Ara</a>.</span>] More rarely they used a censer,
by means of which they burnt the incense
in greater profusion, and which was in fact
a small moveable grate or <span class="smcap"><a href="#Focus">Foculus</a></span>. The annexed
cut shows the performance of both of
these acts at the same time. Winckelmann
supposes it to represent Livia, the wife, and
Octavia, the sister of Augustus, sacrificing to
Mars in gratitude for his safe return from
Spain. The censer here represented has two
handles for the purpose of carrying it from
place to place, and it stands upon feet so that
the air might be admitted underneath, and
pass upwards through the fuel.</p>

<p id="Turris">TURRIS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πύργος</span>), a tower. Moveable
towers were among the most important engines
used in storming a fortified place. They
were generally made of beams and planks,
and covered, at least on the three sides which
were exposed to the besieged, with iron, not
only for protection, but also to increase their
weight, and thus make them steadier. They
were also covered with raw hides and quilts,
moistened, and sometimes with alum, to protect
them from fire. Their height was such
as to overtop the walls, towers, and all other
fortifications of the besieged place. They
were divided into stories (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulata</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tecta</i>),
and hence they are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">turres contabulatae</i>.
The sides of the towers were pierced with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
windows, of which there were several to each
story. The use of the stories was to receive
the engines of war (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tormenta</i>). They contained
balistae and catapults, and slingers and
archers were stationed in them, and on the
tops of the towers. In the lowest story was
a battering-ram [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aries">Aries</a></span>]; and in the middle
one or more bridges (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pontes</i>) made of beams
and planks, and protected at the sides by
hurdles. Scaling-ladders (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalae</i>) were also
carried in the towers, and when the missiles
had cleared the walls, these bridges and ladders
enabled the besiegers to rush upon them.
These towers were placed upon wheels (generally
6 or 8), that they might be brought up
to the walls. These wheels were placed for
security inside of the tower.</p>

with bells. Others presented a flat circular
disk on the upper surface and swelled out
beneath like a kettle-drum. Both forms are
represented in the cuts below. Tympana
were covered with the hides of oxen, or of
asses; were beaten with a stick, or with the
hand, and were much employed in all wild
enthusiastic religious rites, especially the
orgies of Bacchus and Cybele.&mdash;(2) A solid

<p id="Tyrannus">TỸRANNUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τύραννος</span>). In the heroic
age all the governments in Greece were monarchical,
the king uniting in himself the
functions of the priest, the judge, and military
chief. In the first two or three centuries
following the Trojan war various
causes were at work, which led to the abolition,
or at least to the limitation, of the
kingly power. Emigrations, extinctions of
families, disasters in war, civil dissensions,
may be reckoned among these causes. Hereditary
monarchies became elective; the different
functions of the king were distributed;
he was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archon</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄρχων</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cosmus</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</span>),
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prytanis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πρύτανις</span>), instead of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Basileus</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βασιλεύς</span>), and his character was
changed no less than his name. Noble and
wealthy families began to be considered on a
footing of equality with royalty; and thus in
process of time sprang up oligarchies or aristocracies,
which most of the governments that
succeeded the ancient monarchies were in
point of fact, though not as yet called by
such names. These oligarchies did not possess
the elements of social happiness or
stability. The principal families contended
with each other for the greatest share of
power, and were only unanimous in disregarding
the rights of those whose station
was beneath their own. The people, oppressed
by the privileged classes, began to
regret the loss of their old paternal form of
government; and were ready to assist any
one who would attempt to restore it. Thus
were opportunities offered to ambitious and
designing men to raise themselves, by starting
up as the champions of popular right.
Discontented nobles were soon found to prosecute
schemes of this sort, and they had a
greater chance of success, if descended from
the ancient royal family. Pisistratus is an
example; he was the more acceptable to the
people of Athens, as being a descendant of
the family of Codrus. Thus in many cities
arose that species of monarchy which the
Greeks called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tyrannis</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τυραννίς</span>), which
meant only <em>a despotism</em>, or irresponsible
dominion of one man; and which frequently
was nothing more than a revival of the ancient
government, and, though unaccompanied
with any recognised hereditary title,
or the reverence attached to old name and
long prescription, was hailed by the lower
orders of people as a good exchange, after suffering
under the domination of the oligarchy.
All <em>tyrannies</em>, however, were not so acceptable
to the majority; and sometimes we find
the nobles concurring in the elevation of a
despot, to further their own interests. Thus
the Syracusan <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gamori</i>, who had been expelled
by the populace, on receiving the
protection of Gelon, sovereign of Gela and
Camarina, enabled him to take possession of
Syracuse, and establish his kingdom there.
Sometimes the conflicting parties in the
state, by mutual consent, chose some eminent
man, in whom they had confidence, to
reconcile their dissensions; investing him
with a sort of dictatorial power for that purpose,
either for a limited period or otherwise.
Such a person they called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aesymnetes</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰσυμνήτης</span>).
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tyrannus</i> must be distinguished,
on the one hand, from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aesymnetes</i>, inasmuch
as he was not elected by general consent,
but commonly owed his elevation to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
some violent movement or stratagem, such
as the creation of a body-guard for him by
the people, or the seizure of the citadel; and
on the other hand, from the ancient king,
whose right depended, not on usurpation,
but on inheritance and traditionary acknowledgment.
The power of a king might be
more absolute than that of a <em>tyrant</em>; as
Phidon of Argos is said to have made the
royal prerogative greater than it was under
his predecessors; yet he was still regarded as
a king; for the difference between the two
names depended on title and origin, and not
on the manner in which the power was exercised.
The name of <em>tyrant</em> was originally
so far from denoting a person who abused
his power, or treated his subjects with
cruelty, that Pisistratus is praised for the
moderation of his government. Afterwards,
when <em>tyrants</em> themselves had become odious,
the name also grew to be a word of reproach,
just as <em>rex</em> did among the Romans. Among
the early <em>tyrants</em> of Greece those most
worthy of mention are: Clisthenes of Sicyon,
grandfather of the Athenian Clisthenes, in
whose family the government continued for
a century since its establishment by Orthagoras,
about <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 672; Cypselus of Corinth,
who expelled the Bacchiadae, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 656, and
his son Periander, both remarkable for their
cruelty; their dynasty lasted between seventy
and eighty years; Procles of Epidaurus;
Pantaleon of Pisa, who celebrated the thirty-fourth
Olympiad, depriving the Eleans of
the presidency; Theagenes of Megara, father-in-law
to Cylon the Athenian; Pisistratus,
whose sons were the last of the early <em>tyrants</em>
on the Grecian continent. In Sicily, where
<em>tyranny</em> most flourished, the principal were
Phalaris of Agrigentum, who established his
power in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 568; Theron of Agrigentum;
Gelon, already mentioned, who, in conjunction
with Theron, defeated Hamilcar the
Carthaginian, on the same day on which the
battle of Salamis was fought; and Hieron,
his brother: the last three celebrated by
Pindar. The following also are worthy of
notice: Polycrates of Samos; Lygdamis of
Naxos; Histiaeus and Aristagoras of Miletus.
Perhaps the last mentioned can hardly
be classed among the <em>Greek tyrants</em>, as they
were connected with the Persian monarchy.
The general characteristics of a <em>tyranny</em> were,
that it was bound by no laws, and had no
recognised limitation to its authority, however
it might be restrained <em>in practice</em> by the
good disposition of the <em>tyrant</em> himself, or by
fear, or by the spirit of the age. It was
commonly most odious to the wealthy and
noble, whom the <em>tyrant</em> looked upon with
jealousy as a check upon his power, and
whom he often sought to get rid of by sending
them into exile or putting them to death.
The <em>tyrant</em> usually kept a body-guard of
foreign mercenaries, by aid of whom he controlled
the people at home; but he seldom
ventured to make war, for fear of giving an
opportunity to his subjects to revolt. The
causes which led to the decline of <em>tyranny</em>
among the Greeks were partly the degeneracy
of the <em>tyrants</em> themselves, corrupted by
power, indolence, flattery, and bad education;
for even where the father set a good
example, it was seldom followed by the son;
partly the cruelties and excesses of particular
men, which brought them all into disrepute;
and partly the growing spirit of inquiry
among the Greek people, who began to speculate
upon political theories, and soon became
discontented with a form of government,
which had nothing in theory, and
little in practice, to recommend it. Few
dynasties lasted beyond the third generation.
Most of the tyrannies, which flourished before
the Persian war, are said to have been
overthrown by the exertions of Sparta, jealous,
probably, of any innovation upon the
old Doric constitution, especially of any tendency
to ameliorate the condition of the Periocci,
and anxious to extend her own influence
over the states of Greece by means of
the benefits which she conferred. Upon the
fall of <em>tyranny</em>, the various republican forms
of government were established, the Dorian
states generally favouring oligarchy, the
Ionian democracy. Of the tyrants of a later
period, the most celebrated are the two
Dionysii. The corruption of the Syracusans,
their intestine discords, and the fear of the
Carthaginian invaders, led to the appointment
of Dionysius to the chief military command,
with unlimited powers; by means of
which he raised himself to the throne, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
406, and reigned for 38 years, leaving his son
to succeed him. The younger Dionysius, far
inferior in every respect to his father, was

Greek and Roman ladies as a protection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
against the sun. They seem not to have
been carried generally by the ladies themselves,
but by female slaves, who held them
over their mistresses. The daughters of the
aliens (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέτοικοι</span>) at Athens had to carry parasols
after the Athenian maidens at the Panathenaea,
as is mentioned under <span class="smcap"><a href="#Hydriaphoria">Hydriaphoria</a></span>.
The parasols of the ancients seem
to have been exactly like our own parasols
or umbrellas in form, and could be shut up
and opened like ours. It was considered a
mark of effeminacy for men to make use of
parasols. The Roman ladies used them in
the amphitheatre to defend themselves from
the sun or some passing shower, when the
wind or other circumstances did not allow
the velarium to be extended. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amphitheatrum">Amphitheatrum</a>.</span>]
To hold a parasol over a lady was
one of the common attentions of lovers, and
it seems to have been very common to give
parasols as presents. Instead of parasols, the
Greek women in later times wore a kind of
straw hat or bonnet, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tholia</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θολία</span>).
The Romans also wore a hat with a broad
brim (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">petasus</i>) as a protection against the sun.</p>

from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unus</i>, as being the unit of the divisions
of the as. Its value as a weight was 433·666
grains, or ¾ of an ounce and 105·36 grains
avoirdupois. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Libra">Libra</a>.</span>] In connecting the
Roman system of weights and money with
the Greek another division of the uncia was
used. When the drachma was introduced
into the Roman system as equivalent to the
denarius of 96 to the pound [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Denarius">Denarius</a></span>;
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Drachma">Drachma</a></span>], the uncia contained 8 drachmae,
the drachma 3 scrupula, the scrupulum 2
oboli (since 6 oboli made up the drachma),
and the obolos 3 siliquae (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κερατία</span>). In this
division we have the origin of the modern
Italian system, in which the pound is divided
into 12 ounces, the ounce into 3 drams, the
dram into 3 scruples, and the scruple into
6 carats. In each of these systems 1728
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κερατία</span>, siliquae, or carats, make up the
pound. The Romans applied the uncial division
to all kinds of magnitude. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#As">As</a>.</span>] In

But although their original object
was simply to preserve the health and elasticity
of the human frame, they were in later
times used as articles of luxury. They were
then not only employed to impart to the body
or hair a particular colour, but also to give
to them the most beautiful fragrance possible;
they were, moreover, not merely applied
after a bath, but at any time, to render
one’s appearance or presence more pleasant
than usual. In short, they were used then
as oils and pomatums are at present. At
Rome these luxuries did not become very
general till towards the end of the republic,
while the Greeks appear to have been familiar
with them from early times. The wealthy
Greeks and Romans carried their ointments
and perfumes with them, especially when
they bathed, in small boxes of costly materials
and beautiful workmanship, which
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narthecia</i>. The traffic which
was carried on in these ointments and perfumes
in several towns of Greece and southern
Italy was very considerable. The persons
engaged in manufacturing them were called
by the Romans <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentarii</i>, or, as they frequently
were women, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentariae</i>, and the
art of manufacturing them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unguentaria</i>. In
the wealthy and effeminate city of Capua

<p id="Vallum">VALLUM, a term applied either to the
whole or a portion of the fortifications of a
Roman camp. It is derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallus</i> (a
stake), and properly means the palisade which
ran along the outer edge of the agger, but it
very frequently includes the agger also. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallum</i>, in the latter sense, together with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fossa</i> or ditch which surrounded the camp
outside of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallum</i>, formed a complete fortification.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">valli</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χάρακες</span>), of which the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallum</i>, in the former and more limited sense,
was composed, are described by Polybius and
Livy, who make a comparison between the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallum</i> of the Greeks and that of the Romans,
very much to the advantage of the latter.
Both used for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">valli</i> young trees or arms of
larger trees, with the side branches on them;
but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">valli</i> of the Greeks were much larger
and had more branches than those of the
Romans, which had either two or three, or at
the most four branches, and these generally
on the same side. The Greeks placed their
valli in the agger at considerable intervals,
the spaces between them being filled up by
the branches; the Romans fixed theirs close
together, and made the branches interlace,
and sharpened their points carefully. Hence
the Greek vallus could easily be taken hold of
by its large branches and pulled from its
place, and when it was removed a large opening
was left in the vallum. The Roman
vallus, on the contrary, presented no convenient
handle, required very great force to
pull it down, and even if removed left a very
small opening. The Greek valli were cut on
the spot; the Romans prepared theirs beforehand,
and each soldier carried three or four
of them when on a march. They were made
of any strong wood, but oak was preferred.
The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallus</i> is sometimes used as equivalent
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vallum</i>. In the operations of a siege,
when the place could not be taken by storm,
and it became necessary to establish a blockade,
this was done by drawing defences similar
to those of a camp round the town, which
was then said to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circumvallatum</i>. Such
a circumvallation, besides cutting off all communication
between the town and the surrounding
country, formed a defence against
the sallies of the besieged. There was often
a double line of fortifications, the inner
against the town, and the outer against a
force that might attempt to raise the siege.
In this case the army was encamped between
the two lines of works. This kind of circumvallation,
which the Greeks called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀποτειχισμός</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περιτειχισμός</span>, was employed by the
Peloponnesians in the siege of Plataeae.
Their lines consisted of two walls (apparently
of turf) at the distance of 16 feet,
which surrounded the city in the form of a
circle. Between the walls were the huts of
the besiegers. The wall had battlements
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπάλξεις</span>), and at every tenth battlement was
a tower, filling up by its depth the whole
space between the walls. There was a passage
for the besiegers through the middle of
each tower. On the outside of each wall was
a ditch (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τάφρος</span>). This description would
almost exactly answer to the Roman mode of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
circumvallation, of which some of the best
examples are that of Carthage by Scipio, that of
Numantia by Scipio, and that of Alesia by Caesar.
The towers in such lines were similar to
those used in attacking fortified places, but not
so high, and of course not moveable. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Turris">Turris</a>.</span>]</p>

mixed with chaff was received after thrashing,
and was then thrown in the direction of
the wind. Virgil dignifies this simple implement
by calling it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mystica vannus Iacchi</i>.
The rites of Bacchus, as well as those of
Ceres, having a continual reference to the
occupations of rural life, the vannus was
borne in the processions celebrated in honour
of both these divinities. In the cut annexed
the infant Bacchus is carried in a vannus by
two dancing bacchantes clothed in skins.</p>

The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vas</i> was used in a still wider signification,
and was applied to any kind of
utensil used in the kitchen, agriculture, &amp;c.
The utensils of the soldiers were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vasa</i>,

<p id="Vectigalia">VECTĪGĀLĬA, the general term for all the
regular revenues of the Roman state. It
means anything which is brought (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vehitur</i>)
into the public treasury, like the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φόρος</span>.
The earliest regular income of the state was
in all probability the rent paid for the use of
the public land and pastures. This revenue
was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pascua</i>, a name which was used as
late as the time of Pliny, in the tables or
registers of the censors for all the revenues of
the state in general. The senate was the
supreme authority in all matters of finance,
but as the state did not occupy itself with
collecting the taxes, duties, and tributes,
the censors were entrusted with the actual
business. These officers, who in this respect
may not unjustly be compared to modern
ministers of finance, used to let the various
branches of the revenue to the publicani for a
fixed sum, and for a certain number of years.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Censor">Censor</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Publicani">Publicani</a></span>.] As most of the
branches of the public revenues of Rome are
treated of in separate articles, it is only necessary
to give a list of them here, and to explain
those which have not been treated of
separately. 1. The tithes paid to the state
by those who occupied the ager publicus.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Decumae">Decumae</a></span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#Ager">Ager Publicus</a></span>.] 2. The sums
paid by those who kept their cattle on the
public pastures. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Scriptura">Scriptura</a>.</span>] 3. The harbour
duties raised upon imported and exported
commodities. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Portorium">Portorium</a>.</span>] 4. The
revenue derived from the salt-works. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Salinae">Salinae</a>.</span>]
5. The revenues derived from the
mines (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">metalla</i>). This branch of the public
revenue cannot have been very productive
until the Romans had become masters of
foreign countries. Until that time the mines
of Italy appear to have been worked, but this
was forbidden by the senate after the conquest
of foreign lands. The mines of conquered
countries were treated like the salinae.
6. The hundredth part of the value of all
things which were sold (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">centesima rerum venalium</i>).
This tax was not instituted at
Rome until the time of the civil wars; the
persons who collected it were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coactores</i>.
Tiberius reduced this tax to a two-hundredth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ducentesima</i>), and Caligula abolished it for
Italy altogether, whence upon several coins
of this emperor we read <span class="allsmcap">R. C. C.</span>, that is,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Remissa Ducentesima</i>. Respecting the tax
raised upon the sale of slaves, see <span class="smcap">Quinquagesima</span>.
7. The vicesima hereditatum et
manumissionum. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Vicesima">Vicesima</a>.</span>] 8. The tribute
imposed upon foreign countries was by
far the most important branch of the public
revenue during the time of Rome’s greatness.
It was sometimes raised at once, sometimes
paid by instalments, and sometimes changed
into a poll-tax, which was in many cases
regulated according to the census. In regard
to Cilicia and Syria we know that this tax
amounted to one per cent. of a person’s census,
to which a tax upon houses and slaves
was added. In some cases the tribute was
not paid according to the census, but consisted
in a land-tax. 9. A tax upon bachelors.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Aes_u">Aes Uxorium</a>.</span>] 10. A door-tax.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Ostiarium">Ostiarium</a>.</span>] 11. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">octavae</i>. In the time
of Caesar all liberti living in Italy, and possessing
property of 200 sestertia, and above
it, had to pay a tax consisting of the eighth
part of their property.&mdash;It would be interesting
to ascertain the amount of income which
Rome at various periods derived from these
and other sources; but our want of information
renders it impossible. We have only the
general statement, that previously to the time
of Pompey the annual revenue amounted to
fifty millions of drachmas, and that it was
increased by him to eighty-five millions.</p>

<p id="Venabulum">VĒNĀBŬLUM, a hunting-spear. This
may have been distinguished from the spears
used in warfare by being barbed; at least it
is often so formed in ancient works of art.
It was seldom, if ever, thrown, but held so as
to slant downwards and to receive the attacks
of the wild boars and other beasts of chace.</p>


<p id="Venatio">VĒNĀTĬO, hunting, was the name given
among the Romans to an exhibition of wild
beasts, which fought with one another and
with men. These exhibitions originally
formed part of the games of the circus. Julius
Caesar first built a wooden amphitheatre
for the exhibition of wild beasts, and others
were subsequently erected; but we frequently
read of venationes in the circus in subsequent
times. The persons who fought with the
beasts were either condemned criminals or
captives, or individuals who did so for the
sake of pay, and were trained for the purpose.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Bestiarii">Bestiarii</a>.</span>] The Romans were as passionately
fond of this entertainment as of the exhibitions
of gladiators, and during the latter
days of the republic, and under the empire,
an immense variety of animals was collected
from all parts of the Roman world for the
gratification of the people, and many thousands
were frequently slain at one time. We
do not know on what occasion a venatio was
first exhibited at Rome; but the first mention
we find of any thing of the kind is in
the year <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 251, when L. Metellus exhibited
in the circus 142 elephants, which he had
brought from Sicily after his victory over the
Carthaginians. But this can scarcely be regarded
as an instance of a venatio, as it was
understood in later times, since the elephants
are said to have been only killed because the
Romans did not know what to do with them,
and not for the amusement of the people.
There was, however, a venatio in the later
sense of the word in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 186, in the games
celebrated by M. Fulvius in fulfilment of the
vow which he had made in the Aetolian war; in
these games lions and panthers were exhibited.
It is mentioned as a proof of the growing
magnificence of the age that in the ludi
circenses, exhibited by the curule aediles P.
Cornelius Scipio Nasica and P. Lentulus <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
168, there were 63 African panthers and
40 bears and elephants. From about this
time combats with wild beasts probably
formed a regular part of the ludi circenses,
and many of the curule aediles made great
efforts to obtain rare and curious animals,
and put in requisition the services of their
friends. Elephants are said to have first
fought in the circus in the curule aedileship
of Claudius Pulcher, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 99; and twenty
years afterwards, in the curule aedileship of
the two Luculli, they fought against bulls.
A hundred lions were exhibited by Sulla in
his praetorship, which were destroyed by
javelin-men sent by king Bocchus for the purpose.
This was the first time that lions were
allowed to be loose in the circus; they were
previously always tied up. The games, however,
in the curule aedileship of Scaurus,
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 58, surpassed anything the Romans had
ever seen; among other novelties, he first
exhibited an hippopotamos and five crocodiles
in a temporary canal or trench (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">euripus</i>). At
the venatio given by Pompey in his second
consulship, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 55, upon the dedication of
the temple of Venus Victrix, there was an
immense number of animals slaughtered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
among which we find mention of 600 lions,
and 18 or 20 elephants; the latter fought
with Gaetulians, who hurled darts against
them, and they attempted to break through
the railings (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">clathri</i>) by which they were
separated from the spectators. To guard
against this danger Julius Caesar surrounded
the arena of the amphitheatre with trenches
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">euripi</i>). In the games exhibited by J. Caesar
in his third consulship, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 45, the venatio
lasted for five days, and was conducted with
extraordinary splendour. Cameleopards or
giraffes were then for the first time seen in
Italy. The venationes seem to have been
first confined to the ludi circenses, but during
the later times of the republic, and under the
empire, they were frequently exhibited on
the celebration of triumphs, and on many
other occasions, with the view of pleasing the
people. The passion for these shows continued
to increase under the empire, and the
number of beasts sometimes slaughtered seems
almost incredible. Under the emperors we
read of a particular kind of venatio, in which
the beasts were not killed by bestiarii, but
were given up to the people, who were allowed
to rush into the area of the circus and
carry away what they pleased. On such occasions
a number of large trees, which had
been torn up by the roots, was planted in the
circus, which thus resembled a forest, and
none of the more savage animals were admitted
into it. One of the most extraordinary
venationes of this kind was that given by
Probus, in which there were 1000 ostriches,
1000 stags, 1000 boars, 1000 deer, and numbers
of wild goats, wild sheep, and other
animals of the same kind. The more savage
animals were slain by the bestiarii in the
amphitheatre, and not in the circus. Thus,
in the day succeeding the venatio of Probus
just mentioned, there were slain in the amphitheatre
100 lions and 100 lionesses, 100
Libyan and 100 Syrian leopards, and 300 bears.</p>

<p id="Veneficium">VĔNĒFĬCĬUM, the crime of poisoning, is
frequently mentioned in Roman history.
Women were most addicted to it: but it
seems not improbable that this charge was
frequently brought against females without
sufficient evidence of their guilt, like that of
witchcraft in Europe in the middle ages.
We find females condemned to death for this
crime in seasons of pestilence, when the people
are always in an excited state of mind,
and ready to attribute the calamities under
which they suffer to the arts of evil-disposed
persons. Thus the Athenians, when the
pestilence raged in their city during the Peloponnesian
war, supposed the wells to have
been poisoned by the Peloponnesians, and
similar instances occur in the history of
almost all states. Still, however, the crime
of poisoning seems to have been much more
frequent in ancient than in modern times;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
and this circumstance would lead persons to
suspect it in cases when there was no real
ground for the suspicion. At Athens the
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Pharmacon">Pharmacon Graphe</a></span> was brought against
poisoners. At Rome the first legislative
enactment especially directed against poisoning
was a law of the dictator Sulla&mdash;Lex
Cornelia de Sicariis et Veneficis&mdash;passed in
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 82, which continued in force, with some
alterations, to the latest times. It contained
provisions against all who made,
bought, sold, possessed, or gave poison for
the purpose of poisoning. The punishment
fixed by this law was the interdictio aquae et
ignis.</p>


<p id="Ver">VER SACRUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἔτος ἱερόν</span>). It was a
custom among the early Italian nations,
especially among the Sabines, in times of
great danger and distress, to vow to the deity
the sacrifice of everything born in the next
spring, that is, between the first of March
and the last day of April, if the calamity
under which they were labouring should be
removed. This sacrifice in the early times
comprehended both men and domestic animals,
and there is little doubt that in many
cases the vow was really carried into effect.
But in later times it was thought cruel to
sacrifice so many infants, and accordingly
the following expedient was adopted. The
children were allowed to grow up, and in the
spring of their twentieth or twenty-first year
they were with covered faces driven across
the frontier of their native country, whereupon
they went whithersoever fortune or
the deity might lead them. Many a colony
had been founded by persons driven out in
this manner; and the Mamertines in Sicily
were the descendants of such devoted persons.
In the two historical instances in
which the Romans vowed a ver sacrum,
that is, after the battle of lake Trasimenus
and at the close of the second Punic war, the
vow was confined to domestic animals.</p>

<p id="Vestales">VESTĀLES, the virgin priestesses of Vesta,
who ministered in her temple and watched
the eternal fire. Their existence at Alba
Longa is connected with the earliest Roman
traditions, for Silvia the mother of Romulus
was a member of the sisterhood; their establishment
in the city, in common with
almost all other matters connected with state
religion, is generally ascribed to Numa, who
selected four, two from the Titienses and two
from the Ramnes; and two more were subsequently
added from the Luceres, by Tarquinius
Priscus according to one authority,
by Servius Tullius according to another.
This number of six remained unchanged to
the latest times. They were originally
chosen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capere</i> is the technical word) by the
king, and during the republic and empire by
the pontifex maximus. It was necessary
that the maiden should not be under six nor
above ten years of age, perfect in all her
limbs, in the full enjoyment of all her senses,
patrima et matrima [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Patrimi">Patrimi</a></span>], the daughter
of free and freeborn parents who had never
been in slavery, who followed no dishonourable
occupation, and whose home was in
Italy. The Lex Papia ordained that when a
vacancy occurred the pontifex maximus
should name at his discretion twenty qualified
damsels, one of whom was publicly (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
concione</i>) fixed upon by lot, an exemption
being granted in favour of such as had a
sister already a vestal, and of the daughters
of certain priests of a high class. The above
law appears to have been enacted in consequence
of the unwillingness of fathers to
resign all control over a child, and this reluctance
was manifested so strongly in later
times, that in the age of Augustus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">libertinae</i>
were declared eligible. The casting of lots
moreover does not seem to have been practised
if any respectable person came forward
voluntarily, and offered a daughter who fulfilled
the necessary conditions. As soon as
the election was concluded, the pontifex
maximus took the girl by the hand and addressed
her in a solemn form. After this was
pronounced she was led away to the atrium
of Vesta, and lived thenceforward within the
sacred precincts, under the special superintendence
and control of the pontifical college.
The period of service lasted for thirty years.
During the first ten the priestess was engaged
in learning her mysterious duties, being
termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discipula</i>, during the next ten in
performing them, during the last ten in
giving instructions to the novices, and so
long as she was thus employed she was bound
by a solemn vow of chastity. But after the
time specified was completed, she might, if
she thought fit, throw off the emblems of her
office, unconsecrate herself (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">exaugurare</i>), return
to the world, and even enter into the
marriage state. Few however availed themselves
of these privileges; those who did
were said to have lived in sorrow and remorse
(as might indeed have been expected
from the habits they had formed); hence
such a proceeding was considered ominous,
and the priestesses for the most part died, as
they had lived, in the service of the goddess.
The senior sister was entitled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vestalis Maxima</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virgo Maxima</i>, and we find also the
expressions <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vestalium vetustissima</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tres
maximae</i>. Their chief office was to watch
by turns, night and day, the everlasting fire
which blazed upon the altar of Vesta, its
extinction being considered as the most fearful
of all prodigies, and emblematic of the
extinction of the state. If such misfortune
befell, and was caused by the carelessness of
the priestess on duty, she was stripped and
scourged by the pontifex maximus, in the
dark and with a screen interposed, and he
rekindled the flame by the friction of two
pieces of wood from a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">felix arbor</i>. Their
other ordinary duties consisted in presenting
offerings to the goddess at stated times, and
in sprinkling and purifying the shrine each
morning with water, which according to the
institution of Numa was to be drawn from
the Egerian fount, although in later times it
was considered lawful to employ any water
from a living spring or running stream,
but not such as had passed through pipes.
When used for sacrificial purposes it was
mixed with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">muries</i>, that is, salt which had
been pounded in a mortar, thrown into an
earthen jar, and baked in an oven. They
assisted moreover at all great public holy
rites, such as the festivals of the Bona Dea,
and the consecration of temples; they were
invited to priestly banquets, and we are told
that they were present at the solemn appeal
to the gods made by Cicero during the conspiracy
of Catiline. They also guarded the
sacred relics which formed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fatale pignus
imperii</i>, the pledge granted by fate for the
permanency of the Roman sway, deposited in
the inmost adytum, which no one was permitted
to enter save the virgins and the chief
pontifex. What this object was no one
knew; some supposed that it was the palladium,
others the Samothracian gods carried
by Dardanus to Troy, and transported from
thence to Italy by Aeneas, but all agreed in
believing that something of awful sanctity
was here preserved, contained, it was said,
in a small earthen jar closely sealed, while
another exactly similar in form, but empty,
stood by its side. We have seen above that
supreme importance was attached to the
purity of the vestals, and a terrible punishment
awaited her who violated the vow of
chastity. According to the law of Numa, she
was simply to be stoned to death, but a more
cruel torture was devised by Tarquinius
Priscus, and inflicted from that time forward.
When condemned by the college of pontifices,
she was stripped of her vittae and other
badges of office, was scourged, was attired
like a corpse, placed in a close litter and
borne through the forum attended by her
weeping kindred, with all the ceremonies of
a real funeral, to a rising ground called the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campus Sceleratus</i>, just within the city walls,
close to the Colline gate. There a small
vault underground had been previously prepared,
containing a couch, a lamp, and a
table with a little food. The pontifex maximus,
having lifted up his hands to heaven
and uttered a secret prayer, opened the litter,
led forth the culprit, and placing her on the
steps of the ladder which gave access to the
subterranean cell, delivered her over to the
common executioner and his assistants, who
conducted her down, drew up the ladder, and
having filled the pit with earth until the surface
was level with the surrounding ground,
left her to perish deprived of all the tributes
of respect usually paid to the spirits of the
departed. In every case the paramour was
publicly scourged to death in the forum.
The honours which the vestals enjoyed were
such as in a great measure to compensate for
their privations. They were maintained at
the public cost, and from sums of money and
land bequeathed from time to time to the
corporation. From the moment of their consecration
they became as it were the property
of the goddess alone, and were completely
released from all parental sway, without going
through the form of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">emancipatio</i> or suffering
any <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capitis deminutio</i>. They had a
right to make a will, and to give evidence in
a court of justice without taking an oath.
From the time of the triumviri each was
preceded by a lictor when she went abroad;
consuls and praetors made way for them,
and lowered their fasces; even the tribunes
of the plebs respected their holy character,
and if any one passed under their litter he
was put to death. Augustus granted to them
all the rights of matrons who had borne
three children, and assigned them a conspicuous
place in the theatre, a privilege
which they had enjoyed before at the gladiatorial
shows. Great weight was attached to
their intercession on behalf of those in danger
and difficulty, of which we have a remarkable
example in the entreaties which
they addressed to Sulla on behalf of Julius
Caesar, and if they chanced to meet a criminal
as he was led to punishment, they had a
right to demand his release, provided it could
be proved that the encounter was accidental.
Wills, even those of the emperors,
were committed to their charge, for when in
such keeping they were considered inviolable;
and in like manner very solemn
treaties, such as that of the triumvirs with
Sextus Pompeius, were placed in their hands.
That they might be honoured in death as in
life, their ashes were interred within the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
pomoerium. They were attired in a stola
over which was an upper vestment made of
linen, and in addition to the infula and white
woollen vitta, they wore when sacrificing a
peculiar head-dress called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suffibulum</i>, consisting
of a piece of white cloth bordered with
purple, oblong in shape, and secured by a
clasp. In dress and general deportment they
were required to observe the utmost simplicity
and decorum, any fanciful ornaments
in the one or levity in the other being always
regarded with disgust and suspicion. Their
hair was cut off, probably at the period of
their consecration: whether this was repeated
from time to time does not appear,
but they are never represented with flowing
locks. The following cut represents the
vestal Tuccia who, when wrongfully accused,
appealed to the goddess to vindicate her
honour, and had power given to her to carry
a sieve full of water from the Tiber to the
temple. The form of the upper garment is
well shown.</p>

<p id="Via">VIA, a public road. It was not until the
period of the long protracted Samnite wars
that the necessity was felt of securing a safe
communication between the city and the
legions, and then for the first time we hear
of those famous paved roads, which, in after
ages, connected Rome with her most distant
provinces, constituting the most lasting of
all her works. The excellence of the principles
upon which they were constructed is
sufficiently attested by their extraordinary
durability, many specimens being found in
the country around Rome which have been
used without being repaired for more than
a thousand years. The Romans are said to
have adopted their first ideas upon this
subject from the Carthaginians, and it is
extremely probable that the latter people
may, from their commercial activity and the
sandy nature of their soil, have been compelled
to turn their attention to the best
means of facilitating the conveyance of merchandise
to different parts of their territory.
The first great public road made by the
Romans was the Via Appia, which extended
in the first instance from Rome to Capua,
and was made in the censorship of Appius
Claudius Caecus (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 312.) The general construction
of a Roman road was as follows:&mdash;In
the first place, two shallow trenches (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sulci</i>)
were dug parallel to each other, marking
the breadth of the proposed road; this in
the great lines is found to have been from
13 to 15 feet. The loose earth between the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sulci</i> was then removed, and the excavation
continued until a solid foundation (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gremium</i>)
was reached, upon which the materials of
the road might firmly rest; if this could not
be attained, in consequence of the swampy
nature of the ground or from any peculiarity
in the soil, a basis was formed artificially by
driving piles (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fistucationibus</i>). Above the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gremium</i> were four distinct strata. The
lowest course was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">statumen</i>, consisting
of stones not smaller than the hand could
just grasp; above the statumen was the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rudus</i>, a mass of broken stones cemented
with lime, (what masons call <em>rubble-work</em>,)
rammed down hard, and nine inches thick;
above the rudus came the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nucleus</i>, composed
of fragments of bricks and pottery, the
pieces being smaller than in the rudus, cemented
with lime, and six inches thick.
Uppermost was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pavimentum</i>, large polygonal
blocks of the hardest stone (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silex</i>),
usually, at least in the vicinity of Rome,
basaltic lava, irregular in form, but fitted
and jointed with the greatest nicety, so as to
present a perfectly even surface, as free from
gaps or irregularities as if the whole had
been one solid mass. The general aspect
will be understood from the cut given below.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp67" id="ill413" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/ill413.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">Street at the entrance of Pompeii.</div>
</div>

<p>The centre of the way was a little elevated,
so as to permit the water to run off easily.
Occasionally, at least in cities, rectangular
slabs of softer stone were employed instead
of the irregular polygons of silex, and hence
the distinction between the phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">silice
sternere</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saxo quadrato sternere</i>. Nor
was this all. Regular foot-paths (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">margines</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crepidines</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">umbones</i>) were raised upon each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
side and strewed with gravel, the different
parts were strengthened and bound together
with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gomphi</i> or stone wedges, and stone
blocks were set up at moderate intervals on
the side of the foot-paths, in order that travellers
on horseback might be able to mount
without assistance. Finally, Caius Gracchus
erected mile-stones along the whole extent
of the great highways, marking the distances
from Rome, which appear to have been
counted from the gate at which each road
issued forth, and Augustus, when appointed
inspector of the viae around the city, erected
in the forum a gilded column (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">milliarium
aureum</i>), on which were inscribed the distances
of the principal points to which the
viae conducted. During the earlier ages of
the republic the construction and general
superintendence of the roads without, and
the streets within the city, were committed
like all other important works to the censors.
These duties, when no censors were in office,
devolved upon the consuls, and in their absence
on the praetor urbanus, the aediles, or
such persons as the senate thought fit to appoint.
There were also under the republic
four officers, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quatuorviri viarum</i>, for
superintending the streets within the city,
and two called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curatores viarum</i>, for superintending
the roads without. Under the
empire the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">curatores viarum</i> were officers of
high rank. The chief roads which issued
from Rome are:&mdash;1. The <span class="smcap">Via Appia</span>, the
<em>Great South Road</em>. It issued from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta
Capena</i>, and passing through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aricia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tres
Tabernae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Appii Forum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tarracina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fundi</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formiae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minturnae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sinuessa</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carilinum</i>,
terminated at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Capua</i>, but was eventually
extended through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calatia</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caudium</i>
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Beneventum</i>, and finally from thence
through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Venusia</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tarentum</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Uria</i>, to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brundusium</i>.&mdash;2. The <span class="smcap">Via Latina</span>, from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta Capena</i>, another great line leading to
Beneventum, but keeping a course farther
inland than the Via Appia. Soon after
leaving the city it sent off a short branch
(<span class="smcap">Via Tusculana</span>) to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tusculum</i>, and passing
through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Compitum Anaginum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ferentinum</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frusino</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fregellae</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fabrateria</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquinum</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Casinum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Venafrum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Teanum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Allifae</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Telesia</i>, joined the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Appia</i> at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Beneventum</i>.
A cross-road called the <span class="smcap">Via Hadriana</span>, running
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minturnae</i> through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Suessa Aurunca</i>
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Teanum</i>, connected the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Appia</i>
with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Latina</i>.&mdash;3. From the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta
Esquilina</i> issued the <span class="smcap">Via Labicana</span>, which
passing Labicum fell into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Latina</i> at
the station <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad Bivium</i>, 30 miles from Rome.&mdash;4.
The <span class="smcap">Via Praenestina</span>, originally the <span class="smcap">Via
Gabina</span>, issued from the same gate with the
former. Passing through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gabii</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Praeneste</i>,
it joined the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Latina</i> just below
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anagnia</i>.&mdash;5. The <span class="smcap">Via Tiburtina</span>, which
issued from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta Tiburtina</i>, and proceeding
N. E. to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tibur</i>, a distance of about
20 miles, was continued from thence, in the
same direction, under the name of the <span class="smcap">Via
Valeria</span>, and traversing the country of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
Sabines passed through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carseoli</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corfinium</i>
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aternum</i> on the Adriatic, thence to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adria</i>, and so along the coast to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castrum
Truentinum</i>, where it fell into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Salaria</i>.&mdash;6.
The <span class="smcap">Via Nomentana</span>, anciently
<span class="smcap">Ficulnensis</span>, ran from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta Collina</i>,
crossed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anio</i> to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nomentum</i>, and a little

The <span class="smcap">Via Salaria</span>, also from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta
Collina</i> (passing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fidenae</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crustumerium</i>)
ran north and east through Sabinum and
Picenum to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Reate</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Asculum Picenum</i>. At
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castrum Truentinum</i> it reached the coast,
which it followed until it joined the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via
Flaminia</i> at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ancona</i>.&mdash;8. The <span class="smcap">Via Flaminia</span>,
the <em>Great North Road</em>, carried ultimately to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ariminum</i>. It issued from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta Flaminia</i>,
and proceeded nearly north to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ocriculum</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Narnia</i> in Umbria. Here a branch
struck off, making a sweep to the east through
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Interamna</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spoletium</i>, and fell again
into the main trunk (which passed through
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mevania</i>) at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fulginia</i>. It continued through
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fanum Flaminii</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nuceria</i>, where it again
divided, one line running nearly straight to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fanum Fortunae</i> on the Adriatic, while the
other diverging to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ancona</i> continued from
thence along the coast to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fanum Fortunae</i>,
where the two branches uniting passed on
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ariminum</i> through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pisaurum</i>. From
thence the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Flaminia</i> was extended under
the name of the <span class="smcap">Via Aemilia</span>, and traversed
the heart of Cisalpine Gaul through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bononia</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mutina</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parma</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Placentia</i> (where it
crossed the Po), to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mediolanum</i>.&mdash;9. The
<span class="smcap">Via Aurelia</span>, the <em>Great Coast Road</em>, issued
originally from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta Janiculensis</i>, and
subsequently from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta Aurelia</i>. It
reached the coast at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alsium</i>, and followed
the shore of the lower sea along Etruria
and Liguria by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Genoa</i> as far as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Forum Julii</i>
in Gaul. In the first instance it extended
no farther than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pisa</i>.&mdash;10. The <span class="smcap">Via Portuensis</span>
kept the right bank of the Tiber to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Portus Augusti</i>.&mdash;11. The <span class="smcap">Via Ostiensis</span>
originally passed through the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta Trigemina</i>,
afterwards through the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porta Ostiensis</i>,
and kept the left bank of the Tiber to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostia</i>.
From thence it was continued under the
name of <span class="smcap">Via Severiana</span> along the coast
southward through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laurentum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antium</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Circaei</i>, till it joined the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Appia</i> at <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tarracina</i>.
The <span class="smcap">Via Laurentina</span>, leading direct
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laurentum</i>, seems to have branched off
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Ostiensis</i> at a short distance
from Rome.&mdash;12. The <span class="smcap">Via Ardeatina</span> from
Rome to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ardea</i>. According to some this
branched off from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Via Appia</i>, and thus
the circuit of the city is completed.</p>


<p id="Viaticum">VĬĀTĬCUM is, properly speaking, everything
necessary for a person setting out on a
journey, and thus comprehends money, provisions,
dresses, vessels, &amp;c. When a Roman
magistrate, praetor, proconsul, or quaestor
went to his province, the state provided him
with all that was necessary for his journey.
But as the state in this, as in most other
cases of expenditure, preferred paying a sum
at once to having any part in the actual
business, it engaged contractors (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">redemptores</i>),
who for a stipulated sum had to provide
the magistrates with the viaticum, the
principal parts of which appear to have been
beasts of burden and tents (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">muli et tabernacula</i>).
Augustus introduced some modification
of this system, as he once for all fixed
a certain sum to be given to the proconsuls
(probably to other provincial magistrates
also) on setting out for their provinces, so
that the redemptores had no more to do
with it.</p>


<p id="Viator">VĬĀTOR, a servant who attended upon
and executed the commands of certain Roman
magistrates, to whom he bore the same relation
as the lictor did to other magistrates.
The name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viatores</i> was derived from the circumstance
of their being chiefly employed on
messages either to call upon senators to attend
the meeting of the senate, or to summon
people to the comitia, &amp;c. In the earlier
times of the republic we find viatores as
ministers of such magistrates also as had
their lictors: viatores of a dictator and of
the consuls are mentioned by Livy. In
later times, however, viatores are only mentioned
with such magistrates as had only
potestas and not imperium, such as the tribunes
of the people, the censors, and the
aediles.</p>


<p id="Victima">VICTIMA. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Sacrificium">Sacrificium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Vicesima">VĪCĒSĬMA, a tax of five per cent. Every
Roman, when he manumitted a slave, had to
pay to the state a tax of one-twentieth of his
value, whence the tax was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vicesima
manumissionis</i>. This tax was first imposed
by the Lex Manlia (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 357), and was not
abolished when all other imposts were done
away with in Rome and Italy. A tax called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vicesima hereditatum et legatorum</i> was introduced
by Augustus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lex Julia Vicesimaria</i>):
it consisted of five per cent., which every
Roman citizen had to pay to the aerarium
militare, upon any inheritance or legacy left
to him, with the exception of such as were
left to a citizen by his nearest relatives, and
such as did not amount to above a certain
sum. It was levied in Italy and the provinces
by procuratores appointed for the
purpose.</p>


<p id="Vicomagistri">VĪCOMĂGISTRI. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Vicus">Vicus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Vicus">VĪCUS, the name of the subdivisions into
which the four regions occupied by the four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
city tribes of Servius Tullius were divided,
while the country regions, according to an
institution ascribed to Numa, were subdivided
into pagi. This division, together with that
of the four regions of the four city tribes,
remained down to the time of Augustus, who
made the vici subdivisions of the fourteen
regions into which he divided the city. In
this division each vicus consisted of one main
street, including several smaller by-streets;
their number was 424, and each was superintended
by four officers, called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vico-magistri</i>,
who had a sort of local police, and who, according
to the regulation of Augustus, were
every year chosen by lot from among the
people who lived in the vicus. On certain
days, probably at the celebration of the compitalia,
they wore the praetexta, and each
of them was accompanied by two lictors.
These officers, however, were not a new institution
of Augustus, for they had existed
during the time of the republic, and had had
the same functions as a police for the vici of
the Servian division of the city.</p>

<p id="Vigintisexviri">VĪGINTĬSEXVĬRI, twenty-six magistratus
minores, among whom were included the Triumviri
Capitales, the Triumviri Monetales,
the Quatuorviri Viarum Curandarum for the
city, the two Curatores Viarum for the roads
outside the city, the Decemviri Litibus
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stlitibus</i>) Judicandis, and the four praefects
who were sent into Campania for the purpose
of administering justice there. Augustus
reduced the number of officers of this college
to twenty (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vigintiviri</i>), as the two curatores
viarum for the roads outside the city and the
four Campanian praefects were abolished.
Down to the time of Augustus the sons of
senators had generally sought and obtained
a place in the college of the vigintisexviri, it
being the first step towards the higher offices
of the republic; but in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 13 a senatusconsultum
was passed, ordaining that only
equites should be eligible to the college of
the vigintiviri. The consequence of this was
that the vigintiviri had no seats in the
senate, unless they had held some other
magistracy which conferred this right upon
them. The age at which a person might
become a vigintivir appears to have been
twenty.</p>

<p id="Villa">VILLA, a farm or country-house. The
Roman writers mention two kinds of villa,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villa rustica</i> or farm-house, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villa
urbana</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pseudo-urbana</i>, a residence in the
country or in the suburbs of a town. When
both of these were attached to an estate they
were generally united in the same range of
buildings, but sometimes they were placed at
different parts of the estate. The interior
arrangements of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villa urbana</i> corresponded
for the most part to those of a town-house.
[<span class="smcap"><a href="#Domus">Domus</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Villicus">VILLĬCUS, a slave who had the superintendence
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villa rustica</i>, and of all the
business of the farm, except the cattle, which
were under the care of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magister pecoris</i>.
The word was also used to describe a person
to whom the management of any business
was entrusted.</p>


<p id="Vinalia">VĪNĀLĬA. There were two festivals of
this name celebrated by the Romans: the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vinalia urbana</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">priora</i>, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vinalia
rustica</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">altera</i>. The vinalia urbana were
celebrated on the 23rd of April, when the
wine-casks which had been filled the preceding
autumn were opened for the first time,
and the wine tasted. The rustic vinalia,
which fell on the 19th of August, and was
celebrated by the inhabitants of all Latium,
was the day on which the vintage was opened.
On this occasion the flamen dialis offered
lambs to Jupiter, and while the flesh of the
victims lay on the altar, he broke with his
own hands a bunch of grapes from a vine,
and by this act he, as it were, opened the
vintage, and no must was allowed to be conveyed
into the city until this solemnity was
performed. This day was sacred to Jupiter,
and Venus too appears to have had a share
in it.</p>

<p id="Vinea">VĪNĔA, in its literal signification, is a
bower formed of the branches of vines; and,
from the protection which such a leafy roof
affords, the name was applied by the Romans
to a roof under which the besiegers of a
town protected themselves against darts,
stones, fire, and the like, which were thrown
by the besieged upon the assailants. The
whole machine formed a roof, resting upon
posts eight feet in height. The roof itself
was generally sixteen feet long and seven
broad. The wooden frame was in most cases
light, so that it could be carried by the
soldiers; sometimes, however, when the purpose
which it was to serve required great
strength, it was heavy, and then the whole
fabric probably was moved by wheels attached
to the posts. The roof was formed of
planks and wicker-work, and the uppermost
layer or layers consisted of raw hides or wet
cloth, as a protection against fire, by which
the besieged frequently destroyed the vineae.
The sides of a vinea were likewise protected
by wicker-work. Such machines were constructed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
in a safe place at some distance
from the besieged town, and then carried or
wheeled (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">agere</i>) close to its walls. Here
several of them were frequently joined together,
so that a great number of soldiers
might be employed under them. When
vineae had taken their place close to the
walls, the soldiers began their operations,
either by undermining the walls, and thus
opening a breach, or by employing the battering-ram
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aries</i>).</p>


<p id="Vinum">VĪNUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἴνος</span>). The general term for the
fermented juice of the grape. In the Homeric
poems the cultivation of the grape is
represented as familiar to the Greeks. It is
worth remarking that the only wine upon
whose excellence Homer dilates in a tone
approaching to hyperbole is represented as
having been produced on the coast of Thrace,
the region from which poetry and civilisation
spread into Hellas, and the scene of several
of the more remarkable exploits of Bacchus.
Hence we might infer that the Pelasgians
introduced the culture of the vine when they
wandered westward across the Hellespont,
and that in like manner it was conveyed to
the valley of the Po, when at a subsequent
period they made their way round the head
of the Adriatic. It seems certain that wine
was both rare and costly in the earlier ages
of Roman history. As late as the time of the
Samnite wars, Papirius the dictator, when
about to join in battle with the Samnites,
vowed to Jupiter only a small cupful (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vini
pocillum</i>) if he should gain the victory. In
the times of Marius and Sulla foreign wines
were considered far superior to native
growths; but the rapidity with which luxury
spread in this matter is well illustrated by
the saying of M. Varro, that Lucullus when a
boy never saw an entertainment in his
father’s house, however splendid, at which
Greek wine was handed round more than
once, but when in manhood he returned from
his Asiatic conquests he bestowed on the
people a largess of more than a hundred
thousand cadi. Four different kinds of wine
are said to have been presented for the first
time at the feast given by Julius Caesar in
his third consulship (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 46.), these being
Falernian, Chian, Lesbian, and Mamertine,
and not until after this date were the merits
of the numerous varieties, foreign and domestic,
accurately known and fully appreciated.
But during the reign of Augustus
and his immediate successors the study of
wines became a passion, and the most scrupulous
care was bestowed upon every process
connected with their production and preservation.
Pliny calculates that the number of
wines in the whole world deserving to be accounted
of high quality (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nobilia</i>) amounted to
eighty, of which his own country could claim
two-thirds; and that 195 distinct kinds
might be reckoned up, and that if all the
varieties of these were to be included in the
computation, the sum would be almost doubled.&mdash;The
process followed in wine-making was
essentially the same among both the Greeks
and the Romans. After the grapes had been
gathered they were first trodden with the
feet in a vat (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ληνός</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">torcular</i>); but as this
process did not press out all the juice of the
grapes, they were subjected to the more
powerful pressure of a thick and heavy beam
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prelum</i>) for the purpose of obtaining all the
juice yet remaining in them. From the press
the sweet unfermented juice flowed into
another large vat, which was sunk below the
level of the press, and therefore called the
<em>under wine-vat</em>, in Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑπολήνιον</span>, in Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lacus</i>. A portion of the must was used at
once, being drunk fresh after it had been clarified
with vinegar. When it was desired to
preserve a quantity in the sweet state, an
amphora was taken and coated with pitch
within and without, and corked so as to be
perfectly air-tight. It was then immersed in
a tank of cold fresh water or buried in wet
sand, and allowed to remain for six weeks or
two months. The contents after this process
were found to remain unchanged for a year,
and hence the name <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀεὶ γλεῦκος</span>, <em>i.e.</em> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">semper
mustum</i>. A considerable quantity of must from
the best and oldest vines was inspissated by
boiling, being then distinguished by the
Greeks under the general names of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἕψημα</span> or
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γλύξις</span>, while the Latin writers have various
terms according to the extent to which the
evaporation was carried. Thus, when the
must was reduced to two-thirds of its original
volume it became <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carenum</i>, when one-half
had evaporated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">defrutum</i>, when two-thirds
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sapa</i> (known also by the Greek names <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">siraeum</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hepsema</i>), but these words are frequently
interchanged. Similar preparations are at
the present time called in Italy <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">musto cotto</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sapa</i>, and in France <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sabe</i>. The process
was carried on in large caldrons of lead (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vasa
defrutaria</i>), over a slow fire of chips, on a
night when there was no moon, the scum
being carefully removed with leaves, and the
liquid constantly stirred to prevent it from
burning. These grape-jellies, for they were
nothing else, were used extensively for giving
body to poor wines and making them keep,
and entered as ingredients into many drinks,
such as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">burranica potio</i>, so called from
its red colour, which was formed by mixing
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sapa</i> with milk. The whole of the mustum
not employed for some of the above purposes
was conveyed from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lacus</i> to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella vinaria</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
an apartment on the ground-floor or a
little below the surface. Here were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolia</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πίθοι</span>), otherwise called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seriae</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cupae</i>, long
bell-mouthed vessels of earthenware, very
carefully formed of the best clay, and lined
with a coating of pitch. They were usually
sunk (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">depressa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">defossa</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">demersa</i>) one-half or
two-thirds in the ground; to the former
depth, if the wine to be contained was likely
to prove strong, to the latter if weak. In
these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dolia</i> the process of fermentation took
place, which usually lasted for about nine
days, and as soon as it had subsided, and the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mustum</i> had become <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vinum</i>, the dolia were
closely covered. The lids (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">opercula doliorum</i>),
were taken off about once every thirty-six
days, and oftener in hot weather, in order to
cool and give air to the contents, to add any
preparation required to preserve them sound,
and to remove any impurities that might be
thrown up. The commoner sorts of wine
were drunk direct from the dolium, and
hence draught wine was called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vinum doliare</i>
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vinum de cupa</i>, but the finer kinds were
drawn off (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">diffundere</i>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μεταγγίζειν</span>), into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amphorae</i>.
On the outside the title of the wine
was painted, the date of the vintage being
marked by the names of the consuls then in
office. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Amphora">Amphora</a>.</span>] The amphorae were
then stored up in repositories (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apothecae</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">horrea</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulata</i>), completely distinct from
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cella vinaria</i>, and usually placed in the
upper story of the house (whence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">descende</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testa</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deripere horreo</i> in Horace), for a
reason explained afterwards. It is manifest
that wine prepared and bottled in the manner
described above must have contained a
great quantity of dregs and sediment, and it
became absolutely necessary to separate these
before it was drunk. This was sometimes
effected by fining with yolks of eggs, those of
pigeons being considered most appropriate
by the fastidious, but more commonly by
simply straining through small cup-like utensils
of silver or bronze perforated with numerous
small holes. Occasionally a piece of linen
cloth (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σάκκος</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saccus</i>) was placed over the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">colum</i>, and the wine filtered through. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Colum">Colum</a>.</span>]
In all the best wines hitherto described the
grapes are supposed to have been gathered
as soon as they were fully ripe, and fermentation
to have run its full course. But a
great variety of sweet wines were manufactured
by checking the fermentation, or by
partially drying the grapes, or by converting
them completely into raisins. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passum</i> or
<em>raisin-wine</em> was made from grapes dried in
the sun until they had lost half their weight,
or they were plunged into boiling oil, which
produced a similar effect, or the bunches
after they were ripe were allowed to hang
for some weeks upon the vine, the stalks
being twisted or an incision made into the
pith of the bearing shoot so as to put a stop
to vegetation. The stalks and stones were
removed, the raisins were steeped in must or
good wine, and then trodden or subjected to
the gentle action of the press. The quantity
of juice which flowed forth was measured,
and an equal quantity of water added to the
pulpy residuum, which was again pressed,
and the product employed for an inferior
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">passum</i> called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundarium</i>. The passum of
Crete was most prized, and next in rank
were those of Cilicia, Africa, Italy, and the
neighbouring provinces. The kinds known
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psythium</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melampsythium</i> possessed
the peculiar flavour of the grape and not
that of wine. The grapes most suitable for
passum were those which ripened early,
especially the varieties <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apiana</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scirpula</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Psithia</i>. The Greeks recognised three colours
in wines: <em>red</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέλας</span>), <em>white</em>, i.e. pale
straw-colour (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λευκός</span>), and brown or amber-coloured
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κιῤῥός</span>). The Romans distinguish
four: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albus</i>, answering to <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λευκός</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fulvus</i> to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κιῤῥός</span>, while <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μέλας</span> is subdivided into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanguineus</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">niger</i>, the former being doubtless
applied to bright glowing wines like
Tent and Burgundy, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">niger</i> or

that wine intended for keeping was racked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
off from the dolia into amphorae. When it
was necessary in the first instance to transport
it from one place to another, or when
carried by travellers on a journey, it was
contained in bags made of goat-skin (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀσκοί</span>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">utres</i>) well pitched over so as to make the
seams perfectly tight.</p>

<p>As the process of
wine-making among the ancients was for the
most part conducted in an unscientific manner,
it was found necessary, except in the
case of the finest varieties, to have recourse
to various devices for preventing or correcting
acidity, heightening the flavour, and increasing
the durability of the second growths.
The object in view was accomplished sometimes
by merely mixing different kinds of
wine together, but more frequently by throwing
into the dolia or amphorae various condiments
or seasonings (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρτύσεις</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">medicamina</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditurae</i>). The principal substances employed
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditurae</i> were, 1. sea-water;
2. turpentine, either pure, or in the form
of pitch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pix</i>), tar (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pix liquida</i>), or resin
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">resina</i>). 3. Lime, in the form of gypsum,
burnt marble, or calcined shells. 4. Inspissated
must. 5. Aromatic herbs, spices,
and gums; and these were used either
singly, or cooked up into a great variety of
complicated confections. But not only were
spices and gums steeped in wine or incorporated
during fermentation, but even the
precious perfumed essential oils (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">unguenta</i>)
were mixed with it before it was drunk
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μυῤῥίνη</span>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">murrhina</i>.) Of these compound beverages
the most popular was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oenomeli</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰνόμελι</span>) of the Greeks, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mulsum</i> of the
Romans. This was of two kinds; in the one
honey was mixed with wine, in the other
with must. The former was said to have
been invented by the legendary hero Aristaeus,
the first cultivator of bees, and was
considered most perfect and palatable when
made of some old rough (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">austerum</i>) wine,
such as Massic or Falernian (although Horace
objects to the latter for this purpose),
and new Attic honey. The proportions were
four, by measure, of wine to one of honey,
and various spices and perfumes, such as
myrrh, cassia, costum, malobathrum, nard,
and pepper, might be added. The second
kind was made of must evaporated to one
half of its original bulk, Attic honey being
added in the proportion of one to ten. This,
therefore, was merely a very rich fruit
syrup, in no way allied to wine. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mulsum</i>
was considered the most appropriate draught
upon an empty stomach, and was therefore
swallowed immediately before the regular
business of a repast began and hence the whet
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gustatio</i>) coming before the cup of mulsum
was called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">promulsis</i>. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mulsum</i> was given
at a triumph by the imperator to his soldiers.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mulsum</i> (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vinum</i>) or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oenomeli</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἰνόμελι</span>) is
perfectly distinct from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mulsa</i> (sc. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aqua</i>). The
latter, or <em>mead</em>, being made of honey and
water mixed and fermented, is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melicraton</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελίκρατον</span>) or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hydromeli</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὑδρόμελι</span>) of the
Greeks. The ancients considered old wine
not only more grateful to the palate, but also
more wholesome and invigorating. Generally
speaking the Greek wines do not seem
to have required a long time to ripen. Nestor
in the Odyssey, indeed, drinks wine ten
years old; but the connoisseurs under the
empire pronounced that all transmarine
wines arrived at a moderate degree of maturity
in six or seven. Many of the Italian
varieties, however, required to be kept for
twenty or twenty-five years before they were
drinkable (which is now considered ample
for our strongest ports), and even the humble
growths of Sabinum were stored up for from
four to fifteen. Hence it became a matter
of importance to hasten, if possible, the natural
process. This was attempted in various
ways, sometimes by elaborate condiments,
sometimes by sinking vessels containing the
must in the sea, by which an artificial mellowness
was induced (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praecox vetustas</i>) and
the wine in consequence termed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">thalassites</i>;
but more usually by the application of heat.
Thus it was customary to expose the amphorae
for some years to the full fervour of
the sun’s rays, or to construct the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">apothecae</i>
in such a manner as to be exposed to the hot
air and smoke of the bath-furnaces, and
hence the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fumaria</i> applied to such
apartments, and the phrases <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fumosos</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fumum
bibere</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuligine testae</i>, in reference to the
wines. If the operation was not conducted
with care, and the amphorae not stoppered
down perfectly tight, a disagreeable effect
would be produced on the contents. In Italy,
in the first century of the Christian aera, the
lowest market price of the most ordinary
quality of wine was 300 sesterces for 40
urnae, that is, 15 sesterces for the amphora,
or 6<em>d.</em> a gallon nearly. At a much earlier
date, the triumph of L. Metellus during the
first Punic war (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 250), wine was sold at
the rate of 8 asses the amphora. The price
of native wine at Athens was four drachmas
for the metretes, that is, about 4½<em>d.</em> the
gallon, when necessaries were dear, and
we may perhaps assume one half of this
sum as the average of cheaper times. On
the other hand, high prices were given freely
for the varieties held in esteem, since as
early as the time of Socrates a metretes of
Chian sold for a mina.&mdash;With respect to
the way in which wine was drunk, and
the customs observed by the Greeks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
Romans at their drinking entertainments, the
reader is referred to the article <span class="smcap"><a href="#Symposium">Symposium</a></span>.&mdash;The
wine of most early celebrity was that
which the minister of Apollo, Maron, who
dwelt upon the skirts of Thracian Ismarus,
gave to Ulysses. It was red (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐρυθρόν</span>), and
honey-sweet (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μελιηδέα</span>), so precious, that it
was unknown to all in the mansion save
the wife of the priest and one trusty house-keeper;
so strong, that a single cup was mingled
with twenty of water; so fragrant, that
even when thus diluted it diffused a divine
and most tempting perfume. Homer mentions
also more than once <em>Pramnian wine</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οἴνος
Πραμνεῖος</span>), an epithet which is variously interpreted
by different writers. In after times
a wine bearing the same name was produced
in the island of Icaria, around the hill village
of Latorea in the vicinity of Ephesus,
in the neighbourhood of Smyrna, near the
shrine of Cybele, and in Lesbos. But the
wines of greatest renown at a later period
were grown in the islands of Thasos, Lesbos,
Chios, and Cos, and in a few favoured spots
on the opposite coast of Asia, such as the
slopes of Mount Tmolus, the ridge which
separates the valley of the Hermus from that
of the Caÿster, Mount Messogis, which divides
the tributaries of the Caÿster from
those of the Meander, the volcanic region of
the Catacecaumene, which still retains its
fame, the environs of Ephesus, of Cnidus, of
Miletus, and of Clazomenae. Among these
the first place seems to have been by general
consent conceded to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chian</i>, of which
the most delicious varieties were brought
from the heights of Ariusium in the central
parts, and from the promontory of Phanae
at the southern extremity of the island.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thasian</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lesbian</i> occupied the second
place, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coan</i> disputed the palm
with them. In Lesbos the most highly
prized vineyards were around Mytilene and
Methymna. There is no foundation whatever
for the remark that the finest Greek
wines, especially the products of the islands
in the Aegean and Ionian seas, belonged for
the most part to the luscious sweet class. The
very reverse is proved by the epithets <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αὐστηρός</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σκληρός</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λεπτός</span>, and the like, applied
to a great number, while <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γλυκύς</span> and
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γλυκάζων</span> are designations comparatively rare,
except in the vague language of poetry.&mdash;The
most noble Italian wines, with a very few
exceptions, were derived from Latium and
Campania, and for the most part grew within
a short distance of the sea. In the first
rank we must place the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Setinum</i>, which
fairly deserves the title of <em>Imperial</em>, since it
was the chosen beverage of Augustus and
most of his courtiers. It grew upon the hills
of Setia, above Forum Appii, looking down
upon the Pomptine marshes. Before the age
of Augustus the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caecubum</i> was the most
prized of all. It grew in the poplar swamps
bordering on the gulf of Amyclae, close to
Fundi. In the time of Pliny its reputation
was entirely gone, partly in consequence of
the carelessness of the cultivators, and partly
from its proper soil, originally a very limited
space, having been cut up by the canal of
Nero extending from Baiae to Ostia. It was
full-bodied and heady, not arriving at maturity
until it had been kept for many years.
The second rank was occupied by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falernum</i>,
of which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Faustianum</i> was the most
choice variety, having gained its character
from the care and skill exercised in the cultivation
of the vines. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falernus ager</i>
commenced at the Pons Campanus, on the
left hand of those journeying towards the
Urbana Colonia of Sulla, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Faustianus ager</i>
at a village about six miles from Sinuessa,
so that the whole district in question may be
regarded as stretching from the Massic hills
to the river Vulturnus. Falernian became
fit for drinking in ten years, and might be
used until twenty years old, but when kept
longer <ins class="corr" id="tn-419" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'gave headachs'">
gave headaches</ins>, and proved injurious
to the nervous system. Pliny distinguishes
three kinds, the rough (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">austerum</i>), the sweet
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dulce</i>), and the thin (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tenue</i>). Others arranged
the varieties differently; that which
grew upon the hill tops they called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caucinum</i>,
that on the middle slopes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Faustianum</i>,
and that on the plain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falernum</i>. In the
third rank was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Albanum</i>, from the Mons
Albanus, of various kinds, very sweet (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">praedulce</i>),
sweetish, rough, and sharp; it was
invigorating (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nervis utile</i>), and in perfection
after being kept for fifteen years. Here too
we place the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Surrentinum</i>, from the promontory
forming the southern horn of the bay of
Naples, which was not drinkable until it had
been kept for five-and-twenty years, for,
being destitute of richness, and very dry, it
required a long time to ripen, but was
strongly recommended to convalescents, on
account of its thinness and wholesomeness.
Of equal reputation were the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Massicum</i>, from
the hills which formed the boundary between
Latium and Campania, although somewhat
harsh, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gauranum</i>, from the
ridge above Baiae and Puteoli, produced in
small quantity, but of very high quality,
full-bodied, and thick. In the same class
are to be included the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calenum</i> from Cales,
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fundanum</i> from Fundi. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calenum</i>
was light and better for the stomach
than Falernian; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fundanum</i> was full-bodied
and nourishing, but apt to attack both
stomach and head; therefore little sought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
after at banquets. This list is closed by the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veliturninum</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Privernatinum</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Signinum</i>,
from Velitrae, Privernum, and Signia, towns
on the Volscian hills; the first was a sound
wine, but had this peculiarity, that it always
tasted as if mixed with some foreign substance;
the second was thin and pleasant;
the last was looked upon only in the light of
a medicine valuable for its astringent qualities.
We may safely bring in one more,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Formianum</i>, from the Gulf of Caieta,
associated by Horace with the Caecuban,
Falernian, and Calenian. The fourth rank
contained the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mamertinum</i>, from the neighbourhood
of Messana, first brought into
fashion by Julius Caesar. The finest was
sound, light, and at the same time not without
body.</p>

<p id="Vis">VIS. Leges were passed at Rome for the
purpose of preventing acts of violence. The
Lex Plotia or Plautia was enacted against
those who occupied public places and carried
arms. The lex proposed by the consul
Q. Catulus on the subject, with the assistance
of Plautius the tribunus, appears to be
the Lex Plotia. There was a Lex Julia of
the dictator Caesar on this subject, which
imposed the penalty of exile. Two Juliae
Leges were passed as to this matter in the
time of Augustus, which were respectively
entitled De Vi Publica and De Vi Privata.</p>

<p id="Vitrum">VITRUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕαλος</span>), glass. A story has been
preserved by Pliny, that glass was first discovered
accidentally by some merchants who,
having landed on the Syrian coast at the
mouth of the river Belus, and being unable
to find stones to support their cooking-pots,
fetched for this purpose from their ships
some of the lumps of nitre which composed
the cargo. This being fused by the heat of
the fire, united with the sand upon which it
rested, and formed a stream of vitrified matter.
No conclusion can be drawn from this
tale, even if true, in consequence of its
vagueness; but it probably originated in
the fact, that the sand of the district in
question was esteemed peculiarly suitable for
glass-making, and exported in great quantities
to the workshops of Sidon and Alexandria,
long the most famous in the ancient
world. Alexandria sustained its reputation
for many centuries: Rome derived a great
portion of its supplies from this source, and
as late as the reign of Aurelian we find the
manufacture still flourishing. There is some
difficulty in deciding by what Greek author
glass is first mentioned, because the term
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕαλος</span> unquestionably denotes not only artificial
glass but rock-crystal, or indeed any
transparent stone or stone-like substance.
Thus the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὕελος</span> of Herodotus, in which the
Ethiopians encased the bodies of their dead,
cannot be glass, for we are expressly told
that it was dug in abundance out of the
earth; and hence commentators have conjectured
that rock-crystal or rock-salt, or
amber, or oriental alabaster, or some bituminous
or gummy product, might be indicated.
But when the same historian, in
his account of sacred crocodiles, states that
they were decorated with ear-rings made of
melted stone, we may safely conclude that he
intends to describe some vitreous ornament
for which he knew no appropriate name.
Glass is, however, first mentioned with certainty
by Theophrastus, who notices the
circumstance alluded to above, of the fitness
of the sand at the mouth of the river Belus
for the fabrication of glass. Among the
Latin writers Lucretius appears to be the
first in which the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitrum</i> occurs; but it
must have been well known to his countrymen
long before, for Cicero names it along
with paper and linen, as a common article
of merchandise brought from Egypt. Scaurus,
in his aedileship (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 58), made a display
of it such as was never witnessed even in
after-times; for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scena</i> of his gorgeous
theatre was divided into three tiers, of which
the under portion was of marble, the upper of
gilded wood, and the middle compartment of
glass. In the poets of the Augustan age it is
constantly introduced, both directly and in
similes, and in such terms as to prove that it
was an object with which every one must be
familiar. Strabo declares that in his day a
small drinking-cup of glass might be purchased
at Rome for half an as, and so common
was it in the time of Juvenal and
Martial, that old men and women made a
livelihood by trucking sulphur matches for
broken fragments. When Pliny wrote, manufactories
had been established not only in
Italy, but in Spain and Gaul also, and glass
drinking-cups had entirely superseded those
of gold and silver; and in the reign of Alexander
Severus we find <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitrearii</i> ranked along
with curriers, coachmakers, goldsmiths, silversmiths,
and other ordinary artificers whom
the emperor taxed to raise money for his
thermae. The numerous specimens transmitted
to us prove that the ancients were well
acquainted with the art of imparting a great
variety of colours to their glass; they were
probably less successful in their attempts to
render it perfectly pure and free from all
colour, since we are told that it was considered
most valuable in this state. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
wrought according to the different methods
now practised, being fashioned into the required
shape by the blowpipe, <em>cut</em>, as we
term it, although <em>ground</em> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">teritur</i>) is a more
accurate phrase, upon a wheel, and engraved
with a sharp tool like silver. The art of
etching upon glass, now so common, was entirely
unknown, since it depends upon the
properties of fluoric acid, a chemical discovery
of the last century. The following were the
chief uses to which glass was applied:&mdash;1.
Bottles, vases, cups, and cinerary urns. 2.
Glass pastes, presenting fac-similes either in
relief or intaglio of engraved precious stones.
3. Imitations of coloured precious stones,
such as the carbuncle, the sapphire, the amethyst,
and, above all, the emerald. 4. Thick
sheets of glass of various colours appear to
have been laid down for paving floors, and to
have been attached as a lining to the walls
and ceilings of apartments in dwelling houses,
just as scagliuola is frequently employed in
Italy, and occasionally in our own country
also. Rooms fitted up in this way were called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitreae camerae</i>, and the panels <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitreae quadraturae</i>.
Such was the kind of decoration
introduced by Scaurus for the scene of his
theatre, not columns nor pillars of glass as
some, nor bas-reliefs as others have imagined.
5. Glass was also used for windows. [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Domus">Domus</a></span>,

<p id="Vitta">VITTA, or plural VITTAE, a ribbon or
fillet, is to be considered, 1. As an ordinary
portion of female dress. 2. As a decoration
of sacred persons and sacred things. 1.
When considered as an ordinary portion of
female dress, it was simply a band encircling
the head, and serving to confine the tresses
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crinales vittae</i>), the ends when long (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">longae
taenia vittae</i>) hanging down behind. It was
worn by maidens, and by married women
also, the vitta assumed on the nuptial day
being of a different form from that used by
virgins. The Vitta was <em>not</em> worn by libertinae
even of fair character, much less by
meretrices; hence it was looked upon as an
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insigne pudoris</i>, and, together with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stola</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">instita</i>, served to point out at first sight
the freeborn matron. The colour was probably
a matter of choice: white and purple are
both mentioned. When employed for sacred
purposes, it was usually twisted round the
infula [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Infula">Infula</a></span>], and held together the loose
flocks of wool. Under this form it was employed
as an ornament for 1. Priests, and
those who offered sacrifice. 2. Priestesses,
especially those of Vesta, and hence <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vittata
sacerdos</i> for a vestal, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κατ’ ἐξόχην</span>. 3. Prophets
and poets, who may be regarded as
priests, and in this case the vittae were frequently
intertwined with chaplets of olive or
laurel. 4. Statues of deities. 5. Victims
decked for sacrifice. 6. Altars. 7. Temples.
8. The <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱκετήρια</span> of suppliants. The sacred
vittae, as well as the infulae, were made of
wool, and hence the epithets <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lanea</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mollis</i>.
They were white (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">niveae</i>), or purple (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puniceae</i>),
or azure (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caeruleae</i>), when wreathed
round an altar to the manes.</p>

<p id="Volones">VŎLŌNES is synonymous with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Voluntarii</i>
(from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">volo</i>), and might hence be applied to
all those who volunteered to serve in the
Roman armies without there being any obligation
to do so. But it was applied more
especially to slaves, when in times of need
they offered or were allowed to fight in the
Roman armies. Thus when during the second
Punic war, after the battle of Cannae, there
was not a sufficient number of freemen to
complete the army, about 8000 young and
able-bodied slaves offered to serve. Their
proposal was accepted; they received armour
at the public expense, and as they distinguished
themselves they were honoured with
the franchise. In after times the name volones
was retained whenever slaves chose or
were allowed to take up arms in defence of
their masters, which they were the more
willing to do, as they were generally rewarded
with the franchise.</p>

people threw into the fire. It was also customary

independence of the Greek states, had the
sole command of the confederate troops in
time of war, ordered the quotas which each
state was to furnish, and appointed officers
of their own to command them. Such officers
were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Xenagi</i>. The generals whom the
allies sent with their troops were subordinate
to these Spartan <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">xenagi</i>, though they attended
the council of war, as representatives of their
respective countries. After the peace of
Antalcidas, the league was still more firmly
established, though Argos refused to join it;
and the Spartans were rigorous in exacting
the required military service, demanding
levies by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scytale</i>, and sending out <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">xenagi</i>
to collect them. The word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Xenagus</i> may be
applied to any leader of a hand of foreigners
or mercenaries.</p>


<p id="Xenelasia">XĔNĒLĂSĬA (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενηλασία</span>). The Lacedaemonians
appear in very early times, before
the legislation of Lycurgus, to have been
averse to intercourse with foreigners. This
disposition was encouraged by the lawgiver,
who made an ordinance forbidding strangers
to reside at Sparta without special permission,
and empowering the magistrate to expel from
the city any stranger who misconducted himself,
or set an example injurious to public
morals.</p>


<p id="Xenias">XĔNĬAS GRĂPHĒ (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξενίας γραφή</span>). As no
man could be an Athenian citizen except by
birth or creation (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γένει</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποιήσει</span>), if one,
having neither of those titles, assumed to act
as a citizen, either by taking part in the popular
assembly, or by serving any office, judicial
or magisterial, or by attending certain
festivals, or doing any other act which none
but a citizen was privileged to do, he was
liable to a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γραφὴ ξενίας</span>, which any citizen
might institute against him; or he might be
proceeded against by <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰσαγγελία</span>.</p>


<p id="Xenus">XĔNUS (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξένος</span>). [<span class="smcap"><a href="#Hospitium">Hospitium</a>.</span>]</p>


<p id="Xestes">XESTES (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ξέστης</span>), a Greek measure of capacity,
both fluid and solid, which contained
12 cyathi or 2 cotylae, and was equal to ⅙ of
the chous, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>48</sub> of the Roman amphora or
quadrantal, and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>72</sub> of the Greek amphora or
metretes; or, viewing it as a dry measure,
it was half the choenix and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>96</sub> of the medimnus.
It contained ·9911 of a pint English.
At this point the Roman and Attic systems
of measures coincide; for there is no doubt
that the Attic xestes was identical with the
Roman sextarius.</p>

<p id="Zetetae">ZĒTĒTAE (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζητηταί</span>), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inquisitors</i>, were
extraordinary officers, appointed by the
Athenians to discover the authors of some
crime against the state, and bring them to
justice. They were more frequently appointed
to search for confiscated property,
the goods of condemned criminals and state
debtors; to receive and give information
against any persons who concealed, or assisted
in concealing them, and to deliver an
inventory of all such goods (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀπογράφειν</span>) to
the proper authorities.</p>


<p id="Zona">ZŌNA, also called CINGŬLUM (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζώνη</span>,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζῶμα</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζωστῆρ</span>, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίτρα</span>), a girdle or zone, worn
about the loins by both sexes. The chief use
of this article of dress was to hold up the
tunic (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζώννυσθαι</span>), which was more especially
requisite to be done when persons were at
work, on a journey, or engaged in hunting.
The zona is also represented in many statues
and pictures of men in armour as worn
round the cuirass. The girdle, mentioned
by Homer, seems to have been a constituent
part of the cuirass, serving to fasten it by
means of a buckle, and also affording an additional
protection to the body, and having a
short kind of petticoat attached to it, as is
shown in the figure of the Greek warrior in
<a href="#ill240c">p. 240</a>. The cut at p. 4 shows that the ancient
cuirass did not descend low enough to
secure that part of the body which was covered
by the ornamental kilt or petticoat.
To supply this defect was the design of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mitra</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μίτρα</span>), a brazen belt lined probably
on the inside with leather and stuffed with
wool, which was worn next to the body.
Men used their girdles to hold money instead
of a purse. As the girdle was worn to hold
up the garments for the sake of business or
of work requiring despatch, so it was loosened
and the tunic was allowed to fall down to
the feet to indicate the opposite condition,
and more especially in preparing to perform
a sacrifice (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veste recincta</i>), or funeral rites
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discincti</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incinctae</i>). A girdle was worn by
young women, even when their tunic was
not girt up, and removed on the day of marriage,
and therefore called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ζώνη παρθενική</span>.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>Most illustrations have been placed at the start, or the end, of
a dictionary entry. In some long multi-page entries with several
illustrations, a paragraph break has been inserted to allow
placement of an illustration at a relevant point of the text.</p>

<p>The original text used Y with breve (Ῠ) in 49 entry headings that
were latinized versions of a Greek word, for example ĂLῨTAE (ἀλύται).
These have been changed to Y with tilde (Ỹ), ĂLỸTAE (ἀλύται), because
there is no Y with breve in the Unicode Latin tables.</p>

<p>There are a few references in the main text to entries that do not
exist in this (Shorter) version of the Dictionary, for example:
<span class="smcap">Furtum, Atticurges</span>, and in the Classified Index there are several
dozen more, for example: Pala, Follis, Dianomae, Pyrgos.</p>

<p>Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
the text and consultation of external sources.</p>

<p>Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the
text, and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
